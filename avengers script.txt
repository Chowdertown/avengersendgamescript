(first lines; Sam Wilson is jogging around Washington, D.C. when Steve quickly catches up to him and runs past him.)\
\
Steve Rogers: On your left.\
\
(as Sam continues to jog Steve comes around again quickly after doing another lap.)\
\
Steve Rogers: On your left.\
\
Sam Wilson: Uh-huh, on my left. Got it.\
\
(as Sam is still jogging Steve comes around again from behind him from another lap.)\
\
Sam Wilson: Don't say it! Don't you say it!\
\
Steve Rogers: On your left!\
\
Sam Wilson: Come on!\
\
(Sam gets angry and tries to catch up to him but only after a few seconds he's unable to carry and stops to rest.)\
\
(as Sam is resting catching his breath sitting by a tree Steve walks over to him.)\
\
Steve Rogers: Need a medic?\
\
(Sam laughs.)\
\
Sam Wilson: I need a new set of lungs. Dude, you just ran like 13 miles in 30 minutes.\
\
Steve Rogers: I guess I got a late start.\
\
Sam Wilson: Oh, really? You should be ashamed of yourself. You should take another lap.\
\
(He hesitates for a moment before saying sarcastically.)\
\
Sam Wilson: Did you just take it? I assumed you just took it.\
\
Steve Rogers: What unit you with?\
\
Sam Wilson: 58, Pararescue. But now I'm working down at the VA.\
\
(Sam lifts hand to shake)\
\
Sam Wilson: Sam Wilson.\
\
(Steve gives Sam a hand to rise.)\
\
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.\
\
Sam Wilson: Yeah I kind of put that together. Must have freaked you out coming home after the whole defrosting thing.\
\
Steve Rogers: It takes some getting used to. It's good to meet you, Sam.\
\
(as Steve turns to leave.)\
\
Sam Wilson: It's your bed, right?\
\
Steve Rogers: What's that?\
\
Sam Wilson: Your bed, it's too soft. When I was over there I'd sleep on the ground and use rock for pillows, like a caveman. Now I'm home, lying in my bed, and it's like...\
\
Steve Rogers: Lying on a marshmallow. Feel like I'm gonna sink right to the floor.\
\
(Sam smiles and nods his head.)\
\
Steve Rogers: How long?\
\
Sam Wilson: Two tours.\
\
(Awkward Silence)\
\
Sam Wilson: You must miss the good old days, huh?\
\
Steve Rogers: Well, things aren't so bad. Food's a lot better, we used to boil everything. No polio is good. Internet, so helpful. I've been reading that a lot trying to catch up.\
\
(Sam looks up to think and raises finger)\
\
Sam Wilson: Marvin Gaye, 1972, "Trouble Man" soundtrack. Everything you've missed jammed into one album.\
\
Steve Rogers: I'll put it on the list.\
\
(Steve gets his small notebook and pen out and notes it down on his list which also includes - in the American version of the movie - I Love Lucy (Television); Moon Landing; Berlin Wall (Up + Down) Steve Jobs (Apple); Disco; Thai Food; Star Wars/Trek (with Star Wars crossed out, indicating that he has seen it); Nirvana (Band); Rocky (Rocky II?)\
\
(Steve gets a text message: "Mission alert. Extraction imminent. Meet at the curb. :)")\
\
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, duty calls. Thanks for the run. If that's what you wanna call running.\
\
(They shake hands.)\
\
Sam Wilson: Oh, that's how it is?\
\
Steve Rogers: Oh, that's how it is.\
\
Sam Wilson: (He laughs.) Okay. Any time you wanna stop by the VA, make me look awesome in front of the girl at the front desk, just let me know.\
\
Steve Rogers: I'll keep it in mind.\
\
Sam Wilson: Okay.\
\
(Just then Natasha pulls up in her car by the curb and rolls down the window.)\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, fellas. Either one of you know where the Smithsonian is? I'm here to pick up a fossil.\
\
Steve Rogers: That's hilarious.\
\
(Steve walks over to her car and gets in, Sam gives Natasha and her car an appreciative look.)\
\
Sam Wilson: How you doing?\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Hey.\
\
Steve Rogers: Can't run everywhere.\
\
Sam Wilson: No, you can't.\
\
(He watches as Natasha quickly pulls away and drives off.)\
\
(flying over the Indian Ocean the duo are with SHIELD agents, led by Brock Rumlow.)\
\
Brock Rumlow: The target is a mobile satellite launch platform: The Lemurian Star. They were sending up their last payload when pirates took them, 93 minutes ago.\
\
Steve Rogers: Any demands?\
\
Brock Rumlow: A billion and a half.\
\
Steve Rogers: Why so steep?\
\
Brock Rumlow: Because it SHIELD's.\
\
Steve Rogers: So it's not off-course, it's trespassing.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm sure they have a good reason.\
\
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm getting a little tired of being Fury's janitor.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, it's not that complicated.\
\
Steve Rogers: How many pirates?\
\
Brock Rumlow: Twenty-five, top mercs, led by this guy. Georges Batroc.\
\
(He shows them a photo of Batroc on the monitor.)\
\
Brock Rumlow: Ex-DGSE, Action Division. He's at the top of Interpol's Red Notice. Before the French demobilized him, he had thirty-six kill missions. This guy's got a rep for maximum casualties.\
\
Steve Rogers: Hostages?\
\
Brock Rumlow: Uh...mostly techs. One officer, Jasper Sitwell.\
\
(He pulls up Sitwell's photo on the monitor.)\
\
Brock Rumlow: They're in the galley.\
\
Steve Rogers: What's Sitwell doing on a launch ship? Alright, I'm gonna sweep the deck and find Batroc. Nat, you'll kill the engines and wait for instructions. Rumlow, you sweep aft, find the hostages, get them to the life-pods, get 'em out. Let's move.\
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE, you heard the Cap. Gear up.\
[as they are getting ready to dive off the jet; into his radio]\
Steve Rogers: [talking into his wrist communicator] Secure channel seven.\
Natasha Romanoff: Seven secure. Did you do anything fun Saturday night?\
Steve Rogers: Well, all the guys from my barbershop quartet are dead, so... No, not really.\
Pilot: [on radio] Coming up by the drop zone, Cap.\
Natasha Romanoff: You know, if you ask Kristen out, from Statistics, she'd probably say yes.\
Steve Rogers: That's why I don't ask.\
Natasha Romanoff: Too shy or too scared?\
Steve Rogers: Too busy!\
[Steve jumps out of the jet]\
STRIKE Agent: Was he wearing a parachute?\
[Rumlow smiles]\
Brock Rumlow: No. No, he wasn't.\
[after jumping out the jet Steve dives into the ocean and then climbs onto the ship, he then beats everyone on the deck swiftly before anyone raises the alarm when he's interrupted by one of the pirates pointing his gun at him]\
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas! Bouge pas. (Don't move! Don't move.)\
[he's shot dead by Rumlow as he parachutes down onto the deck behind Steve]\
Steve Rogers: Thanks.\
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. You seemed pretty helpless without me.\
[Natasha and another agent parachute down onto the deck to join them]\
Natasha Romanoff: What about the nurse that lives across the hall from you? She seems kind of nice.\
Steve Rogers: Secure the engine room, then find me a date.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm multitasking.\
(Natasha Jumps down to the lower deck)\
[below deck we see the pirates are holding the ship's crew, including Sitwell, hostage]\
French Pirate #1: J'ai dit \'e0 Batroc que si on veut que le SHIELD nous paye, commence \'e0 leur envoyer des corps maintenant ! ([subtitled] I said to Batroc, if we want SHIELD to pay, we have to start sending them bodies now!) [to the hostages]. Une balle pour quelqu'un ([subtitled] I have a bullet for someone). [shouting in English] You want a bullet in your head?! T'en veux une. Hein ! (Do you want one? Eh?) [he kicks one of the hostage's leg]. Bouge ton pied. Tu veux une balle dans la t\'eate ? ([subtitled] Move that leg. Want a bullet in your head?)\
[meanwhile on the deck Steve moves quickly to find the hostages; in the control room]\
Georges Batroc: J'aime pas attendre. Appelle Durand. Je veux que l'on s'arrache d\'e8s que la ranson arrive. ([subtitled] I do not like to wait. Call Durand. I want the ship ready to move when the ransom arrives.)\
French Pirate: Oui, Batroc ([subtitled] Yes, Batroc.)\
[he makes the call]\
French Pirate: Durand. D\'e9marre le moteur.([subtitled] Durand. Start the engine.)\
Durand: Okay.\
[Durand puts the phone down, turns and sees Natasha behind him]\
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, sailor.\
[she quickly knocks him down and manages to swing down below deck shooting several of the pirates on the way]\
[to one of the hostages]\
French Pirate: Ferme ta gueule ! ([subtitled] Shut up.)\
French Pirate #1: Bouge pas toi ! Mais qu'est ce qui se passe ! Tu veux jouer les h\'e9ros, c'est \'e7a ! T'as pas int\'e9r\'eat ! ([subtitled] What is it? Want to be a hero?)\
[he looks at the hostages who keep their heads down]\
French Pirate #1: Bon, j'ai trop attendu l\'e0. ([subtitled] Well, I've waited long enough.)\
[he goes over to the locked door and bangs on it to get the attention of the pirate guarding outside]\
French Pirate #1: H\'e9, trouve Batroc, si j'ai pas de nouvelles dans deux minutes, je commence \'e0 les tuer. ([subtitled] Hey, look for Batroc. If I do not hear anything in two minutes, I'll start to kill them!)\
French Pirate #2: D'accord. Je vais le chercher ! ([subtitled] Okay. I'll find him!)\
[as the pirate turns to leave Rumlow, who's standing behind him with a stun gun, shoots him, on the other side of the door the other pirate senses something but dismisses it]\
French Pirate #1: Deux minutes. ([subtitled] Two minutes.)\
[we see Rumlow and another STRIKE Agent places a bomb on the locked door]\
[in the control room]\
French Pirate: Silence radio du SHIELD, Batroc. ([subtitled] Radio silence from SHIELD, Batroc.)\
[Steve watches them from the deck, we see another STRIKE agent getting in position]\
STRIKE Agent: Targets acquired.\
[below deck Rumlow points his gun at the bomb placed against door where the hostages are being kept]\
Brock Rumlow: STRIKE in position.\
[into his radio]\
Steve Rogers: Natasha, what's your status?\
[we see Natasha jumping down below deck to knock out one of the pirates]\
Steve Rogers: Status, Natasha?\
Natasha Romanoff: Hang on!\
[as the pirate attacks her she quickly knocks him out; into her radio]\
Natasha Romanoff: Engine room secure.\
[Natasha grabs a pipe from the ground and knocks out one of the pirates]\
French Pirate #1: Le temps est \'e9coul\'e9. Qui veut mourrir en premier. H\'e9 toi ! Prend la fille. [subtitled] Time's up. Who wants to die first? [to one of his men] Hey, you! Take the girl.\
[into his radio]\
Steve Rogers: On my mark. Three. Two. One.\
[the STRIKE team start shooting at the pirates, blow open the door and Rumlow quickly kills the head pirate]\
Jasper Sitwell: I told you, SHIELD doesn't negotiate.\
[back in the control room one of Batroc's men tries to get hold of the pirate below deck]\
French Pirate: Halo ? Je pense que la ligne est morte.J'ai perdu le contact. ([subtitled] Hello? Batroc, the line is dead. I lost contact with them.)\
[just then Steve smashes in through the window using his shield but Batroc manages to escape]\
[to Steve as he goes looking for Batroc]\
Brock Rumlow: Hostages en route to extraction. Romanoff missed the rendezvous point, Cap. Hostiles are still in play.\
Steve Rogers: Natasha, Batroc's on the move. Circle back to Rumlow and protect the hostages.\
[there's no reply from Natasha]\
Steve Rogers: Natasha!\
[suddenly Batroc attacks Steve, they fight on the deck of the ship, with Batroc getting quickly back up on his feet]\
Georges Batroc: Je croyais que tu \'e9tais plus qu'un bouclier. ([subtitled:] I thought that you were more than just a shield.)\
[Steve puts the shield on his back and takes off his mask]\
Steve Rogers: On va voir. ([subtitled:] Let's see.)\
[they start fighting again, Steve manages to finally knock Batroc down by smashing through into one of the rooms where Natasha is downloading something from the computer]\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is awkward.\
Steve Rogers: What are you doing?\
Natasha Romanoff: Backing up the hard drive. It's a good habit to get into.\
Steve Rogers: Rumlow needed your help. What the hell are you doing here?\
[Steve goes over to Natasha and looks at what Natasha is backing up]\
Steve Rogers: You're saving SHIELD Intel.\
Natasha Romanoff: Whatever I can get my hands on.\
Steve Rogers: Our mission is to rescue hostages.\
Natasha Romanoff: No. That's your mission.\
[she finishes backing up and pulls the flash drive out]\
Natasha Romanoff: And you've done it beautifully.\
[as Natasha goes to leave Steve grabs her arm]\
Steve Rogers: You just jeopardized this whole operation.\
Natasha Romanoff: I think that's overstating things.\
[suddenly Batroc rises and throws a grenade at the two as he runs off, Steve deflects the bomb with his shield, grabs Natasha and jumps through a window before it explodes]\
Natasha Romanoff: Okay. That one's on me.\
Steve Rogers: You're damn right.\
[The Triskelion, S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters; Steve walks into Fury's office]\
Steve Rogers: You just can't stop yourself from lying, can you?\
Nick Fury: I didn't lie. Agent Romanoff had a different mission than yours.\
Steve Rogers: Which you didn't feel obliged to share.\
Nick Fury: I'm not obliged to do anything.\
Steve Rogers: Those hostages could've died, Nick.\
Nick Fury: I sent the greatest soldier in history to make sure that didn't happen.\
Steve Rogers: Soldiers trust each other, that's what makes it an army. Not a bunch of guys running around and shooting guns.\
Nick Fury: The last time I trusted someone, I lost an eye. Look, I didn't want you doing anything you weren't comfortable with. Agent Romanoff is comfortable with everything.\
Steve Rogers: I can't lead a mission when the people I'm leading have missions of their owns.\
Nick Fury: It's called compartmentalization. Nobody spills the secrets because nobody knows them all.\
Steve Rogers: Except you.\
Nick Fury: You're wrong about me. I do share. I'm nice like that.\
[Fury steps into an elevator with Steve following behind him]\
Nick Fury: Insight bay.\
SHIELD Computer: Captain Rogers does not have clearance for Project Insight.\
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\
[the elevator starts moving down]\
Steve Rogers: You know, they used to play music.\
Nick Fury: Yeah. My grandfather operated one of these things for forty years. My granddad worked in a nice building, he got good tips.\
[Nick looks up]\
Nick Fury:He'd walk home every night, roll of ones stuffed in his lunch bag. He'd say "hi", people would say hi back. Time went on, neighborhood got rougher. He'd say "Hi", they'd say, "Keep on steppin'. Granddad got to grippin' that lunch bag a little tighter.\
Steve Rogers: Did he ever get mugged?\
Nick Fury: Every week some punk would say, "What's in the bag?"\
Steve Rogers: What did he do?\
Nick Fury: He'd show 'em. Bunch of crumpled ones and loaded .22 Magnum.\
[Fury smiles]\
Nick Fury: Granddad loved people. But he didn't trust them very much.\
[as they continue to ride down the elevator Steve notices the giant Helicarriers]\
Nick Fury: Yeah, I know. They're a little bit bigger than a .22.\
[as Fury shows Steve round]\
Nick Fury: This is Project Insight. Three next generation Helicarriers synced to a network of targeting satellites.\
Steve Rogers: Launched from the Lemurian Star.\
Nick Fury: Once we get them in the air they never need to come down. Continuous suborbital flight courtesy of our new repulsor engines.\
Steve Rogers: Stark?\
Nick Fury: Well, he had a few suggestions once he got an up close look at our old turbines. These new long range precision guns can eliminate a thousand hostiles a minute. The satellites can read a terrorist's DNA before he steps outside his spider hole. We gonna neutralize a lot of threats before they even happen.\
Steve Rogers: I thought the punishment usually came after the crime.\
Nick Fury: We can't afford to wait that long.\
Steve Rogers: Who's "we"?\
Nick Fury: After New York, I convinced the World Security Council we needed a quantum surge in threat analysis. For once we're way ahead of the curve.\
Steve Rogers: By holding a gun at everyone on Earth and calling it protection.\
Nick Fury: You know, I read those SSR files. Greatest generation? You guys did some nasty stuff.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear.\
Nick Fury: SHIELD takes the world as it is, not as we'd like it to be. It's getting damn near past time for you to get with that program, Cap.\
Steve Rogers: Don't hold your breath.\
[Steve turns and walks off]\
[Steve takes off on his motorcycle; in the Smithsonian Museum there is an exhibit dedicated to Captain America]\
The Smithsonian Narrator: A symbol to the nation. A hero to the world. The story of Captain America is one of honor, bravery and sacrifice.\
[Steve, keeping his face hidden under a baseball cap, walks over to the exhibition]\
Woman on PA: (faintly) Welcome to the Smithsonian. Visitor information booths are available on the second level.\
The Smithsonian Narrator: Denied enlistment due to poor health, Steven Rogers was chosen for a program unique in the annals of American warfare. One that would transform him into the world's first super soldier.\
[a boy recognizes him, Steve smiles puts his finger against his mouth to indicate for the boy to keep quiet and the boy nods, Steve then watches some old footage of himself]\
Old Footage Recording: In this rare footage, everyone's favorite war hero, Captain America...\
[Steve goes to the display where there are mannequins with costumes of Steve's old commando squad]\
The Smithsonian Narrator: Battle tested, Captain America and his Howling Commandos quickly earned their stripes. Their mission, taking down HYDRA, the Nazi rogue science division.\
[Steve walks over to the a display of his friend Bucky Barnes]\
The Smithsonian Narrator: Best friends since childhood, Bucky Barnes and Steven Rogers were inseparable on both schoolyard and battlefield. Barnes is the only Howling Commando to give his life in service of his country.\
[Steve watches an older looking Peggy Carter being interviewed]\
Peggy Carter: That was a difficult winter. A blizzard had trapped half our battalion behind the German line. Steve...\
(Peggy hesitates)\
Peggy Carter: Captain Rogers, he fought his way through a HYDRA blockade that had pinned our allies down for months. He saved over a thousand men, including the man who would...who would become my husband as it turned out. Even after he died, Steve was still changing my life.\
[Steve looks at the photo of Peggy he'd kept in his old compass]\
[Steve visits Peggy, who is now lying sick in bed]\
Steve Rogers: You should be proud of yourself, Peggy.\
[Steve looks at Peggy's family photos by her bedside table showing her with her husband and children]\
Peggy Carter: Mm. I have lived a life. My only regret is that you didn't get to live yours.\
[Steve looks sad]\
Peggy Carter: What is it?\
Steve Rogers: For as long as I can remember I just wanted to do what was right. I guess I'm not quite sure what that is anymore. And I thought I could throw myself back in and follow orders, serve. It's just not the same.\
[Peggy chuckles]\
Peggy Carter: You're always so dramatic. Look, you saved the world. We rather...mucked it up.\
Steve Rogers: You didn't. Knowing that you helped found SHIELD is half the reason I stay.\
[Peggy takes Steve's hand]\
Peggy Carter: Hey. The world has changed and none of us can go back. All we can do is our best, and sometimes the best that we can do is to start over.\
[Peggy starts to cough, Steve turns to get her some water and goes to hand it to her]\
Steve Rogers: Peggy.\
[suddenly Peggy looks at Steve like she's seeing for the first time since he was frozen]\
Peggy Carter: Steve?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah.\
Peggy Carter: You're alive! You...you came, you came back.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, Peggy.\
[Peggy begins to cry]\
Peggy Carter: It's been so long. So long.\
Steve Rogers: Well, I couldn't leave my best girl. Not when she owes me a dance.\
[Fury is alone in his office; to his voice controlled computer]\
Nick Fury: Secure office.\
[all the windows are blackened, Fury takes out the flash drive Natasha had downloaded all the files from the the Lemurian Star and places it in his computer]\
Nick Fury: Open Lemurian Star's satellite launch file.\
SHIELD Computer: Access denied.\
Nick Fury: Run decryption.\
SHIELD Computer: Decryption failed.\
Nick Fury: Director override, Fury, Nicholas J.\
SHIELD Computer: Override denied. All files sealed.\
Nick Fury: On whose authority?\
SHIELD Computer: Fury, Nicholas J.\
[Fury looks confused and worried]\
[Fury enters elevator]\
Nick Fury: World Security Council.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\
[Alexander Pierce is holding a virtual meeting with the World Security Council]\
Councilman Rockwell: If Nick Fury thinks he can get his costumed thugs and STRIKE commandos to mop-up his mess, he's sadly mistaken. This failure is unacceptable.\
Councilman Singh: Well, considering this attack took place one mile from my country's sovereign waters, it's a bit more then that. I move for immediate hearing.\
Councilwoman Hawley: We don't need hearings, we need action. It's this Council's duty to oversee SHIELD.\
Councilman Yen: A breach like this raises serious questions.\
Councilman Rockwell: Like how the hell did a French pirate manage to hijack a covert SHIELD vessel in broad daylight?\
Alexander Pierce: For the record, councilman, he's Algerian. I can draw a map if it'll help.\
Councilman Rockwell: I appreciate your wit, Secretary Pierce. But this Council take things like international piracy fairly seriously.\
Alexander Pierce: Really? I don't. I don't care about one boat, I care about the fleet. If this Council is going to fall a rancor every time someone pushes us on the playing field, maybe we need someone to oversee us.\
Councilman Yen: Mr. Secretary, nobody is suggesting...\
[they are interrupted by Pierce's assistant walking in and whispering something to Pierce; to the council]\
Alexander Pierce: Excuse me.\
Councilman Rockwell: More trouble, Mr. Secretary?\
Alexander Pierce: It depends on your definition.\
[the meeting ends as Pierce leaves]\
Alexander Pierce: I work forty floors away and it takes a hijacking for you to visit?\
Nick Fury: A nuclear war would do it too.\
[they shake hands; referring to Pierce's meeting with the World Security Council]\
Nick Fury: Busy in there?\
Alexander Pierce: Nothing some earmarks can't fix.\
Nick Fury: I'm, uh...here to ask a favor. I want you to call for a vote. Project insight has to be delayed.\
Alexander Pierce: Nick, that's not a favor, that's a subcommittee hearing. A long one.\
Nick Fury: It could be nothing, probably is nothing. I just need time to make sure it's nothing.\
Alexander Pierce: What if it's something?\
Nick Fury: Then we'll both be damn glad those Helicarriers aren't in the air.\
[Pierce hesitates a moment before replying]\
Alexander Pierce: Fine. But you gotta get Iron Man to stop by my niece's birthday party.\
[Nick shakes his hand]\
Nick Fury: Thank you, sir.\
Alexander Pierce: And not just a flyby, he's got to mingle.\
[Pierce turns and leaves]\
[Steve goes to a PTSD group meeting where Sam is counseling other veterans]\
Female War Veteran: The thing is I think it's getting worse. A cop pulled me over last week, he thought I was drunk. I swerved to miss a plastic bag. I thought it was an IED.\
Sam Wilson: Some stuff you leave there, other stuff you bring back. It's our job to figure out how to carry it. Is it gonna be in a big suitcase or in a little man-purse? It's up to you.\
[after the meeting ends Steve waits for Sam as he finishes saying goodbye to the veterans]\
Female War Veteran: I'll see you next week.\
Sam Wilson: Yeah.\
Female War Veteran: Yeah. [Sam walks over to Steve]\
Sam Wilson: Look who it is. The running man.\
Steve Rogers: Caught the last few minutes. It's pretty intense.\
Sam Wilson: Yeah, brother, we all got the same problems. Guilt, regret.\
Steve Rogers: You lose someone?\
Sam Wilson: My wingman, Riley. Flying a night mission.Standard PJ rescue op, nothing we hadn't done a thousand times before, till RPG knock Riley's dumb ass out of the sky. Nothing I could do. It's like I was up there just to watch.\
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry.\
Sam Wilson: After that, I had really hard time finding a reason for being over there, you know?\
Steve Rogers: But you're happy now, back in the world?\
Sam Wilson: Hey, the number of people giving me orders is down to about zero. So, hell, yeah. You thinking about getting out?\
Steve Rogers: No. I don't know. To be honest, I don't know what I would do with myself if I did.\
Sam Wilson: Ultimate fighting? [Steve laughs] It's just a great idea off the top of my head. But seriously, you could do whatever you want to do. What makes you happy?\
Steve Rogers: I don't know.\
[as Fury drives through the city he instructs his car computer to make a call]\
Fury's Car: Activating communications encryption protocol.\
Nick Fury: Open secure line zero-four-zero-five.\
Fury's Car: Confirmed.\
Maria Hill: This is Hill.\
Nick Fury: I need you here in D.C. Deep shadow conditions.\
Maria Hill: Give me four hours.\
Nick Fury: You have three, over. [Fury stops at a red traffic light, he looks over to the next car and sees the two police officers in the car look at him with suspicion] Want to see my lease? [the policemen quickly sound their police horn once before they start to drive off, as Fury goes to drive off suddenly another police car smashes into his car, his car is then surrounded by several other police cars crashing into him; inside his car Fury is injured]\
Fury's Car: Fracture detected. Recommend anesthetic injection. [as Fury is giving himself the injection a SWAT team truck pulls up] D.C. Metro Police dispatch shows no units in this area. [Fury is surrounded by the police and SWAT team, he quickly realizes they are all disguised mercenaries; to his car computer]\
Nick Fury: Get me out of here! [the mercenaries suddenly start shooting at Fury's car]\
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems offline.\
Nick Fury: Then reboot, dammit! [the armor on Fury's vehicle starts to become weaker, the mercenaries bring out a battering ram to break in]\
Fury's Car: Warning! Window integrity compromised.\
Nick Fury: You think? How long to propulsion?\
Fury's Car: Calculating. [the mercenaries start to use the battering ram on Fury's car window] Window Integrity thiry-one percent. Deploying countermeasures.\
Nick Fury: Hold that order! [the batterring ram is smashed against the car window again]\
Fury's Car: Window Integrity nineteen percent. Offensive measures advised.\
Nick Fury: Wait! [the battering ram is smashed against the window again]\
Fury's Car: Window Integrity one percent.\
Nick Fury: Now! [suddenly a minigun pulls up from inside the car and Fury uses it to return fire on the mercenaries causing the SWAT truck and some of the police cars to explode]\
Fury's Car: Propulsion systems now online.\
Nick Fury: Full acceleration, now! [as he continues to fire at the mercenaries Fury's car automatically backs up and drives off] Initiate vertical takeoff!\
Fury's Car: Flight systems damaged.\
Nick Fury: Then activate guidance cameras! [Fury goes over into the drivers seat] Give me the wheel! [Fury takes over driving his car as the mercenaries chase after him in their police cars] Get me Agent Hill.\
Fury's Car: Communications array damaged.\
Nick Fury: Well, what's not damaged?\
Fury's Car: Air conditioning is fully operational. [the police cars continue to chase after Fury as he weaves through the cars on the road] Traffic ahead.\
Nick Fury: Give me an alternate route.\
Fury's Car: Traffic alert on Roosevelt Bridge. All vehicles stopped. 17th Avenue clear in three blocks, directly ahead. [as Fury heads into the traffic he smashes into some cars causing a pile up which stops the police cars, the mercenaries get out and start shooting at Fury's car, Fury manages to kill two of the mercenaries by running them down before getting past the traffic, but the remaining mercenaries continue to chase after him and manage to sandwich Fury's vehicle between them] Warning, approaching intersection. [as they approach the intersection Fury manages to shake off the two police cars, killing off the mercenaries]\
Nick Fury: Get me off the grid!\
Fury's Car: Calculating route to secure location. [Fury sees a mysterious figure emerge ahead which suddenly shoots a bomb that attaches itself to Fury's vehicle causing it to explode and flip over; trapped inside his car, Fury watches as the figure walks over to the car but he manages to escape just in time by using a laser weapon to burn a hole out.]\
[As Steve is walking to his apartment his hears his pretty neighbor talking on the phone as she goes to do her laundry]\
Sharon Carter: That's so sweet. That is so nice. Hey. I gotta go, though. Okay, bye. [turning to Steve] My aunt, she's kind of an insomniac. [Steve smiles at her] Yeah.\
Steve Rogers: Hey, if you want...if you want, you're welcome to use my machine. Might be cheaper than the one in the basement.\
Sharon Carter: Oh, yeah? What's it cost?\
Steve Rogers: A cup of coffee?\
Sharon Carter: Thank you, but um...I already have a load in downstairs, and, uh...you really don't want my scrubs in your machine. I'm just finished orientation in the infectious diseases ward, so.\
Steve Rogers: Ah, well, I'll keep my distance.\
Sharon Carter: Well hopefully not too far. [Steve nods and turns to go into his apartment] Oh, and I think you left your stereo on.\
Steve Rogers: Oh. Right, thank you.\
Sharon Carter: Yeah. [Steve watches her go down the stairs before turning in suspicion to his door]\
[Steve hears music as he cautiously enters his apartment though the window, he grabs his shield for protection and finds Fury sitting on his couch in the dark]\
Steve Rogers: I don't remember giving you a key.\
Nick Fury: You really think I'd need one? My wife kicked me out.\
Steve Rogers: Didn't know you were married.\
Nick Fury: A lot of things you don't about me.\
Steve Rogers: I know, Nick. That's the problem. [as Steve turns on the light he notices Fury's injuries for the first time, but Fury indicates for him to be silent, he turns off the light and writes something on his phone and shows it to Steve; "ears everywhere"]\
Nick Fury: I'm sorry to have to do this, but I had no place else to crash. [he writes another text and shows it to Steve; "SHIELD compromised"]\
Steve Rogers: Who else knows about your wife? [Fury shows him another text; "You and me"]\
Nick Fury: Just...my friends.\
Steve Rogers: Is that what we are?\
Nick Fury: That's up to you. [suddenly Fury is shot three times from through the wall and collapses, Steve looks out the window for the shooter then he quickly drags Fury to the next room, before he leaves Fury hands him the flash drive] Don't...trust anyone. [Fury passes out] [Steve hears someone breaking into his apartment and hears his neighbor calling out to him]\
Sharon Carter: Captain Rogers? [Steve sees her walking in with her gun pointed] Captain, I'm Agent 13 of SHIELD Special Service.\
Steve Rogers: Kate?\
Sharon Carter: I'm assigned to protect you.\
Steve Rogers: On whose order? [She notices Fury lying injured on the ground]\
Sharon Carter: His. [she goes to Fury then contacts SHIELD through her radio] Foxtrot is down, he's unresponsive. I need EMTs.\
SHIELD Agent: Do you have a twenty on the shooter? [Steve notices the shooter though the window]\
Steve Rogers: Tell him I'm in pursuit. [Steve smashes through his window and runs after the assassin, who is the same mysterious man that had exploded Fury's car, Steve chases him through an office building smashing through the walls, when he finally catches up with him on the roof he throws his shield at the assassin, but he catches it with one swift move, then throws it back to Steve and then jumps down the building and disappears.]\
[Natasha goes to the hospital and meets up with Steve, they watch doctors operating on Fury]\
Natasha Romanoff: Is he gonna make it?\
Steve Rogers: I don't know.\
Natasha Romanoff: Tell me about the shooter.\
Steve Rogers: He's fast and strong. Had a metal arm. [just then Agent Maria Hill also joins them]\
Natasha Romanoff: Ballistics?\
Maria Hill: Three slugs, no rifling. Completely untraceable.\
Natasha Romanoff: Soviet-made.\
Maria Hill: Yeah. [suddenly they watch in shock as Fury's state deteriorates]\
Male Nurse: He's in V-tach.\
Female Nurse: Crash cart coming in.\
Doctor: Nurse, help me with the drape.\
Male Nurse: BP is dropping.\
Doctor: Defibrillator! [Steve, Natasha and Hill watch in shock as Fury is flatlining] I want you to charge him at one hundred.\
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick.\
Doctor: Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given a shock with the defibrillator] Pulse?\
Male Nurse: No pulse.\
Doctor #1: No pulse.\
Doctor: Okay. 200, please. Stand back! Three, two, one. Clear! [Fury is given another shock] Give me epinephrine! Pulse?\
Male Nurse: Negative.\
Natasha Romanoff: Don't do this to me, Nick. Don't do this to me. [the three watch the doctors as they continue to revive Fury but Fury is still showing as flatlining, Steve turns away as they finally call his time of death]\
Doctor: What's the time?\
Female Nurse: 1:03, Doctor.\
Doctor: Time of death, 1:03 a.m. [Steve looks down at the flash drive Fury had given him]\
[Natasha and Steve are in a room where Fury's dead body has been laid out, Natasha is looking at Fury's body with tears running down her face, Hill joins them]\
Maria Hill: I need to take him. [Steve goes over to Natasha]\
Steve Rogers: Natasha. [she doesn't respond, instead she tenderly touches Fury's head then turns and walks out, Steve follows her] Natasha!\
Natasha Romanoff: Why was Fury in your apartment?\
Steve Rogers: I don't know. [they are interrupted by Rumlow]\
Brock Rumlow: Cap, they want you back at SHIELD.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, give me a second.\
Brock Rumlow: They want you now.\
Steve Rogers: Okay. [Steven turns to Natasha]\
Natasha Romanoff: You're a terrible liar. [she turns and walks off]\
Jasper Sitwell: [on earpiece] STRIKE team, escort Captain Rogers back to SHIELD immediately for questioning.\
Brock Rumlow: I told him. [Steve notices the vending machine next to him, we then see Steve walking towards Rumlow]\
Steve Rogers: Let's go.\
Brock Rumlow: Yeah. [to the agents] STRIKE, move it out. [as they leave we see that Steve has hid the flash drive behind a pack of gums in the vending machine]\
[back at SHIELD, Steve is brought to Pierce who is talking to Agent 13]\
Alexander Pierce: For whatever it's worth, you did your best.\
Sharon Carter: Thank you, sir. [as she turns to leave she sees Steve] Captain Rogers. [Steve replies coldly as he walks towards Pierce]\
Steve Rogers: Neighbor.\
Alexander Pierce: Ah, Captain. I'm Alexander Pierce.\
Steve Rogers: Sir, it's an honor. [they shake hands]\
Alexander Pierce: The honor is mine, Captain. My father served in the 101st. Come on in. [they enter Pierce's office where he shows Steve an old photo of Fury with Pierce] That photo was taken five years after Nick and I met. When I was at State Department in Bogota. ELN rebels took the embassy, and security got me out, but the rebels took hostages. Nick was deputy chief for the SHIELD station there. And he comes to me with a plan. He wants to storm the building through the sewers. I said, "No, we'll negotiate." Turned out the ELN didn't negotiate, so they put out a kill order. They stormed the basement, and what did they find? They find it empty. Nick had ignored my direct order and carried out an unauthorized military operation on foreign soil. He saved the lives of a dozen political officers, including my daughter.\
Steve Rogers: So you gave him a promotion.\
Alexander Pierce: I've never had any cause to regret it. Captain, why was Nick in your apartment last night?\
Steve Rogers: I don't know.\
Alexander Pierce: You know it was bugged?\
Steve Rogers: I did, because Nick told me.\
Alexander Pierce: Did he tell you he was the one who bugged it? [Steve doesn't reply obviously not knowing this information] I want you to see something. [he brings up footage of Batroc being interrogated]\
SHIELD Agent: Who hired you, Batroc?\
Steve Rogers: Is that live?\
Alexander Pierce: Yeah, they picked him up last night in a not-so-safe house in Algiers.\
Steve Rogers: Are you saying he's a suspect? Assassination isn't Batroc's line.\
Alexander Pierce: No, it's more complicated than that. Batroc was hired anonymously to attack the Lemurian Star and he was contacted by e-mail and paid by wire transfer. And then the money was run through seventeen fictitious accounts, the last one going to a holding company that was registered to a Jacob Veech.\
Steve Rogers: Am I supposed to know who that is? [he hands Steve the file]\
Alexander Pierce: Not likely. Veech died six years ago. His last address was 14-35 Elmhurst Drive. When I first met Nick his mother lived at 14-37.\
Steve Rogers: Are you saying Fury hired the pirates? Why?\
Alexander Pierce: The prevailing theory was that the hijacking was a cover for the acquisition and sale of classified intelligence. The sale went sour and that led to Nick's death.\
Steve Rogers: If you really knew Nick Fury you'd know that's not true.\
Alexander Pierce: Why do you think we're talking? See, I took a seat on the Council not because I wanted to but because Nick asked me to, because we were both realists. We knew that despite all the diplomacy and the handshaking and the rhetoric, that to build a really better world sometimes means having to tear the old one down. And that makes enemies. Those people that call you dirty because you got the guts to stick your hands in the mud and try to build something better. And the idea that those people could be happy today, makes me really, really angry. [he hesitates a moment] Captain, you were the last one to see Nick alive. I don't think that's an accident, and I don't think you do either. So I'm gonna ask again, why was he there?\
Steve Rogers: He told me not to trust anyone.\
Alexander Pierce: I wonder if that included him. [Steve pauses a moment before replying]\
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry. Those were his last words. Excuse me. [Steve picks up his shield, places it on his back and starts to make his out of the office]\
Alexander Pierce: Captain. [Steve stops and looks at Pierce] Somebody murdered my friend and I'm gonna find out why. Anyone gets in my way, they're gonna regret it. Anyone.\
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Steve turns and leaves]\
Steve Rogers: [after he leaves Pierce's office he steps into the elevator] Operations control.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [just as the elevator doors are about to close Rumlow steps in with two STRIKE agents]\
Brock Rumlow: Keep all STRIKE personnel on site.\
STRIKE Agent #1: Understood.\
STRIKE Agent #2: Yes, sir.\
Brock Rumlow: Forensics.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\
Brock Rumlow: Cap.\
Steve Rogers: Rumlow. [the elevator doors close and they start riding down]\
Brock Rumlow: Evidence Response found some fibres on the roof they want us to see. You want me to get the tac-team ready?\
Steve Rogers: No, lets wait and see what it is first.\
Brock Rumlow: Right. [Steve notices one of the agents touching his weapon suspiciously] [the elevator stops and more SHIELD and STRIKE agents enter]\
SHIELD Agent #1: What's the status so far?\
SHIELD Agent #2: Administrations level.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed.\
SHIELD Agent #2: [to Steve] Excuse me.\
Brock Rumlow: [to Steve] I'm sorry about what happened with Fury. Messed up, what happened to him.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [feeling something is off, Steve looks at the agents in the elevator and notices one of them is sweating, then the elevator stops and more agents enter]\
STRIKE Agent #3: Records.\
SHIELD Computer: Confirmed. [as the elevator doors close Steve realizes he's been surrounded by agents]\
Steve Rogers: Before we get started, does anyone want to get out? [there's a moment's pause before suddenly one of the agents turns and uses an electric rod to give Steve a shock, the others grab him and try to strap his wrists with magnetic cuffs, Steve manages to knock some of them down but one cuff remains, then Rumlow uses his rod to give Steve a shock] [as Steve is being attacked we see Sitwell in a controls room watching them from a monitor]\
Jasper Sitwell: Mobilize STRIKE units, 25th floor. [Steve manages free himself from the magnetic cuff and knock all the agents down, he turns to Rumlow]\
Brock Rumlow: Whoa, big guy. I just want you to know, Cap, this ain't personal. [Rumlow then goes to attack Steve with his electric rod but Steve manages to defend himself and eventually knocks Rumlow out]\
Steve Rogers: It kind of feels personal. [Steve picks up his shield then opens the elevator doors, but he's faced by a team of STRIKE agents pointing their weapons at him]\
25th Floor STRIKE Agent: Drop the shield! Put your hands in the air! [Steve uses his shield to break off the elevator wires which sends the elevator down, as he forces the doors open he sees more STRIKE agents approaching him, he closes the door and looks for a way out]\
STRIKE Agent: Give it up, Rogers! Get that door open! You have nowhere to go! [Steve breaks through the glass in the elevator and plummets down to finally hit the ground floor, from his monitor Sitwell watches in shock as Steve gets up and starts running off]\
Jasper Sitwell: Are you kidding me? [ordering the STRIKE team] He's headed for the garage. Lock down the bridge! [Steve rides out of the SHIELD garage on his motorcycle, evading the obstacles laid out but then a Quinjet emerges ahead of him]\
Quinjet Pilot: Stand down, Captain Rogers. Stand down. [the Quinjet lowers its machine gun] Repeat, stand down. [as Steve doesn't stop they start shooting at him, Steve throws his shield into the propellers to jam it, giving him an opportunity to hop onto it and do more damage to the jet with his shield before jumping off as the jet goes crashing down and he escapes]\
Jasper Sitwell: [to the SHIELD agents] Eyes here. [everyone, including Agent 13, looks at Sitwell] Whatever your op is, bury it. This is Level One. Contact DOT. All traffic lights in the district go red. Shut all runways at BWI, IAD and Reagan. All security cameras in the city go through this monitor, right here. Scan all open sources. Phones, computers, PDAs, whatever. If someone tweets about this guy, I want to know about it.\
Sharon Carter: With all due respect, If SHIELD is conducting a manhunt for Captain America, we deserve to know why.\
Alexander Pierce: Because he lied to us. [Pierce enters the room] Captain Rogers has information regarding the death of Director Fury, he refused to share it. As difficult as this is to accept, Captain America is a fugitive from SHIELD.\
[disguised as a civilian dressed in a hoody, Steve goes back to the hospital to retrieve the flash drive from the vending machine but sees it's gone, then Natasha appears behind him chewing some gum, in anger Steve pushes her into a room]\
Steve Rogers: Where is it?\
Natasha Romanoff: Safe.\
Steve Rogers: Do better!\
Natasha Romanoff: Where did you get it?\
Steve Rogers: Why would I tell you?\
Natasha Romanoff: Fury gave it to you. Why?\
Steve Rogers: What's on it?\
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know.\
Steve Rogers: Stop lying!\
Natasha Romanoff: I only act like I know everything, Rogers.\
Steve Rogers: I bet you knew Fury hired the pirates, didn't you?\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, it makes sense. The ship was dirty, Fury needed a way in, so do you.\
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna ask you again.\
Natasha Romanoff: I know who killed Fury. Most of the intelligence community doesn't believe he exists, the ones who do call him the Winter Soldier. He's credited with over two dozen assassinations in the last fifty years.\
Steve Rogers: So he's a ghost story.\
Natasha Romanoff: Five years ago I was escorting a nuclear engineer out of Iran, somebody shot out my tires near Odessa. We lost control, went straight over a cliff, I pulled us out, but the Winter Soldier was there. I was covering my engineer, so he shot him straight through me. [she pulls up her shirt to show him the scar on the side of her stomach] Soviet slug, no rifling. Bye-bye bikinis.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I bet you look terrible in them now. [there's a hit of a smile from Natasha]\
Natasha Romanoff: Going after him is a dead end. I know, I've tried. [Natasha holds up the flash drive] Like you said, he's a ghost story. [Steve takes the flash drive from her]\
Steve Rogers: Well, let's find out what the ghost wants.\
[Pierce is holding another virtual meeting with the World Security Council]\
Alexander Pierce: Nick Fury was murdered in cold blood. To any reasonable person, that would make him a martyr, not a traitor.\
Councilman Rockwell: You know what makes him a traitor? Hiring a mercenary to hijack his own ship.\
Councilman Singh: Nick Fury used your friendship to coerce this council into delaying Project Insight. A project he knew would expose his own illegal operations. At best, he lied to you. At worst...\
Alexander Pierce: Are you calling for my resignation? I've got a pen and paper right here.\
Councilwoman Hawley: That discussion can be tabled for a later time.\
Alexander Pierce: But you do want to have a discussion.\
Councilman Rockwell: We've already had it, Mr. Secretary. This council moves to immediately reactivate Project Insight. If you want to say something snappy, now would be a good time.\
[Steve and Natasha go to the mall disguised as a civilian couple]\
Natasha Romanoff: First rule of going on the run is, don't run, walk.\
Steve Rogers: If I run in these shoes, they're gonna fall off. [they go to a Mac store to use one of their computers]\
Natasha Romanoff: The drive has a Level Six homing program, so as soon as we boot up SHIELD will know exactly where we are.\
Steve Rogers: How much time do we have?\
Natasha Romanoff: Uh...about nine minutes from... [she pops the flash drive into a MacBook Pro] Now. [we see several SHIELD vehicles heading their way] Fury was right about that ship, somebody's trying to hide something. This drive is protected by some sort of AI, it keeps rewriting itself to counter my commands.\
Steve Rogers: Can you override it?\
Natasha Romanoff: The person who developed this is slightly smarter than me. Slightly. [Rumlow and his team pull up outside the mall and head inside] [back at the Mac store, Steve and Natasha continue to try and find out what's on the flash drive] I'm gonna try running a tracer. This is a program that SHIELD developed to track hostile malware, so if we can't read the file, maybe we can find out where it came from.\
Apple Employee: Can I help you guys with anything?\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no. My fianc\'e9 was just helping me with some honeymoon destinations.\
Steve Rogers: Right! We're getting married.\
Apple Employee: Congratulations. Where do you guys thinking about going? [Steve looks at the monitor and sees the signal traced to somewhere in New Jersey]\
Steve Rogers: New Jersey.\
Apple Employee: Oh. [the employee looks at Steve for a moment] I have the exact same glasses.\
Natasha Romanoff: Wow, you two are practically twins.\
Apple Employee: Yeah, I wish. Specimen. Uh...if you guys need anything, I've been Aaron.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you. [as Rumlow and his team are in the mall looking for Steve and Natasha] You said nine minutes, come on.\
Natasha Romanoff: Shh, relax. Got it. [they find the signal is coming from Wheaton, NJ] You know it?\
Steve Rogers: I used to. Let's go. [Steve pulls the flash drive from the computer and they walk out of the store] Standard tac-team. Two behind, to across, two coming straight at us. If they make us, I'll engage, you hit the south escalator to the metro. [as two agents are coming straight towards them]\
Natasha Romanoff: Shut up and put your arm around me, laugh at something I said.\
Steve Rogers: What?\
Natasha Romanoff: Do it! [Steve quickly puts his arm around Natasha and laughs] [inside the Mac store one of the agents looks around]\
Jack Rollins: Negative at the source.\
Brock Rumlow: Give me a floor rundown.\
SHIELD Agent #2: Negative on three.\
SHIELD Agent #3: Negative on two.\
Brock Rumlow: Snake the upper levels, work down to me. [as they are going down the escalator Natasha spots Rumlow on the escalator next to them going up, she turns to Steve]\
Natasha Romanoff: Kiss me.\
Steve Rogers: What?\
Natasha Romanoff: Public displays of affection make people very uncomfortable.\
Steve Rogers: Yes, they do. [she quickly pulls down Steve's head and kisses him making Rumlow look away as he goes past them on the escalator]\
Natasha Romanoff: You still uncomfortable?\
Steve Rogers: It's not exactly the word I would use.\
[as they drive to New Jersey]\
Natasha Romanoff: Where did Captain America learn how to steal a car?\
Steve Rogers: Nazi Germany.\
Natasha Romanoff: Mm.\
Steve Rogers: And we're borrowing. Take your feet off the dash. [Natasha takes her feet off the dash]\
Natasha Romanoff: Alright, I have a question for you, oh, which you do not have to answer. I feel like if you don't answer it though, you're kind of answering it, you know?\
Steve Rogers: What?\
Natasha Romanoff: Was that your first kiss since 1945?\
Steve Rogers: That bad, huh?\
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say that.\
Steve Rogers: Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.\
Natasha Romanoff: No, I didn't. I just wondered how much practice you've had.\
Steve Rogers: You don't need practice.\
Natasha Romanoff: Everybody needs practice.\
Steve Rogers: It was not my first kiss since 1945. I'm ninety-five, I'm not dead.\
Natasha Romanoff: Nobody special, though? [Steve chuckles]\
Steve Rogers: Believe it or not, it's kind of hard to find someone with shared life experience.\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, that's alright, you just make something up.\
Steve Rogers: What, like you?\
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know. The truth is a matter of circumstances, it's not all things to all people all the time. And neither am I.\
Steve Rogers: That's a tough way to live.\
Natasha Romanoff: It's a good way not to die, though.\
Steve Rogers: You know, it's kind of hard to trust someone when you don't know who that someone really is.\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah. Who do you want me to be?\
Steve Rogers: How about a friend? [Natasha laughs softly]\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, there's a chance you might be in the wrong business, Rogers.\
[the two pull up to outside an abandoned military base where the signal led them to]\
Steve Rogers: This is it.\
Natasha Romanoff: The file came from these coordinates.\
Steve Rogers: So did I. [later that night as they walk around the base trying to pinpoint where the signal came from] This camp is where I was trained.\
Natasha Romanoff: Changed much?\
Steve Rogers: A little. [Steve has a brief visions of his former, smaller self running past him as he's getting trained with other soldiers]\
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let's go! Let's go! Double time! Come on Rogers, move it! [his former self stops and stares at Steve as he is now] Come on! Fall in! Rogers! I said fall in! [present Steve watches nostalgically as the former Steve runs off]\
Natasha Romanoff: This is a dead end. Zero heat signature, zero waves, not even radio. Whoever wrote the file must have used a router to throw people off. [Steve notices a building ahead of them] What is it? [as they walk over to the building]\
Steve Rogers: Army regulations forbid storing ammunition within five hundred yards of the barracks. This building is in the wrong place. [Steve opens the lock with his shield and they enter inside, when they turn on the lights they notice it's a SHIELD office]\
Natasha Romanoff: This is SHIELD.\
Steve Rogers: Maybe where it started. [they enter a room where they find old framed portraits of Howard Stark, Peggy and Col. Chester Phillips]\
Natasha Romanoff: There's Stark's father.\
Steve Rogers: Howard.\
Natasha Romanoff: Who's the girl? [Steve doesn't reply and turns away to walk further down the room and stops by a massive book shelf]\
Steve Rogers: If you're already working in a secret office... [he pushes the books shelf and slides open to reveal an elevator behind it] Why do you need to hide the elevator? [they go down the elevator which takes them to a room with old looking computers]\
Natasha Romanoff: This can't be the data-point, this technology is ancient. [suddenly Natasha notices a small flash drive port, she places the flash drive in it which then activates the ancient computer in the room]\
Computer: Initiate system? [Natasha types using the keyboard]\
Natasha Romanoff: Y-E-S, spells yes. [Natasha smiles as the old computer starts to cranks up] "Shall we play a game?" [to Steve] It's from a movie that...\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I saw it. [suddenly they hear an accented voice speaking]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Rogers, Steven. Born, 1918. Romanoff, Natalia Alianovna. Born, 1984. [they see an old camera moving above them as it analyzes them]\
Natasha Romanoff: It's some kind of a recording.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am not a recording, Fr\'e4ulein. I may not be the man I was when the Captain took me prisoner in 1945, but I am. [the computer screen shows an old photo of Dr. Arnim Zola]\
Natasha Romanoff: Do you know this thing?\
Steve Rogers: Arnim Zola was a German scientist who worked for the Red Skull. He's been dead for years.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: First correction, I am Swiss. Second, look around you. I have never been more alive. In 1972 I received a terminal diagnosis. Science could not save my body, my mind, however, that was worth saving on two hundred thousand feet of data banks. You are standing in my brain.\
Steve Rogers: How did you get here?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Invited.\
Natasha Romanoff: It was Operation Paperclip after World War II. SHIELD recruited German scientists with strategic value.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: They thought I could help their cause. I also helped my own.\
Steve Rogers: HYDRA died with the Red Skull.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Cut off one head, two more shall take its place.\
Steve Rogers: Prove it.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accessing archive. [the computer screen shows them old footage of Johann Schmidt/Red Skull, of the how the original SHIELD founders] HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly. After the war, SHIELD was founded and I was recruited. The new HYDRA grew. A beautiful parasite inside SHIELD. For seventy years HYDRA has been secretly feeding crisis, reaping war. And when history did not cooperate, history was changed.\
Natasha Romanoff: That's impossible, SHIELD would have stopped you.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Accidents will happen. [the computer screen shows them HYDRA had killed Howard and Maria Stark making it look like a car accident along with the recent death of Fury] HYDRA created a world so chaotic that humanity is finally ready to sacrifice its freedom to gain its security. Once the purification process is complete, HYDRA's new world order will arise. We won, Captain. Your death amounts to the same as your Life; a zero sum. [in anger Steve suddenly smashes the computer screen] As I was saying...\
Steve Rogers: What's on this drive?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Project Insight requires insight. So I wrote an algorithm.\
Natasha Romanoff: What kind of algorithm? What does it do?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: The answer to your question is fascinating. Unfortunately, you shall be too dead to hear it. [suddenly the doors starts to close, Steve tries stops it by throwing his shield in between it but he's too late]\
Natasha Romanoff: Steve, we got a bogey. Short range ballistic. 30 seconds tops.\
Steve Rogers: Who fired it?\
Natasha Romanoff: S.H.I.E.L.D.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: I am afraid I have been stalling, Captain. Admit it, it's better this way. We're both of us...out of time. [Steve notices a small opening on the ground, he throws the metal door aside and just as the place explodes he throws himself and Natasha into the hole and protects them with his shield, he then manages to get them out from under the building rubble just as STRIKE agents arrive to roam the area for them]\
Brock Rumlow: [As he notices a footprint in the dust] Call in the asset.\
[at his home, Pierce goes to his kitchen to get a drink when he sees the Winter Soldier sat behind behind him with his gun on the table when his housekeeper calls out]\
Renata: I'm going to go, Mr. Pierce. You need anything before I leave?\
Alexander Pierce: No. Uh...it's fine, Renata, you can go home.\
Renata: Okay, night-night.\
Alexander Pierce: Good night. [Renata leaves] Want some milk? [the Winter Soldier doesn't reply] The timetable has moved. Our window is limited. Two targets, Level Six. [he pours himself a glass of milk and goes over to join the Winter Soldier at the table] They already cost me Zola. I want confirmed death in ten hours. [just then Renata interrupts them as she enters the kitchen]\
Renata: Sorry, Mr. Pierce, I...I forgot my phone. [she notices the Winter Soldier]\
Alexander Pierce: Oh, Renata. I wish you would have knocked. [Pierce picks up the gun from the table and shoots and kills her]\
[returning home from his morning run Sam hears a knock at his door, he opens the door to see Steve and Natasha]\
Sam Wilson: Hey, man.\
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry about this. We need a place to lay low.\
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone we know is trying to kill us. [Sam pauses a moment before replying]\
Sam Wilson: Not everyone. [Sam let's them enter, later as Steve and Natasha are cleaning up, Steve notices Natasha looking sad and thoughtful]\
Steve Rogers: You okay?\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.\
Steve Rogers: What's going on?\
Natasha Romanoff: When I first joined SHIELD, I thought I was going straight. But I guess I just traded in the KGB for HYDRA. I thought I knew whose lies I was telling, but...I guess I can't tell the difference anymore.\
Steve Rogers: There's a chance you might be in the wrong business. [Natasha smiles faintly]\
Natasha Romanoff: I owe you.\
Steve Rogers: It's okay.\
Natasha Romanoff: If it was the other way around, and it was down to me to save your life, and you be honest with me, would you trust me to do it?\
Steve Rogers: I would now. And I'm always honest.\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, you seem pretty chipper for someone who just found out they died for nothing.\
Steve Rogers: Well, I guess I just like to know who I'm fighting.\
Sam Wilson: [to Steve and Natasha] I made breakfast. If you guys...eat that sort of thing. [later as they are sat in Sam's kitchen]\
Natasha Romanoff: So, the question is: who in SHIELD could launch a domestic missile strike?\
Steve Rogers: Pierce.\
Natasha Romanoff: Who happens to be sitting on top of the most secure building in the world.\
Steve Rogers: But he's not working alone, Zola's algorithm was on the Lemurian Star.\
Natasha Romanoff: So was Jasper Sitwell.\
Steve Rogers: So, the real question is: how do the two most wanted people in Washington kidnap a SHIELD officer in broad daylight?\
Sam Wilson: The answer is: you don't. [Sam drops a file in front of Steve]\
Steve Rogers: What's this?\
Sam Wilson: Call it a resume. [Natasha picks up a photo of Sam with his para-rescue team]\
Natasha Romanoff: Is this Bakhmala? The Khalid Khandil mission, that was you. [to Steve] You didn't say he was a para-rescue. [looking at the photo of Sam with his colleague]\
Steve Rogers: Is this Riley?\
Sam Wilson: Yeah.\
Natasha Romanoff: I heard they couldn't bring in the choppers because of the RPGs. What did you use, a stealth chute?\
Sam Wilson: No. These. [he hands Steve the file, Steve opens it and reads it]\
Steve Rogers: I thought you said you were a pilot.\
Sam Wilson: I never said pilot.\
Steve Rogers: I can't ask you to do this, Sam. You got out for a good reason.\
Sam Wilson: Dude, Captain America needs my help. There's no better reason to get back in.\
Steve Rogers: Where can we get our hands on one of these things?\
Sam Wilson: The last one is at Fort Meade, behind three guarded gates and a twelve-inch steel wall. [Steve looks at Natasha who shrugs her shoulders]\
Steve Rogers: Shouldn't be a problem. [Steve throws down the file on the table and we see that it's a classified military project called Falcon]\
[after their meeting is over Sitwell walks out of the building with Senator Stern]\
Senator Stern: Listen, I gotta fly home tonight, cause uh...I got some constituency problem, and I gotta press the flesh.\
Jasper Sitwell: Any constituent in particular, Mr. Senator?\
Senator Stern: Uh...no, not really. Twenty-three, kind of hot. Real hot. You know, wants to be a reporter, I think. I don't know, who listens at that point?\
Jasper Sitwell: Doesn't sound much of a problem to me.\
Senator Stern: Really? Cause she's killing my back. Look, this isn't the place to talk about it. [he touches Sitwell's pin on his jacket] This is a nice pin.\
Jasper Sitwell: Thank you.\
Senator Stern: Come here. [they embrace and as they do Stern whispers to Sitwell] Hail, HYDRA. [as Stern steps away he touches his back] See, it's right there...\
Jasper Sitwell: I just saw that, yeah.\
Senator Stern: Should I get it checked?\
Jasper Sitwell: I think you should. [Stern walks away] [Sitwell gets a call from Pierce, Sitwell turns to his men] I need a minute. Bring the car around. [his men leave and Sitwell answers the phone] Yes, sir?\
Sam Wilson: Agent Sitwell, how was lunch? I hear the crab cakes here are delicious.\
Jasper Sitwell: Who is this?\
Sam Wilson: The good looking guy in the sunglasses, your ten o'clock. [Sitwell looks around but doesn't see him] Your other ten o'clock. [Sitwell turns the other way and sees Sam sitting a few feet away from him] There you go.\
Jasper Sitwell: What do you want?\
Sam Wilson: You're gonna go around the corner, to your right. There's a grey car, two spaces down. You and I are gonna take a ride.\
Jasper Sitwell: And why would I do that?\
Sam Wilson: Because that tie looks really expensive, and I'd hate to mess it up. [Sitwell looks down at his tie and sees a small red light from the gun being pointed at him] [Steve throws Sitwell across a rooftop, Natasha follows behind him]\
Steve Rogers: Tell me about Zola's algorithm.\
Jasper Sitwell: Never heard of it.\
Steve Rogers: What were you doing on the Lemurian Star?\
Jasper Sitwell: I was throwing up, I get seasick. [Steve forces Sitwell to the edge of the rooftop, Sitwell just smiles] Is this little display meant to insinuate that you're gonna throw me off the roof? Because it's really not your style, Rogers.\
Steve Rogers: You're right. It's not. It's hers. [Steve steps aside and Natasha kicks Sitwell off the roof, he plummets down screaming]\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, wait. What about that girl from accounting, Laura...?\
Steve Rogers: Lillian. Lip piercing, right?\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, she's cute.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm not ready for that. [suddenly, Sam, in his Falcon jet-pack suit with wings, flies up holding Sitwell and throws him down on the roof] [Steve and Natasha walk towards Sitwell, he holds his hand up in fear]\
Jasper Sitwell: Zola's algorithm is a program...for choosing Insight's targets!\
Steve Rogers: What targets?\
Jasper Sitwell: You! A TV anchor in Cairo, the Undersecretary of Defense, a high school valedictorian in Iowa city. Bruce Banner, Stephen Strange, anyone who's a threat to HYDRA! Now, or in the future.\
Steve Rogers: The Future? How could it know? [Sitwell laughs]\
Jasper Sitwell: How could it not? The 21st century is a digital book. Zola taught HYDRA how to read it. [Steve and Natasha look at him in confusion] Your bank records, medical histories, voting patterns, e-mails, phone calls, your damn SAT scores. Zola's algorithm evaluates people's past to predict their future.\
Steve Rogers: And what then?\
Jasper Sitwell: Oh, my God. Pierce is gonna kill me.\
Steve Rogers: What then?!\
Jasper Sitwell: Then the Insight Helicarriers scratch people off the list. A few million at a time.\
Jasper Sitwell: [as Sam drives them to Triskelion] HYDRA doesn't like leaks.\
Sam Wilson: So why don't you try sticking a cork in it.\
Natasha Romanoff: Insight's launching in sixteen hours, we're cutting it a little bit close here.\
Steve Rogers: I know. We'll use him to bypass the DNA scans and access the Helicarriers directly.\
Jasper Sitwell: What?! Are you crazy? That is a terrible, terrible idea. [suddenly the Winter Soldier lands on the car roof, pulls Sitwell out through the window and throws him into the oncoming traffic, killing him, he then starts shooting at them until Steve pulls the break handle making the Winter Soldier drop down onto the street, as another car smashes into the trio's car and pushes them along, the Winter Soldier jumps back onto their car, smashes through the windscreen and pulls out the steering wheel]\
Sam Wilson: Shit! [Natasha starts shooting at him but the Winter Soldier jumps onto the vehicle behind them, as the trio's car is being pulled off the road Steve holds on to the car door]\
Steve Rogers: Hang on! [he breaks open the door, holding onto Natasha and Sam, they slide on the car door through the streets] [the Winter Soldier is joined by HYDRA agents and they start shooting at them, the trio scatter and run off in different directions with the Winter Soldier shooting at Natasha but she manages to shoot him in his eye goggle mask and run off]\
Winter Soldier: 
\f1 \uc0\u1054 \u1085 \u1072 
\f0  
\f1 \uc0\u1091 
\f0  
\f1 \uc0\u1084 \u1077 \u1085 \u1103 
\f0 . 
\f1 \uc0\u1053 \u1072 \u1081 \u1076 \u1080 
\f0  
\f1 \uc0\u1077 \u1075 \u1086 
\f0 . (She's mine. ([subtitled as:] I'll take care of her.) Find him.) [the Winter Soldier goes in pursuit of Natasha as the Hydra agents go after Steve and Sam who both manage to fend them off as they shoot at them, Steve then notices the Winter Soldier in pursuit of Natasha]\
Sam Wilson: Go, I got this! [the Winter Soldier thinks he's found Natasha hiding behind a car as he can hear her voice]\
Natasha Romanoff: I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block of Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. Taking fire above and below expressway. Civilians threatened. Repeat, civilians threatened. [he rolls a bomb towards where he thinks she's hiding. As the bomb rolls behind the car we see that Natasha isn't actually there but a recording over her voice is being played back on a phone] I make an LZ, twenty-three hundred block at Virginia Avenue. Rendezvous two minutes. [as the bomb explodes Natasha jumps onto the Winter Soldiers back and tries to kill him but he throws her off, she starts running off as he goes after her]\
Natasha Romanoff: [to the civilians as she tries to get away from the Winter Soldier] Get out of the way! Stay out of the way! [suddenly she gets shot in the shoulder, she falls and looks around her, as the Winter Soldier comes up from behind to shoot her Steve jumps in and attacks him, they fight and in the process the Winter Soldier takes Steve's shield and throws it at him but Steve manages to avoid being hit, after battling it out more the Winter Soldier's mask comes off, as he looks around at Steve we learn the true identity of the Winter Soldier; Bucky Barnes]\
Steve Rogers: Bucky?\
Bucky Barnes: Who the hell is Bucky? [as Bucky goes to shoot at Steve Sam flies in and kicks Bucky aside, Bucky takes aim again but before he can shoot Natasha uses the grenade launcher Bucky dropped earlier to shoot at Bucky who vanishes in the smoke of the explosion, then the trio hear sirens after which they are surrounded by HYDRA agents being led by Rumlow]\
Brock Rumlow: Drop the shield, Cap! On your knees! Get on your knees! Now! Get down! Get down! [Steve holds his hands up] Get on your knees! Down! [he kicks Steve's leg and Steve kneels down] Don't move. [Rumlow looks at the helicopter flying above them and warns Rollins who's holding Steve at gunpoint] Put the gun down. Not here. Not here! [Rollins lowers his gun, the HYDRA agents then take Steve, Sam, and Natasha into custody]\
[as the trio is being escorted in a van]\
Steve Rogers: It was him. He looked right at me like he didn't even know me.\
Sam Wilson: How's that even possible? It was like seventy years ago.\
Steve Rogers: Zola. Bucky's whole unit was captured in '43, Zola experimented on him. Whatever he did helped Bucky survive the fall. They must have found him and...\
Natasha Romanoff: None of that's your fault, Steve.\
Steve Rogers: Even when I had nothing, I had Bucky. [Sam notices Natasha is bleeding from her shoulder and looks at the guards]\
Sam Wilson: We need to get a doctor here. We don't put pressure on that wound she's gonna bleed out here in the truck. [suddenly one of the guards pulls out an electric rod and neutralizes the other guard and knocks him out, the guard is revealed to be Hill as she takes off her helmet]\
Maria Hill: Ah. That thing was squeezing my brain. [Sam looks at her in confusion; to Steve] Who's this guy? [Rumlow's crew stop their vehicles and get out]\
Brock Rumlow: Three holes. Start digging. [they go over to the van holding Steve, Sam and Natasha and as they open the door they find it empty with one of the guards left unconscious and massive burnt whole on the car floor]\
[Hill has taken the trio to a secret facility, a man runs towards them; referring to Natasha's wound]\
Maria Hill: GSW. She's lost at least a pint.\
Sam Wilson: Maybe two.\
Doctor: Let me take her.\
Maria Hill: She'll want to see him first. [Hill takes them to Fury who's alive and lying in bed, the trio look at him in shock]\
Nick Fury: About damn time. [later as Natasha's wound is being treated] Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, one hell of a headache.\
Doctor: Don't forget your collapsed lung.\
Nick Fury: Oh, let's not forget that. Otherwise, I'm good.\
Natasha Romanoff: They cut you open, your heart stopped.\
Nick Fury: Tetrodotoxin B. Slows the pulse to one beat a minute. Banner developed it for stress. Didn't work so great for him, but we found a use for it.\
Steve Rogers: Why all the secrecy? Why not just tell us?\
Maria Hill: Any attempt on the director's life had to look successful.\
Nick Fury: Can't kill you if you're already dead. Besides, I wasn't sure who to trust.\
[inside a bank vault, the HYDRA agents fix Bucky's metal arm and as they do so he has a brief flashback to his old life after he was recovered by Zola and the HYDRA agents]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sergeant Barnes... [he has to flashback to falling off the train at the edge of the mountain with Steve trying to save him]\
Steve Rogers: Bucky, no! [he then has flashback to after he's picked up by Hydra agents]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: The procedure has already started. [we see the Zola and the Hydra agent amputating his left arm and replacing with the metal arm] You are to be the new fist of HYDRA. [to his men] Put him on ice. [we see Bucky being frozen after which he comes back to the present and knocks over the HYDRA agent fixing his arm, Rollins points his gun at him to stop him attacking any further] [as Pierce enters the bank vault Bucky is being held in]\
Scientist #1: Sir, he's...he's unstable. Erratic. [Pierce enters with Rumlow and some other HYDRA agents and goes over to Bucky]\
Alexander Pierce: Mission report. [Bucky; looking blank, doesn't respond] Mission report, now. [Pierce moves closer to Bucky and suddenly strikes him hard in the face]\
Bucky Barnes: The man on the bridge... [he has flashback to Steve calling him by his name] Who was he?\
Alexander Pierce: You met him earlier this week on another assignment.\
Bucky Barnes: I knew him. [Pierce sits in front of Bucky]\
Alexander Pierce: Your work has been a gift to mankind. You shaped the century, and I need you to do it one more time. Society is at a tipping point between order and chaos. Tomorrow morning we're gonna give it a push. But, if you don't do your part, I can't do mine, and HYDRA can't give the world the freedom it deserves.\
Bucky Barnes: But I knew him. [Pierce turns to the scientists]\
Alexander Pierce: Prep him.\
Scientist #1: He's been out of cryo-freeze too long.\
Alexander Pierce: Then wipe him and start over. [the scientists strap Bucky in his chair and then place a teeth shield in his mouth as they begin the process of wiping his brain with Bucky screaming in pain]\
[back at the secret facility]\
Nick Fury: [looking at a photo of Pierce] This man declined the Nobel Peace Prize. He said, "Peace wasn't an achievement, it was a responsibility." See, it's stuff like this that gives me trust issues.\
Natasha Romanoff: We have to stop the launch.\
Nick Fury: I don't think the Council's accepting my calls anymore. [Fury opens a case containing three chips]\
Sam Wilson: What's that?\
Maria Hill: Once the Helicarriers reach three thousand feet, they'll triangulate with Insight satellites becoming fully weaponized.\
Nick Fury: We need to breach those carriers and replace their targeting blades with our own.\
Maria Hill: One or two won't cut it. We need to link all three carriers for this to work, because if even one of those ships remains operational a whole lot of people are gonna die.\
Nick Fury: We have to assume everyone aboard those carriers is HYDRA. We need to get pass them, insert the server blades, and maybe, just maybe, we can salvage what's left...\
Steve Rogers: We're not salvaging anything. We're not just taking down the carriers, Nick, we're taking down SHIELD.\
Nick Fury: SHIELD had nothing to do with it.\
Steve Rogers: You gave me this mission, this is how it ends. SHIELD's been compromised, you said so yourself. HYDRA grew right under your nose and nobody noticed.\
Nick Fury: Why do you think we're meeting in this cave? I noticed.\
Steve Rogers: And how many paid the price before you did?\
Nick Fury: Look, I didn't know about Barnes.\
Steve Rogers: Even if you have, would you have told me? Or would you have compartmentalized that too? SHIELD, HYDRA, it all goes.\
Maria Hill: He's right. [Fury looks at Natasha then Sam]\
Sam Wilson: Don't look at me. I do what he does, just slower.\
Nick Fury: Well... Looks like you're giving the orders now, Captain.\
[Steve stands on a bridge and has a flashback to the time he spent with Bucky after Steve's mother's funeral]\
Bucky Barnes: We looked for you after. My folks wanted to give you a ride to the cemetery. [they walk towards Steve's apartment]\
Steve Rogers: I know, I'm sorry. I just...kind of wanted to be alone.\
Bucky Barnes: How was it?\
Steve Rogers: It was okay. She's next to Dad.\
Bucky Barnes: I was gonna ask...\
Steve Rogers: I know what you're gonna say, Buck, I just...\
Bucky Barnes: We can put the couch cushions on the floor like when we were kids. It'll be fun. All you gotta do is shine my shoes, maybe take out the trash. [as they get to the apartment door, Steve tries to find his keys, Bucky kicks a brick aside, picks up the apartment keys from under it and gives it to Steve] Come on.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Buck, but I can get by on my own.\
Bucky Barnes: The thing is, you don't have to. [Bucky gives Steve a friendly pat on the shoulder] I'm with you to the end of the line, pal.\
[Steve's thoughts of Bucky are interrupted as Sam joins him on the bridge]\
Sam Wilson: He's gonna be there, you know?\
Steve Rogers: I know.\
Sam Wilson: Look, whoever he used to be, the guy he is now, I don't think he's the kind you save. He's the kind you stop.\
Steve Rogers: I don't know if I can do that.\
Sam Wilson: Well, he might not give you a choice. He doesn't know you.\
Steve Rogers: He will. Gear up, it's time. [Steve turns and starts to walk off]\
Sam Wilson: You gonna wear that?\
Steve Rogers: No. If you're gonna fight a war, you gotta wear a uniform. [later as a guard walks in the Smithsonian Museum when he looks over to the Captain America exhibit he notices the Captain America WWII uniform on that was on the dummy has been stolen]\
Smithsonian Guard: Oh, man. I am so fired!\
[at the Triskelion where the Helicarriers are being held]\
Man on PA: We are in final launch sequence.\
SHIELD Tech: We are go on guidance.\
Woman on PA: All personnel to launch station.\
[Pierce meets the World Security Council as they arrive at the Triskelion]\
Alexander Pierce: And how was your flight?\
Councilman Hawley: Lovely. The ride from the airport less so.\
Alexander Pierce: Sadly, SHIELD can't control everything.\
Councilman Rockwell: Including Captain America. [Pierce walks over to one of the guards who hands him a case containing four pins]\
Alexander Pierce: This facility is biometrically controlled, and these will give you unrestricted access. [the council members each take a pin to wear]\
[at the Project Insight headquarters]\
Com Tech #1: I've been parking there for two months.\
Com Tech #2: But it's his spot.\
Com Tech #1: So where's he been?\
Com Tech #2: I think Afghanistan.\
Com Tech #1: [into his earpiece] Negative, DT-6. The pattern is full. [to his colleague] Well, he could have said something. [suddenly they hear a sharp noise through their earpiece] Ow!\
Com Tech #2: Must be the dish.\
Com Tech #1: I'll check it out.\
Man on PA: Triskelion command request we clear the area for launch.\
[as the Tech goes and opens the door he's faced with Steve, Sam and Hill on the other side of the door, Sam and Hill point their guns at him]\
Steve Rogers: Excuse us. [the tech holds his hands up and steps aside to let them enter]\
Alexander Pierce: [addressing the World Security Council members] I know the road hasn't exactly been smooth, and some of you would have gladly kicked me out of the car along the way. Finally we're here, and the world should be grateful. [as they start drinking to Pierce's toast suddenly they hear Steve over the SHIELD microphone that everyone in the building can hear]\
Steve Rogers: Attention, all SHIELD agents. This is Steve Rogers. You've heard a lot about me over the last few days, some of you were even ordered to hunt me down. But I think it's time you know the truth. SHIELD is not what we thought it was, it's been taken over by HYDRA. Alexander Pierce is their leader. The STRIKE and Insight crew are HYDRA as well. I don't know how many more, but I know they're in the building. They could be standing right next to you. They almost have what they want: absolute control. They shot Nick Fury and it won't end there. If you launch those Helicarriers today, HYDRA will be able to kill anyone that stands in their way, unless we stop them. I know I'm asking a lot, but the price of freedom is high, it always has been, and it's a price I'm willing to pay. And if I'm the only one, then so be it. But I'm willing to bet I'm not. [as Steve finishes his speech]\
Sam Wilson: Did you write that down first, or was it off the top of your head? [to Pierce after learning the truth about him]\
Councilman Rockwell: You smug son of a bitch.\
Councilman Singh: [to the two HYDRA agents enter the room, thinking they are SHIELD agents] Arrest him. [the HYDRA agent points his gun at Singh]\
Alexander Pierce: I guess I've got the floor.\
[Rumlow and his men break into the control room, where Agent 13 also is, Rumlow walks over to one of the techs]\
Brock Rumlow: Preempt the launch sequence. Send those ships up now. [The tech hesitates visibly.] Is there a problem?\
SHIELD Tech: I'm... [the tech shakes his head nervously]\
Brock Rumlow: Is there a problem?\
SHIELD Tech: I'm sorry, sir. [the tech takes a few nervous breaths before replying] I'm not gonna launch those ships. Captain's orders. [Rumlow points his gun at the tech's head]\
Brock Rumlow: Move away from your station. [Agent 13 walks over to Rumlow pointing her gun at him]\
Sharon Carter: Like he said! [suddenly all the SHIELD agents draw their weapons and point them at Rumlow] Captain's orders.\
Brock Rumlow: You picked the wrong side, Agent.\
Sharon Carter: Depends on where you're standing. [Rumlow drops his gun, but as he does he grabs his knife and cuts Agent 13's arm, leading to the SHIELD agents firing their guns, amidst the bullets, Rumlow manages to release the Helicarriers and runs off]\
[as the bay doors holding the Helicarriers are about to be opened]\
SHIELD Agent: Close the bay door! Close the bay door now! Close the bay door! [the HYDRA agents enter and start shooting and killing the crew and techs; at the headquarters Hill watches on the monitor as the Helicarriers are being initiated]\
Maria Hill: They're initiating launch.\
[Steve and Sam make their way to the Helicarriers]\
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, how do we know the good guys from the bad guys?\
Steve Rogers: If they're shooting at you, they're bad. [Sam, in his Falcon suit, flies off and Steve heads down, the HYDRA agents starting shooting at them, Sam flies around avoiding getting shot]\
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap, I found those bad guys you were talking about.\
Steve Rogers: You okay?\
Sam Wilson: [flying off as the HYDRA agents continue to shoot at him] I'm not dead yet.\
[Pierce watches from the window the commotion caused by Steve and Sam trying to stop the Helicarriers launching, he turns to Singh]\
Alexander Pierce: Let me ask you a question. What if Pakistan marched into Mumbai tomorrow, and you knew that they were gonna drag your daughters into a soccer stadium for execution? [Pierce hands Singh a glass of champagne] And you could just stop it with a flick of the switch. Wouldn't you? Wouldn't you all?\
Councilman Singh: Not if it was your switch. [Singh tosses the glass aside, one of the HYDRA agents hands Pierce his gun and Pierce points it at Singh, suddenly Hawley kicks Singh away, then takes down the other HYDRA agents in the room before taking the gun and pointing at Pierce, she then removes her disguise to reveal it's Natasha]\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm sorry. Did I step on your moment?\
Charlie Weapons Tech: [referring to the Helicarriers] Satellites in range at three thousand feet.\
Maria Hill: Falcon, status?\
Sam Wilson: Engaging. [Sam manages to fly down to the Hellicarrier bay taking down the HYDRA jets chasing him] Alright, Cap, I'm in. [just then another HYDRA jets heads his way and starts shooting at him] Shit! [Sam manages to fly off and avoid getting hit, meanwhile Steve is fighting off the HYDRA agents as he tries to get inside the Helicarrier]\
Maria Hill: Eight minutes, Cap.\
Steve Rogers: Working on it.\
Councilman Rockwell: [to Natasha who is on the computer] What are you doing?\
Alexander Pierce: She's disabling security protocols and dumping all the secrets onto the Internet.\
Natasha Romanoff: Including HYDRA's.\
Alexander Pierce: And SHIELD's. If you do this, non of your past is gonna remain hidden. [Natasha continues typing into the computer] Are you sure you're ready for the world to see you as you really are?\
Natasha Romanoff: Are you?\
[Control center of Helicarrier Alpha]\
Steve Rogers: Alpha locked.\
Maria Hill: Falcon, where are you now?\
Sam Wilson: I had to take a detour! [Sam is flying towards one of the Helicarriers when heat-seeking missiles are shot at him by HYDRA, so he flies back towards the Helicarrier and manages to get the missiles that were aimed at him to hit the Helicarrier giving him entrance] Oh, yeah! [Sam flies into the Helicarrier; to Hill] I'm in. Bravo locked. [Sam flies out of the carrier]\
Maria Hill: Two down, one to go.\
SHIELD Pilot: All SHIELD pilots, scramble. We're the only air support Captain Rogers has got. [suddenly Bucky appears and starts firing at the SHIELD pilots and agents killing them all after which he gets into one of the jets and flies off; back inside the building with Natasha, Pierce and the council members]\
Alexander Pierce: Disabling the encryption is an executive order, it takes two Alpha Level members.\
Natasha Romanoff: Don't worry, company's coming. [just then a helicopter appears outside, lands and Fury steps out to enter the building to Pierce's surprise]\
Alexander Pierce: Did you get my flowers? [Fury looks at him coldly] I'm glad you're here, Nick.\
Nick Fury: Really? Cause I thought you had me killed.\
Alexander Pierce: You know how the game works.\
Nick Fury: So why make me head of SHIELD?\
Alexander Pierce: Cause you were the best and the most ruthless person I ever met.\
Nick Fury: I did what I did to protect people.\
Alexander Pierce: Our enemies are your enemies, Nick. Disorder, war. It's just a matter of time before a dirty bomb goes off in Moscow, or an EMP fries Chicago. Diplomacy? Holding action, a band-aid. And you know where I learned that; Bogota. You didn't ask, you just did what had to be done. I can bring order to the lives of seven billion people by sacrificing twenty million. It's the next step, Nick, if you have the courage to take it.\
Nick Fury: No, I have the courage not to. [Fury takes Pierce to the retinal scanner with Natasha pointing her gun at him]\
SHIELD Computer: Retinal scanner active.\
Alexander Pierce: You don't you think we wiped your clearance from the system?\
Nick Fury: I know you erased my password, probably deleted my retinal scan, but if you want to stay ahead of me, Mr. Secretary... [Fury removes his eyepatch to reveal his scarred dead eye] You need to keep both eyes open. [they both look into the retinal scanner with Fury using his dead eye]\
SHIELD Computer: Alpha Level confirmed. Encryption code accepted. Safeguards removed.\
[back with Hill at the headquarters]\
Maria Hill: Charlie Carrier's forty-five degrees off the port bow. [she notices two HYDRA agents making breaking into the headquarters, she shoots and kills them as they enter] Six minutes. [Steve is trying to get away from the HYDRA agents shooting at him on the Helicarrier]\
Steve Rogers: Hey, Sam, I'm gonna need a ride.\
Sam Wilson: Roger! Let me know when you're ready. [Steve just manages to jump off the edge as a HYDRA agent shoots a missile at him]\
Steve Rogers: I just did! [Sam flies in just in time to catch Steve] [Sam flies himself and Steve onto the last Helicarrier]\
Sam Wilson: You know, you're a lot heavier than you look.\
Steve Rogers: I had a big breakfast. [suddenly Bucky appears and pushes Steve off the edge]\
Sam Wilson: Steve! [as Sam goes to fly off and help Steve Bucky grabs one of his wings and throws him back, Sam starts shooting at Bucky and as he goes to fly off Bucky uses his weapon to rip off one of Sam's wings and kicks him off the Helicarrier, Sam manages to get his parachute out and lands on the roof of the Triskelion] Cap? Cap, come in. Are you okay? [we see Steve is holding onto the side of the Helicarrier]\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I'm here! I'm still on the Helicarrier. [he pulls himself up] Where are you?\
Sam Wilson: I'm grounded, the suit's down. Sorry, Cap.\
Steve Rogers: Don't worry, I got it. [Bucky watches Steve from above the Helicarrier] [as everyone at the Triskelion is rushing around trying to evacuate the building Rumlow fights and kills some SHIELD agents]\
SHIELD Agent: All SHIELD agents regroup at Rally Point Delta. [Romlow kills the speaker and another three agents.]\
HYDRA Dispatch: [on radio] Sir, Council's been breached.\
Brock Rumlow: Repeat, dispatch.\
HYDRA Dispatch: Black Widow's up there.\
Brock Rumlow: Headed up! [Hill notices Rumlow on the monitor]\
Maria Hill: Falcon?\
Sam Wilson: Yeah?\
Maria Hill: Rumlow's headed for the Council.\
Sam Wilson: I'm on it.\
[inside the Helicarrier Steve is confronted by Bucky]\
Steve Rogers: People are gonna die, Buck. I can't let that happen. [Bucky stares at him coldly] Please, don't make me do this. [seeing Bucky won't back down Steve throws his shield at him and they start battling each other, as they fight Steve manages to bring up the targeting blade system, but as Bucky attacks him the chip falls from Steve's hand; back at the Council]\
Natasha Romanoff: Done. [she looks at her mobile device] And it's trending. [just then Pierce sets off the pins he gave the council members, causing it to burn deeply into their sternum, Natasha and Fury points their guns at Pierce; to Natasha]\
Alexander Pierce: Unless you want two inch hole in your sternum, I'd put that gun down. [Natasha doesn't back down] That was armed the moment you pinned it on. [Fury and Natasha reluctantly lower their weapons]\
[back at the Helicarrier as they are battling it out, Bucky stabs Steve in the shoulder with his knife and then grabs the fallen chip, but Steve manages to get the knife out, grab Bucky by the throat and throws him down, armlocks him.]\
Steve Rogers: Drop it! Drop it! [as Bucky continues to hold the chip, Steve breaks his arm and holds onto his throat until he passes out and lets go of the chip, Steve then grabs the chip and rushes off; back at the Triskelion]\
[An office in the SHIELD HQ]\
Brock Rumlow: I'm on forty-one, headed towards the south-west stairwell. [just then Sam attacks Rumlow but Rumlow manages to knock Sam down] This is gonna hurt. There are no prisoners with HYDRA, just order. And order only comes through pain. You ready for yours?\
Sam Wilson: Man, shut the hell up. [they both go to attack each other]\
Alexander Pierce: Lieutenant, how much longer?\
Charlie XO: [on radio] Sixty-five seconds to satellite link. Targeting grid engaged. Lowering weapons array now.\
Maria Hill: [to Steve as she watches from the monitor] One minute. [Steve desperately tries to get back up to the Helicarriers to get to the targeting system when Bucky becomes conscious and shoots at Steve in the left thigh and then the right shoulder, but Steve still manages to climb up] Thirty seconds, Cap!\
Steve Rogers: Stand by. [he gets the chip out] Charlie... [Bucky shoots Steve in the stomach and he falls]\
[On the helicarrier's bridge]\
Charlie Weapons Tech: We've reached three thousand feet. Sat link coming online now.\
Charlie XO: Deploy algorithm.\
Charlie Weapons Tech: Algorithm deployed.\
Alexander Pierce: [on radio] We are go to targets. [Hill watches as the weapons are being targeted at Washington, the White house, the Pentagon, Stark Tower, aiming to kill over 700,00 people.]\
Charlie Weapons Tech: Target saturation reached. All targets assigned.\
Charlie XO: Fire when ready.\
Charlie Weapons Tech: Firing in, three, two, one. [at that moment Steve manages to get up and place the chip in the Helicarrier's targeting blade overriding the system and locking it down]\
Steve Rogers: Charlie locked. [as they watch the targets go offline]\
Charlie XO: Where are the targets? Where are the targets?\
Maria Hill: Okay, Cap, get out of there. [Hill then gets the Helicarriers weapon targets to open fire upon each other]\
Steve Rogers: Fire now.\
Maria Hill: But, Steve...\
Steve Rogers: Do it! Do it now! [reluctantly Hill makes the Helicarriers open fire on each other, Steve still inside the Helicarrier looks at Bucky below him; back at the Triskelion Pierce watches the Helicarriers as they are firing at each other]\
Alexander Pierce: What a waste.\
Natasha Romanoff: Are you still on the fence about Rogers' chances?\
Alexander Pierce: Time to go, Councilwoman. This way, come on. You're gonna fly me out of here. [as Pierce starts to leave with Natasha]\
Nick Fury: You know, there was a time I would have taken a bullet for you.\
Alexander Pierce: You already did. You will again when it's useful. [just then Natasha activates a small disc that emits an electric shock through her whole body and disables the pin, this gives Fury a chance to shoot Pierce, which he does so twice, Fury then walks over to Natasha who is lying unconscious on the floor]\
Nick Fury: Romanoff! Natasha! Natasha, come on! [Natasha opens her eyes]\
Natasha Romanoff: Ow. Those really do sting.\
Alexander Pierce: [as the Helicarriers continue to destroy each other Pierce lies on the floor and says with his last dieing breath] Hail HYDRA. [just then one Helicarrier crashes into a dam beneath the Triskelion] [as the Helicarrier continues to fall with Cap and Winter Soldier inside, at the Triskelion Sam and Rumlow continue to fight each other]\
Brock Rumlow: You're out of your depth, kid. [suddenly the first Helicarrier crashes into the Triskelion, catching Rumlow in the destruction]\
Sam Wilson: [to Natasha who is in the helicopter as he sprints away] Please, tell me you got that chopper in the air!\
Natasha Romanoff: Sam, where are you?\
Sam Wilson: 41st floor, north-west corner!\
Natasha Romanoff: We're on it, stay where you are. [Sam desperately tries to get away from the destruction the Helicarrier is causing to the building] Not an option! [as the building is being destroyed Sam jumps out of the window as Natasha and Fury fly their chopper barely in time to catch him]\
Sam Wilson: 41st floor! 41st!\
Nick Fury: It's not like they put the floor numbers on the outside of the building!\
Natasha Romanoff: Hill, where's Steve? You got a location on Rogers?\
[inside the third Helicarrier we see Steve help Bucky out from being trapped under some fallen rubble]\
Steve Rogers: You know me. [Bucky lashes out at Steve in anger]\
Bucky Barnes: No, I don't!\
Steve Rogers: Bucky, you've known me your whole life. [Bucky hits Steve but Steve chooses not to fight back] Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. [Bucky hits Steve again]\
Bucky Barnes: Shut up! [Steve takes off his mask and drops his shield out of the Helicarrier]\
Steve Rogers: I'm not gonna fight you. You're my friend. [Bucky pushes Steve to the ground]\
Bucky Barnes: You're my mission. [he then mercilessly punches Steve repeatedly across the face] You're my mission!\
Steve Rogers: Then finish it. [Bucky hesitates holding his fist up] Cause I'm with you to the end of the line. [Bucky looks at Steve as if he's starting to remember just then the bottom of the Helicarrier falls sending Steve down into the river below as Bucky watches from the Helicarrier, then we see an unconscious Steve being pulled out of the water and dragged onto the shore by Bucky before he turns and walks away]\
[In a hospital, in a room guarded by two armed agents, we see Steve waking up in a bed to hear Marvin Gaye's "Trouble Man" playing with Sam sat next to his bed]\
Steve Rogers: On your left. [Sam looks at Steve and smiles]\
[we then see Agent 13 practicing shooting at a shooting range wearing a CIA t-shirt; we see Hill at Stark Industries about to undergo a lie detector test; then Senator Stern getting arrested and then a badly burnt Rumlow being treated by doctors at the hospital; Natasha is then being sworn in at a committee hearing]\
Bailiff: Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth?\
Natasha Romanoff: I do.\
Committee General: Why haven't we yet heard from Captain Rogers?\
Natasha Romanoff: I don't know what there is left left for him to say. I think the wreck in the middle of the Potomac made his point fairly eloquently.\
Committee General: Well, he could explain how this country's expected to maintain its national security now that he and you have laid waste to our intelligence apparatus.\
Natasha Romanoff: HYDRA was selling you lies, not intelligence.\
Committee General: Many of which you seem to have had a personal hand in telling.\
Scudder: Agent, you should know that there are some on this committee who feel, given your service record, both for this country and against it, that you belong in a penitentiary, not mouthing off on Capitol Hill.\
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna put me in a prison. You're not gonna put any of us in a prison. You know why?\
Scudder: Do enlighten us.\
Natasha Romanoff: Because you need us. Yes, the world is a vulnerable place, and yes, we helped make it that way. But we're also the ones best qualified to defend it. So if you want to arrest me, arrest me. You'll know where to find me. [she gets up and walks away, meanwhile Fury gets rid of any trace of his existence, including his passports and eyepatch, burning them and his hiding place]\
Nick Fury: [wearing sunglasses and hoodie, Fury meets Steve and Sam at a cemetery at his own grave] So, you've experienced this sort of thing before?\
Steve Rogers: You get used to it. [we see Fury's gravestone which bears bears the epitaph "The path of the righteous man. Ezekiel 25:17"]\
Nick Fury: We've been data-mining HYDRA's files. Looks like a lot of rats didn't go down with the ship. I'm headed to Europe tonight, wanted to ask if you'd come.\
Steve Rogers: There's something I gotta do first.\
Nick Fury: How about you, Wilson? Could use a man with your abilities.\
Sam Wilson: I'm more of a soldier than a spy.\
Nick Fury: Alright then. [Sam and Steve shake Fury's hand] Anybody asks for me, tell them they can find me right here. [Fury looks to his gravestone and walks away, just then Natasha joins Steve and Sam]\
Natasha Romanoff: You should be honored, that's about as close as he gets to saying thank you.\
Steve Rogers: Not going with him?\
Natasha Romanoff: No.\
Steve Rogers: Not staying here?\
Natasha Romanoff: I blew all my covers, I gotta go figure out a new one.\
Steve Rogers: That might take a while.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm counting on it. That thing you asked for, I called in a few favors from Kiev. [she hands Steve a file titled "
\f1 \uc0\u1076 \u1077 \u1083 \u1086 
\f0  No 17" (file No 17)] Will you do me a favor? Call that nurse.\
Steve Rogers: She's not a nurse.\
Natasha Romanoff: And you're not a SHIELD agent.\
Steve Rogers: What was her name again?\
Natasha Romanoff: Sharon. She's nice. [she kisses Steve on the cheek and turns to walk away] Be careful, Steve. You might not want to pull on that thread. [as Natasha walks away Steve opens the file, which is about Bucky and the information regarding his Winter Soldier transformation, Sam walks over to Steve]\
Sam Wilson: You're going after him?\
Steve Rogers: You don't have to come with me.\
Sam Wilson: I know. When do we start?\
[mid-credits scene; at an underground HYDRA lab Baron Wolfgang von Strucker is talking with a HYDRA scientist]\
List: It's over. Fury has released everything to the public.\
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: Everything he knows about.\
List: Herr Strucker, if they get word of our work here, if they find out we serve HYDRA...\
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: HYDRA, SHIELD, two sides of a coin that's no longer currency. [they walk over to the corner of the lab where Loki's scepter is being kept] What we have is worth more than any of them ever knew. We've only scratched the surface and already... [they start walking out of the lab] There are other facilities doing HYDRA's good work around the world. We'll feed them to Captain America and his colorful friends. Keep them off our scent.\
List: What about the volunteers?\
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The dead will be buried so deep their own ghosts won't be able to find them.\
List: And the survivors?\
Baron Wolfgang von Strucker: The twins. [we see the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, being kept in glass cells each exhibiting their powers, Pietro having superhuman speed and Wanda having telekinetic powers] Sooner or later they will meet the twins. It's not a world of spies anymore, not even a world of heroes. This is the age of miracles, doctor. There's nothing more horrifying than a miracle.\
(The post-credits scene; at the Captain America exhibit in the Smithsonian Museum we see Bucky in civilian clothes staring pensively at the display about himself.)\
\
(End of "Captain America: The Winter Soldier".)\
Odin: [voice over] Long before the birth of light there was darkness, and from that darkness, came the Dark Elves. Millennia ago, the most ruthless of their kind, Malekith, sought to transform our universe back into one of eternal night.\
[Malekith is looking up at the Convergence]\
Odin: Such evil was possible through the power of the Aether, an ancient force of infinite destruction.\
[the Aether is shown]\
Odin: The noble armies of Asgard, led by my father, King Bor, waged a mighty war against these creatures.\
[the Dark Elves and Asgardians are shown fighting]\
[Kurse walks up to Malekith]\
Kurse: [subtitled] Malekith! Asgard's forces are upon us.\
[the Bifrost opens, and bor steps out with Asgardian reinforcements]\
Malekith: Send the Kursed.\
[some soldiers crush objects in their hands and become giant hulk-like creatures]\
[Malekith looks up at the Convergence again]\
Odin: As the Nine Worlds converged above him, Malekith could at last unleash the Aether...\
[Malekith and Kurse walk up to the Aether]\
[however, the Bifrost opens and Asgardian warriors attack Malekith, whom he kills]\
[the Bifrost disappears, just as Malekith tries to get the Aether, but it is no longer there]\
Odin: But Asgard ripped the weapon from his grasp. Without it, the Dark Elves fell. With the battle all but lost, Malekith sacrificed his own people in a desperate attempt to lay waste to Asgard's army.\
[Malekith watches as his forces are slaughtered]\
Malekith: [subtitled] Their deaths will mean our survival. This war is far from over.\
[he and Kurse get onto his ship and escape without notice, while destroying the other ships in the process]\
[the ships kill some of the Asgardians]\
Odin: Malekith was vanquished, and the Aether was no more. Or so we were led to believe.\
Asgardian Einherjar: Sire, the Aether. Shall we destroy it?\
Bor: If only we could. But its power is too great. Bury it deep. Somewhere no one will ever find it.\
[Asgard \'96 Throne Room. Loki, in chains, is brought to Odin.]\
Frigga: Loki.\
Loki: Hello, mother. Have I made you proud?\
Frigga: Please, don't make this worse.\
Loki: Define worse.\
Odin: Enough! I will speak to the prisoner alone.\
[Frigga leaves.]\
Loki: [laughs] I really don't see what all the fuss is about.\
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death.\
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent god. Just like you.\
Odin: We are not gods. We are born, we live, we die. Just as humans do.\
Loki: Give or take 5000 years.\
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne.\
Loki: It is my birthright.\
Odin: Your birthright was to die as a child. Cast out onto a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in you would not be here now to hate me.\
Loki: If I am for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't love our little talks, it's just ... I don't love them.\
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you are still alive and you will never see her again. You will spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.\
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf king while I rot in chains?\
Odin: Thor must strife to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the nine realms and then, yes. He will be king.\
[Cut to Vanaheim]\
[Sif, the Warriors Three and Thor are fighting in a battle.]\
Sif: I've got this completely under control!\
Thor: Is that why everything is on fire?\
[Sif catches an arrow that was aimed at Thor with her shield.]\
Sif: You're welcome. [a Kronan arrives] All yours.\
Thor: Hello. [the Kronan growls] I accept your surrender.\
[The soldiers laugh. Thor swings his hammer and crushes the Kronan.]\
Thor: Anyone else?\
[The soldiers surrender.]\
Fandral: Perhaps next time we should start with the big one.\
Guard: Keep moving. Come on! Keep moving. Go ahead of me. Don't you turn around!\
Hogun: Where do we go next?\
Thor: Hogun, the peace is nearly won across the Nine Realms. You should stay here. Be with your people, where your heart is. Asgard can wait.\
Hogun: You have my thanks.\
Thor: As you have mine. Heimdall, when you're ready.\
[Cut to Asgard]\
Odin: Is Vanaheim secure?\
Thor: As are Nornheim and Ria. Though our work would have gone more quickly with you at the fore.\
Odin: You must think I'm a piece of bread that needs to be buttered so heavily.\
Thor: That was not my intent.\
Odin: For the first time since the Bifrost was destroyed, the Nine Realms are at peace. They're well reminded of our strength and you have earned their respect and my gratitude.\
Thor: Thank you.\
Odin: Nothing out of order except your confused and distracted heart.\
Thor: This isn't about Jane Foster, Father.\
Odin: Human lives are fleeting, they are nothing. You'd be better served by what lies in front of you [Camera briefly turns to Sif] I'm telling you this not as the all-father but as your father. You are ready. The time has come for you to take the throne. Embrace and celebrate what you've won. Join your warriors. Eat and drink, revel in their celebration. At least pretend to enjoy yourself.\
[and as they celebrate, as he watches the others enjoying themselves it's obvious his heart is not in it, he walks over to the balcony to join Sif]\
Sif: There was a time you would celebrate for weeks.\
Thor: I remember you celebrated the battle of Haragon so much that you nearly started a second.\
Sif: Well, the first was so much fun.\
[they both smile]\
Sif: Take a drink with me. Surely the All-Father could have no further task for you tonight.\
Thor: No, this is one I set myself.\
Sif: It has not gone unnoticed that you disappear each night. There are Nine Realms. Future king of Asgard must focus on more than one.\
Thor: I thank you for your sword and for your counsel, good Lady Sif.\
[he turns and walks off]\
[in London Jane is on a date with a man named Richard, Jane is looking at her menu feeling awkward when Richard slides a napkin in front of her with the word 'Hi' written on it]\
Richard: Hi.\
Jane Foster: Hi.\
Richard: So what's the story with you?\
Jane Foster: Why does there have to be a story, there's no story.\
Richard: You've spent the first ten minutes of our date hiding behind a menu that has three choices on it. It's either chicken, vegetarian or fish, Jane. I think there's a story and I'm thinking the story involves a guy?\
Jane Foster: It's complicated.\
Richard: Is he still around?\
Jane Foster: No, he...went away.\
Richard: I've been there. The going away, it's hard. I'd been seeing a woman and uh...she took a job in New York, eventually the distance killed it. And...and the fact that she uh...she kept sleeping with other dudes.\
Jane Foster: No!\
Richard: Oh, so many.\
[Darcy walks up to Jane and Richard's table]\
Richard: Hi. Um...could we get some wine please?\
Darcy Lewis: Sure, I'd love some.\
Jane Foster: Richard, this is Darcy. [to Darcy] What are you doing here?\
[Darcy grabs a chair from the opposite table and drags it across to their table]\
Richard: Oh, hello.\
[Darcy sits next to Jane and helps herself to a piece of bread and starts buttering it]\
Darcy Lewis: So, I show up to work at the lab-slash-your mom's house, fully expecting you to be moping around in your pajamas eating ice cream obsessing about you know who...\
Richard: Ah.\
Darcy Lewis: But you're not! You're wearing lady clothes, you even showered, didn't you? You smell good.\
Jane Foster: Is there a point to all this, cause there really has to be a point to all this.\
Darcy Lewis: Right. You know that scientific equipment you don't look at anymore? You might wanna start looking at it now\
[she gives Jane the gadget]\
Darcy Lewis: This is the reason we came all the way out here.\
Jane Foster: It's malfunctioning.\
Darcy Lewis: That's what I said.\
[Jane starts hitting the gadget on the table]\
Darcy Lewis: That's what I did! But you just hit a little more scientific.\
Jane Foster: I'm sure it's nothing.\
Richard: Yeah.\
[Jane hands the gadget back to Darcy]\
Darcy Lewis: It didn't look like nothing. Kind of looks like the readings that Erik was rambling about. [to Richard] Our friend Erik, kind of went banana-balls.\
Jane Foster: He's not interested. I'm not interested. Time for you to go now.\
Darcy Lewis: Okay.\
[Jane rises and drags her chair back to where she got it from, then turns and walks off]\
Richard: Short but sweet.\
Jane Foster: She needs help.\
[they start looking at their menus again, but Jane looks distracted by what Darcy told her]\
Richard: I think I'm gonna have the sea bass.\
Jane Foster: Sea bass. Yeah, sea bass is good.\
[to herself as she thinks about what Darcy showed her]\
Jane Foster: Sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass, sea bass...sea bass. Sea bass...\
Richard: Jane, maybe you should stop saying sea bass and go out to your friend.\
[Jane looks at him awkwardly]\
Jane Foster: This was so fun.\
Richard: You know, I'll just stay here and say sea bass alone.\
[Jane enters Darcy's car parked outside the restaurant]\
Jane Foster: And I hate you.\
Darcy Lewis: What?! I thought he was cute.\
Jane Foster: Just shut up and drive.\
[Darcy pulls out and drive off, as they are driving through London suddenly Jane's is shocked to see a guy sat in the back seat]\
Jane Foster: Who's he?\
Darcy Lewis: He's my intern.\
Jane Foster: You have an intern?\
Darcy Lewis: Oh, yeah.\
Ian Boothby: Hello, Dr. Foster. It's uh...it's a great honor to be working with you.\
Jane Foster: Right. I have to call Erik.\
[to Darcy as he checks the navigator]\
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...take a right.\
[Darcy quickly makes a sharp turn]\
Ian Boothby: Left!\
[she then turns quickly left]\
Darcy Lewis: I have totally mastered driving in London.\
[Jane calls Erik and leaves a message]\
Jane Foster: Hi, Erik, it's me again. Where are you? I came here because you said you were onto something and then vanished.\
[a news report is then shown where Selvig is naked and running around Stonehenge while the police try to catch him]\
Stonehenge TV News Reporter: I'm here at Stonehenge, for what has been an interesting unfolding of events today. The police reported the scene shortly after 11 a.m. this morning, after a seemingly harmless rambler approached the area then started to strip naked and effectively terrorize tourists there with scientific equipment while shouting that he was trying to save them. The man later identified as noted Astrophysicist Dr. Erik Selvig has been called in for questioning by police.\
[Darcy pulls up outside an old abandoned factory and they all get out of the car]\
Darcy Lewis: Come on, this is exciting! Look, the intern is excited.\
Ian Boothby: Ian.\
Darcy Lewis: Do you want the phase meter?\
Jane Foster: No.\
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Bring the phase meter.\
[she throws the car keys at Ian and starts walking off]\
Darcy Lewis: The toaster looking thing.\
Ian Boothby: I know what the phase meter is.\
[as Jane walks towards the factory Darcy calls her on her cell phone which starts playing an annoying music tone]\
Jane Foster: How do I change the ring tone on this thing?\
Darcy Lewis: An Astrophysicist with three degrees should be able to change her own ring tone.\
[Jane turns to look at Darcy]\
Jane Foster: Why are you calling me?\
Darcy Lewis: I didn't want to shout. [to Ian, who's following behind her] Intern, the entrance is this way.\
Ian Boothby: Ian. My name's Ian.\
[as they enter the old factory they hear a noise]\
Darcy Lewis: I am not getting stabbed in the name of science.\
[she holds up her hands and shouts]\
Darcy Lewis: It's okay, we're Americans!\
Jane Foster: Is that supposed to make them like us?\
[suddenly the hear some kids voices]\
Maddie: Make it go away...\
Navid: Ssh!\
[three kids come out of their hiding place]\
Jane Foster: Oh, they're kids.\
Maddie: Are you the police?\
Jane Foster: No, we're scientists. Well, I am.\
Darcy Lewis: Thanks.\
Navid: We just found it.\
Jane Foster: Can you show us?\
[the three kids lead Jane, Darcy and Ian to a truck, one of the boys touches the truck and pushes it up with two fingers, they watch in amazement as the truck floats in mid-air]\
Darcy Lewis: That doesn't seem rigged.\
[the kids then take them to a stairwell in the factory, one of them drops a bottle down and they watch as the bottle disappears into thin air]\
Darcy Lewis: Where did it go?\
[the girl points her finger up, they look up to see the bottle reappear above them and continuously fall and disappear in the same spots in the air]\
Darcy Lewis: That's...that's incredible.\
[Jane picks up an empty can and drops it down and it does the same thing, it disappears into thin air, but when they look up to watch it reappear nothing happens]\
Darcy Lewis: What happened?\
Maddie: Sometimes they come back, sometimes they don't.\
Darcy Lewis: I want to throw something. Jane, give me your shoe.\
[Jane picks up her gadget to look at the readings]\
Jane Foster: I haven't seen readings like this since...\
Darcy Lewis: New Mexico?\
[Jane give Darcy a meaningful look before rushing off]\
Jane Foster: Don't touch anything!\
Darcy Lewis: [to Ian] Give me your shoe.\
[Jane walks away from the others and watches them on the stairwell dropping objects down and watching them disappear and reappear, she sees looks at her gadget and sees the anomaly is nearby and starts walking off; back on the stairwell, Ian drops the car keys down and they watch it disappear but when they look up it doesn't reappear]\
Darcy Lewis: Where those the car keys?\
[Jane follows the readings on her gadget which takes her to another part of the factory, as the readings get stronger a gust of wind pushes her forward and she finds herself teleported in another realm]\
Jane Foster: Darcy!\
[she looks around and finds the column holding the Aether, she reaches her hand out and suddenly the Aether enters her body and she passes out; at the same time we see Malekith being awakened in his ship, knowing that the Aether has been found]\
Malekith: [subtitled] The Aether awakens us. The Convergence returns.\
[back in Asgard, Thor walks up the bridge towards Heimdall]\
Heimdall: You're late.\
Thor: Merriment can sometimes be a heavier burden than battle.\
Heimdall: Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.\
[Thor chuckles]\
Thor: Perhaps. How fare the stars?\
Heimdall: Still shining. From here I can see Nine Realms and ten trillion souls.\
[Heimdall looks at Thor for a moment]\
Heimdall: You recall what I told you of the Convergence?\
Thor: Yes, the alignment of the worlds. It approaches, doesn't it?\
Heimdall: The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began. Few can sense, even fewer can see it. A world that's infected can be dangerous. It is truly beautiful.\
[they looks out into the stars]\
Thor: I see nothing.\
Heimdall: Or perhaps that is not the beauty you seek.\
[Thor laughs]\
Thor: How is she?\
Heimdall: She's quite clever, your mortal. She doesn't know it yet, but she studies the Convergence as well. Even...\
[Heimdall stops as he senses something]\
Thor: What?\
Heimdall: I can't see her.\
[we see Jane being infected by the Aether] [after Jane is infected with the Aether she reawakens in the factory, she runs out to find Darcy has called the police]\
Darcy Lewis: Jane! Where the hell were you?\
Jane Foster: Tell me you didn't call the police!\
Darcy Lewis: What was I supposed to do?\
Jane Foster: Not call the police!\
Darcy Lewis: I was freaking out.\
Jane Foster: You call the cops they tell the feds, the next thing you know we have SHIELD crawling all over area fifty-one-ing the place.\
Darcy Lewis: Jane!\
Jane Foster: We had a stable gratification anomaly, we had unheeded access. Our only competition was ten years old!\
Darcy Lewis: Jane, you were gone for five hours!\
Jane Foster: What? [suddenly the weather turns, it starts raining and they hear the sound of thunder, Jane looks around her and puts her hand out]\
Darcy Lewis: That's weird. [they see it's raining but it's not raining on Jane and Darcy, there's an invisible barrier protecting them, suddenly Jane sees Thor standing a few feet away from them, Jane hands her gadget to Darcy and walks towards Thor, as she walks away the invisible barrier follows her and the rain starts falling on Darcy] Typical. [as Jane walks towards Thor]\
Thor: Jane. [as she reaches him suddenly she slaps him hard in the face]\
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just needed to make sure you were real, it's been a very strange day.\
Thor: Well, I am. Jane... [suddenly she slaps him again]\
Jane Foster: Where were you?!\
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.\
Jane Foster: I was right here where you left me. I was waiting and then I was crying and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back\
Thor: I know, I know, but the Bifrost was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos, wars were raging, marauding hordes were pillaging. I had to put an end to the slaughter.\
Jane Foster: As excuses go, that's not terrible. But I saw you on TV, you were...you were in New York!\
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong, I was a fool. [Thor places his hand Jane's face] I believe that fate brought us together. Jane, I don't know where you were or what happened, but I do know this.\
Jane Foster: What?\
Thor: I know...\
Jane Foster: You do?\
Thor: Do what? [they lean in close and just as they are about to kiss Darcy interrupts them; referring to the rain]\
Jane Foster: Hey! Is that you? [Thor looks up and the rain stops]\
Jane Foster: Uh...we're kind of in the middle of something.\
Darcy Lewis: Um...I'm pretty sure we are getting arrested.\
Jane Foster: [to Thor] Hold that thought. [she turns and runs towards the police]\
Darcy Lewis: Look at you, still all muscly and everything. How's space?\
Thor: Space is fine. [Jane walks over to the police]\
Jane Foster: Excuse me?\
Police Officer #1: Are you Jane Foster?\
Jane Foster: Yes.\
Police Officer #1: [referring to Ian] Do you know this man?\
Jane Foster: He's my intern. My intern's intern.\
Police Officer #1: This is private property and you're trespassing, the lot of you. You'll have to come with me. [the police officer goes t grab Jane's arm but suddenly the force from the Aether creates a powerful force which pushes the officer and everything else away, Thor runs towards Jane who's lying on the ground]\
Thor: Jane! Jane? [he helps her stand] You alright?\
Jane Foster: What just happened? [the other police officer approaches Jane apprehensively]\
Police Officer #2: Place your hands on your head, step back!\
Thor: The woman is unwell.\
Police Officer #2: She's dangerous.\
Thor: So am I. [talking into his radio]\
Police Officer #2: Requesting armed response officers to the scene. [Thor grabs Jane and pulls her closer to him]\
Thor: Hold on to me.\
Jane Foster: What are you doing? [suddenly the Bifrost opens and Thor takes Jane to Asgard; Darcy looks up as they disappear]\
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [Thor and Jane travel through the Bifrost and enter Asgard where Heimdall is guarding as always, Jane looks around her in amazement]\
Jane Foster: We have to do that again. [she notices Heimdall for the first time] Hi.\
Heimdall: Welcome to Asgard. [returning to their homeland, Svartalfheim, Malekith kneels and grabs a handful of dust from the ground]\
Malekith: [subtitled] Look at my legacy, Algrim. I barely remember the time before light. [Algrim places his hand on Malekith's shoulder]\
Algrim: [subtitled] Our survival will be your legacy.\
Malekith: [subtitled] The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world and I'll put an end to this poisonous world. [as the Asgardian physicians study Jane and the force within her]\
Jane Foster: What's that?\
Eir: Be still. [Thor watches with one of the nurses as they examine Jane]\
Thor: This is not of Earth, what is it?\
Asgardian Nurse: We do not know, but she will not survive the amount of energy surging within her. [the nurse turns and walks away as Thor looks at Jane with worry]\
Jane Foster: That's a quantum field generator, isn't it?\
Eir: It's a Soul Forge.\
Jane Foster: Does a Soul Forge transfer molecular energy from one place to another? [Eir looks impressed]\
Eir: Yes. [Jane looks at Thor and whispers]\
Jane Foster: It's a quantum field generator. [Thor smiles at her] [Odin enters the room as the Thor looks on to Jane as she is being examined]\
Odin: My words are mere noises to you that you ignore them completely?\
Thor: She's ill.\
Odin: She is mortal. Illness is their defining trait.\
Thor: I brought here because we can help her.\
Odin: She does not belong here in Asgard anymore than a goat belongs at a banquet table. [Jane sits up and looks at Thor]\
Jane Foster: Did he just...? [to Odin] Who do you think you are?\
Odin: I'm Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.\
Jane Foster: Oh. Well, I'm...\
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster. [Jane turns to look at Thor]\
Jane Foster: You told your Dad about me?\
Thor: Something is within her, father, something I have not seen before.\
Odin: Her world has its healers, their called doctors, let them deal with it. Guards, take her back to Midgard. [as two guards approach Jane and go to grab her, suddenly the energy force within her sets off again throwing the two guards aside]\
Thor: Don't touch her. [he leans down and tenderly touches Jane] Jane, are you alright? [Jane nods her head, Odin inspects the energy force running through Jane's body and realizes it's the Aether]\
Odin: That's impossible.\
Eir: The infection, it's defending her.\
Thor: No, it's defending itself.\
Odin: Come with me. There are relics that predate the universe itself. What lies within her appears to be one of them. The Nine Realms are not eternal. They had a dawn as they will have a dusk. [Odin shows Thor and Jane an ancient book] But before that dawn the dark forces, the Dark Elves, reigned absolute and unchallenged.\
Thor: [reading from the book] "Born of eternal night, the Dark Elves comes to steal away your light." They were these stories mother told us as children.\
Odin: Their leader, Malekith made a weapon out of that darkness, it was called the Aether. While the other relics often appeared as stones, the Aether is fluid and ever changing. It changes matter into dark matter and seeks out to host bodies, drawing strength from their life force. Malekith sought to use the Aether's power to return the universe to one of darkness. But after eternities of blood shed, my father Bor, finally triumphed, ushering in the peace that lasted thousands of years.\
Jane Foster: What happened?\
Odin: He killed them all.\
Thor: Are you certain? The Aether was said to have been destroyed with them and yet here it is.\
Odin: The Dark Elves are dead.\
Jane Foster: Does your book happen to mention how to get it out of me?\
Odin: No, it does not. [back on Svartalfheim, in his ship Malekith plots his vengeance against the Asgardians]\
Malekith: [subtitled] The Realms will be aligned soon. [Malekith takes out a knife and turns to Algrim]\
Malekith: [subtitled] You'll be the last of the Kursed. [Malekith stabs Algrim in the stomach with his knife]\
Algrim: [subtitled] Let my life be sacrificed. The same as our people.\
Malekith: [subtitled] You will become darkness, doomed to this existence until it consumes you. [one of the dark elves places a molten rock in Malekith's hand and Malekith places it inside Algrim's stomach] And then no power of our enemies will stop me.\
Algrim: [subtitled] I'll destroy their defenses and resurrect the universe. [Malekith looks to one of his dark elves as he carries a mask] [Fandral and Volstagg return to Asgard with several prisoners, including the masked Algrim; Loki watches them from his cell as they come in]\
Loki: Odin continues to bring me new friends. How thoughtful.\
Frigga: The books I sent, do they not interest you? [Loki turns and we see Frigga is in Loki's cell]\
Loki: Is that how I'm to while away eternity, reading?\
Frigga: I've done everything in my power to make you comfortable, Loki.\
Loki: Have you? Does Odin share your concern? Does Thor? It must be so inconvenient them asking after me day and night.\
Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\
Loki: My actions. I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life, that I was born to be a king.\
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.\
Frigga: Your father...\
Loki: [shouts] He's not my father!\
Frigga: Then am I not your mother? [Loki hesitates for a moment]\
Loki: You're not. [Frigga smiles at him with tears in her eyes]\
Frigga: Always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [she takes a step towards him and extends her hands, Loki goes to touch her hand but his hand goes through hers and we see that she's a hologram, Loki looks at Frigga with sadness and her hologram disappears] [Jane and Thor walk in Asgard]\
Jane Foster: When you came for me, you knew I was in trouble.\
Thor: Well Heimdall had lost sight of you, you were no longer on Earth.\
Jane Foster: Well, how's that possible?\
Thor: I believe you were in between worlds. The Nine Realms travel within Yggdrasil, orbiting Midgard in much the way your planet orbits the sun. Every five thousand years the worlds align perfectly, we call this the Convergence. [he takes her hand and he shows her by touching his palm to hers] During this time the boarders between worlds become blurred. It's possible you found one of these points. We are lucky that it remained open. Once the worlds pass out of alignment, the connection is lost. [he leans closer and they kiss]\
Jane Foster: I liked the way you explained that. What's gonna happen to me?\
Thor: I'll find a way to save you, Jane.\
Jane Foster: Your father said there was...\
Thor: My father doesn't know everything. [suddenly they are interrupted by Frigga]\
Frigga: Don't let him hear you say that.\
Thor: Jane Foster, please meet Frigga, the Queen of Asgard, my mother. [Jane looking embarrassed quickly removes her hand from Thor's mother, Frigga]\
Jane Foster: Hi. [in his cell, Algrim pulls out the rock that Malekith had placed in his stomach, he crushes it in his hand, transforming himself into a Kursed, he breaks free and releases the other prisoners, Loki watches all this from his cell, then Algrim walks up to Loki's cell and he look at Loki for a moment before turning and walking away]\
Loki: You might want to take the stairs to the left. [Algrim turns and looks at Loki before walking away again; outside they hear the prison alarm going off]\
Frigga: The prisons.\
Thor: Loki.\
Frigga: [referring to Jane] Go, I will look after her. [Thor takes off with his hammer; in the prison Volstagg and Fandral enter the fight with the prisoners]\
Fandral: It's as if they resent being imprisoned.\
Volstagg: There's no pleasing some creatures. [as they continue to fight, Loki is sat calmly in his cell reading, suddenly Thor enters and everyone turns to look at him]\
Thor: Return to your cells and further harm will come to you. You have my word. [suddenly one of the prisoners punches him in the face] Very well, you don't have my word. [Thor punches him back and starts fighting with the other prisoners]\
Odin: [to his guards] Send a squadron to the weapons vault, defend it at all costs. Seal the dungeon.\
Frigga: Odin.\
Odin: Frigga. [to the Asgardian guards] Go! [to Frigga and Jane] It's a skirmish, nothing to fear.\
Frigga: You've never been a very good liar. [at that moment Jane notices Sif as she walks past them]\
Odin: Take her to you chambers, I'll come for you when it's safe.\
Frigga: You take care.\
Odin: Despite all I have survived, my queen still worries over me.\
Frigga: It's only because I worry over you that you have survived. [Odin goes off, Frigga leads Jane away, she takes a sword from one of the guards] Listen to me now, I need you to do everything I ask and no questions.\
Jane Foster: Yes, ma'am. [as Heimdall is stood in his usual guarding post, he suddenly hears something turns and runs out onto the Bifrost Bridge, he jumps onto one of Malekith's ships cloaked in invisibility, making it visible and manages to send it crashing into the sea, but he soon finds that a giant ship is behind him releasing smaller ships to attack Asgard, Heimdall activates a shield to protect Asgard but Algrim manages to deactivate it sending a ship to crash into the palace] [after Malekith's ship has crashed into the palace the Dark Elves start attacking the Asgardian soldiers killing them all, Malekith leaves the ship and goes to look for Frigga and Jane after which Odin arrives to find all the soldiers killed]\
Odin: Frigga. [Malekith finds the tower where Frigga is hiding Jane and enters the room]\
Frigga: Stand down, creature. You may still survive this.\
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.\
Frigga: Who are you?\
Malekith: I am Malekith, and I would have what it is mine. [as he walks closer to Frigga she strikes him in the face with her sword, he takes out his blade and starts fighting with Frigga, she puts up a good fight but Algrim comes to his aid and subdues her, Malekith walks towards Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith stands in front of Jane and as he goes to grab her she disappears and he realizes that she's a hologram, he turns to Frigga] Witch! Where is the Aether?\
Frigga: I'll never tell.\
Malekith: I believe you. [suddenly Algrim stabs Frigga in the back, at the same time Thor rushes in and shoots a lightning bolt at Malekith's face, severely scarring it, he and Algrim escape and jump onto their ship before Thor can catch them; after Malekith and Algrim escape Odin arrives to find Frigga dead, he holds her body in his arms as Thor and Jane look on, a funeral is held for Frigga where all the Asgardians mourn her as her body is pushed out to the sea on a boat and the boat burnt by a flaming arrow, at the same time Loki expresses his grief in his cell] [back on Earth Erik has been institutionalized and is trying to explain the convergence to the patients in his ward]\
Erik Selvig: The universe rotates on a five thousand year cycle, and once its cycled all the worlds align. [he picks up a shoe and holds it up] Imagine...imagine that this is our world, and...and... [one of the patients hands him another shoe] Oh, thank you. And this is another world. Normally they're separate, but during the alignment everything is connected. All Nine Realms, all Nine Realms are passing through each other and gravity, light, and even matter, is crunching from one world to the other. [he demonstrates with the shoes by smacking one on top of the other repeatedly] But if this happens to us now, the result would be cataclysmic. [he then puts the shoes down and picks up two pencils and holds them up] My gravimetric spikes can stabilize the focal point of the Convergence. [he puts the pencil down and picks up the shoes again] This time the alignment, and all the other worlds, would just pass up by. It's beautiful. It's simple. Any questions? [we see the patients in the ward just carrying on with their activity, no one has really taken any notice of him, then one of the patients (Stan Lee) interrupts]\
Patient: Yeah. Can I have my shoe back? [on their ship; to Malekith]\
Algrim: [subtitled] I need your strength to reclaim the Aether. And when you wake up, you will kill them all.[in Asgard, Jane is sat in her room when suddenly the power of the Aether surrounds her and everything around her turns red for a moment, then Volstagg enters the room with two guards]\
Einherjar Lieutenant: Jane Foster. You need to come with us. [Fandral and Odin inspect the damage to the palace where Malekith had crashed his ship]\
Fandral: We are still unable to restore the palace shields. Our artillery cannot detect them, even Heimdall cannot see them. My King, we are all but defenseless. [Thor approaches them]\
Thor: She's your prisoner now? [to Fandral, Volstagg and the guards] Leave us. [they all start walking off and leave Thor with Odin]\
Odin: I do not wish to fight with you.\
Thor: Nor I with you, but I intend to pursue Malekith.\
Odin: We possess the Aether, Malekith will come to us.\
Thor: Yes, and you will destroy us.\
Odin: You overestimate the power of these creatures.\
Thor: No, I value our peoples lives. I'll take Jane to the Dark World and draw the enemy away from Asgard. When Malekith pulls the Aether from Jane it will be exposed vulnerable, and I will destroy it and him.\
Odin: If you fail, you risk this weapon falling into the hands of our enemies.\
Thor: The risk is far greater if we do nothing. His ship could be over our heads right now and we'd never even know it.\
Odin: If and when he comes, his men will fall by ten thousand Asgardian blades.\
Thor: And how of our men shall fall on theirs?\
Odin: As many as are needed! [there's a moment pause] We will fight! Until the last Asgardian breath, the last drop of Asgardian blood.\
Thor: And how are you different from Malekith? [Odin chuckles]\
Odin: The difference, my son, is that I will win. [Odin turns and walks off] [back on Earth, Darcy paces around her apartment as Ian is sat watching the news on TV]\
Darcy Lewis: Jane isn't called me back. Erik isn't calling me back. Stupid SHIELD isn't calling me back!\
Ian Boothby: What's SHIELD?\
Darcy Lewis: It's a secret. [Darcy leaves a voice message for Erik] Uh...hey, Erik. It's Darcy again. Uh...Thor came back, he took Jane to Asgard and um...I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. [as Ian is watching the news they start reporting about Erik being arrested at Stonehenge]\
News Reporter: Something else went missing this week when Astrophysicist, Dr. Erik Selvig, notable for his involvement in the Alien invasion in New York streaked nude across Stonehenge.\
Ian Boothby: Darcy, you really need to look at this. Your friend Erik, what was his last name again? [Darcy looks at the news report on TV]\
News Reporter: ...disrobed and began shouting at visitors at the historic site. He was later taken into police custody for psychiatric evaluation. The police are still refusing to confirm... [Ian presses the pause button on Erik's face from footage taken at Stonehenge, Darcy sits in dismay as she looks at Erik's face on the TV] [in Asgard, Thor is sat alone when Heimdall walks up to him]\
Thor: You're not in Odin's war council?\
Heimdall: The Bifrost is closed by your father's orders. No one is to come or to go. [Heimdall takes off his helmet and places it on the table] We face an enemy that is invisible even to me. Of what use is a guardian such as that? [he sits down looking defeated]\
Thor: Malekith will return, you know this. I'll need your help.\
Heimdall: I cannot overrule my King's wishes, not even for you.\
\
Thor: I'm not asking you to. The Realms need their All-Father strong and unchallenged, whether he is or not. But he is blinded, Heimdall, by hatred and by grief.\
Heimdall: As are we all.\
Thor: Well I see clearly enough.\
Heimdall: The risks are too great.\
Thor: Everything that we do from here on is a risk, there is no other way. [Heimdall hesitates before replying]\
Heimdall: What do you require of me?\
Thor: What I'm about to ask of you is treason of the highest order. Success will bring us exile and failure shall mean our death. Malekith knew the Aether was here, he can sense its power. If we do nothing he will come for it again, but this time lay waste to all of Asgard. [we see Thor holding a meeting with Sif, Fandral, Volstagg and Heimdall] We must move Jane off world.\
Sif: The Bifrost has been shut down and the Tesseract locked away in a vault.\
Heimdall: There are other paths off Asgard, ways known only to a few.\
Thor: One, actually. [the others suddenly realize he means Loki]\
Volstagg: No. [Thor walks up to Loki's cell where he is standing looking well kept and clean]\
Loki: Thor, after all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [suddenly Loki's cell is transformed, the illusion is lifted and we see that Loki's cell is a mess, everything has been thrown around and he's sat on the floor, looking unkempt and messy, in the other corner of the cell]\
Loki: Now you see me, brother. [Thor walks up to the other side of the cell to be closer to Loki] Did she suffer?\
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\
Loki: Go on.\
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard and I will grant it to you, vengeance. And afterward, this cell. [Loki chuckles]\
Loki: You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me and I will kill you. [Loki smiles]\
Loki: Hmm. When do we start? [back to the meeting with Thor and his comrades]\
Fandral: He will betray you.\
Thor: He will try. [Loki and Thor walk out of the Asgardian prison]\
Loki: This is so unlike you, brother. So clandestine. Are you sure you wouldn't rather just punch your way out?\
Thor: If you keep speaking I just might.\
Loki: Fine. As you wish. I'm not even here. [using his diversion tactics Loki turns himself into an Asgardian guard] Is this better?\
Thor It's better company at least.\
Loki: Still, we could be less conspicuous. [Loki turns back into himself but turns Thor into Sif] Hm, brother. You look ravishing. [Thor looks down at his body then replies in his own voice]\
Thor: It will hurt no less when I kill you in this form.\
Loki: Very well. Perhaps you prefer one of your new companions, given that you seem to like them so much. [Loki then turns himself into Captain America in his full Captain America costume] Oh, this is much better. Woh. The costume's a bit much, so tight. But the confidence, I can feel the righteousness surging. Hey, you wanna have a rousing discussion about truth, honor, patriotism? God bless Amer\'96 [suddenly Thor grabs hold of Loki puts his hand over his mouth and pushes him against the wall making Loki turn back into himself] What? [Thor looks to the side and they see two Asgardian guards walking away] You could at least furnish me with a weapon. My dagger, something! [Thor looks at him and we hear a noise like a sword being drawn] At last, a little common sense. [Loki then looks down then holds up his hands which now have iron handcuffs on them]\
Thor: And I thought you liked tricks. [Thor laughs and turns to walk off] [back at the original meeting Thor was holding with his comrades]\
Fandral: Well, what then? Your lovely mortal is being guarded by a legion of our Einherjar who will see you coming from miles away.\
Thor: I won't be the one who comes for her. [Thor looks over to Sif; then we see Jane is sat in her guarded room when one of the guards enters]\
Jane Foster: I'm not hungry. [suddenly Sif comes up behind the guard and knocks him out, she looks over to Jane]\
Sif: Good, let's go. [Jane and Sif meet up with Thor with Loki standing beside him, Jane points to Loki]\
Jane Foster: You're...\
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard of... [suddenly Jane slaps Loki hard in the face]\
Jane Foster: That was for New York. [Loki smiles and looks at Thor]\
Loki: I like her. [back at Thor's meeting with his comrades]\
Sif: And what of the All-Father?\
Heimdall: It is my sworn duty to notify him of crimes against the throne. [Odin visits Heimdall accompanied by some of his guards]\
Odin: You called me here on an urgent matter. What is it?\
Heimdall: Treason, my lord.\
Odin: Whose?\
Heimdall: Mine. [Heimdall draws his sword, at the same time more guards interrupt them]\
Einherjar Lieutenant: My King, the mortal has been taken. [Odin looks at Heimdall as he commands his guards]\
Odin: Stop Thor, by any means necessary. [as they hear the guards approaching]\
Guards: There they are! Take them. On my command.\
Sif: I'll hold them off. Take her.\
Thor: Thank you. [Thor and Jane go off, as Loki goes to follow them Sif draws her sword and places it under Loki's throat]\
Sif: Betray him and I'll kill you. [Loki chuckles]\
Loki: It's good to see you too, Sif. [Loki leaves to join Thor and Jane as the guards get closer to Sif; back at the original meeting with Thor and his comrades]\
Volstagg: Assuming you can get Loki's help, and you can free this mortal, what good would it do? We'd all be dead the minute we step one foot outside the palace.\
Thor: That, my friend, is where we won't be leaving by foot. [Thor, Loki and Jane meet Volstagg where Malekith's ship had crashed into the palace]\
Volstagg: I will give you as much time as I can.\
[Thor and Volstagg do a forearm shake]\
\
Thor: Thank you, my friend. [as they walk towards Malekith's crashed ship, Jane smiles and nods at Volstagg, then as Loki is about to follow Thor and Jane Volstagg stops him]\
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him...\
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently there will be a line. [Volstagg then lets him pass] [Thor, Jane and Loki board Malekith's crashed ship, Thor looks at the controls and starts pressing some button, looking unsure of what he's doing] I thought you said you knew how to fly this thing.\
Thor: I said, "how hard could it be?" [meanwhile, the Asgardian guards rush towards the ship with Volstagg standing guard in front of it]\
Guard: They're on the ship!\
Loki: They're on the ship! [as they approach the ship Volstagg starts attacking them; back in the ship] Well, whatever you're doing, brother, I suggest you do it faster.\
Thor: Shut up, Loki. [outside the ship Volstagg continues to battle with the Asgardian guards; back in the ship Thor continues to frantically press every button to start the ship]\
Loki: You must have missed something.\
Thor: No, I didn't, I'm pressing every button on this thing.\
Loki: No, don't hit it, just press it gently. [as he hits the buttons]\
Thor: I am pressing it gently. It's not working! [suddenly the ship comes to life, Thor laughs; outside the ship Volstagg is overrun by the guards.]\
Guards: Get him! Get him!\
[Volstagg starts laughing as they watch the ship start to rise, hitting the columns of the palace]\
Loki: I think you missed a column.\
Thor: Shut up! [finally the ship breaks through the palace walls and takes off] [as they are flying through Asgard]\
Loki: Look, why don't you let me take over, I'm clearly the better pilot.\
Thor: Is that right? Well, out of the two of us which one can actually fly? [as they are flying over Asgard suddenly Jane collapses]\
Loki: Oh, dear. Is she dead?\
Thor: Jane. [Jane raises her head, looking weak]\
Jane Foster: I'm okay. [as they continue to fly, the ship hits and breaks off a part of a massive building; to Loki]\
Thor: Not a word. [several smaller Asgardian ships start following them]\
Loki: Now they're following us. [the smaller ships start firing at them] Now they're firing at us!\
Thor: Yeah, thank you for the commentary, Loki! It's not at all distracting! [the ship then hits a massive stone monument of King Bor, breaking the head off]\
Loki: Well done, you just decapitated your grandfather. [the smaller ships continue to follow and fire at them as they fly over Asgard] You know this is wonderful. This is a tremendous idea. Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that. Flying around the city, smashing into everything in sight so everyone can see us. It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant! [suddenly Thor pushes Loki off the ship, Thor then picks up Jane and jumps off the flying ship and lands onto a smaller ship being flown by Fandral, Loki has also fallen onto the ship]\
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeons has made you no less graceful, Loki. [the Asgardian ships above them continue to follow and fire at Malekith's ship as they think that Thor is still on there] [Thor lays Jane down]\
Loki: You lied to me. I'm impressed.\
Thor: I'm glad you're pleased. Now, do as you promised. Take us to your secret pathway. [Loki smiles and takes over the ship's control, at the same time the Asgardian ships spot them and start firing at them] Fandral.\
Fandral: Right. [Fandral picks up a rope and steps on to the edge of the ship] For Asgard. [suddenly he jumps off the ship and uses the rope to swing onto the Asgardian ship following them] Nothing personal, boys! [he knocks out the three guards on the ship then looks over to Thor and salutes him; on Fandral's ship Loki flies them towards the mountains]\
Thor: Loki!\
Loki: If it were easy everyone would do it.\
Thor: Are you mad?\
Loki: Possibly. [Thor holds on to Jane, as Loki heads straight for the wall of the mountain, suddenly they enter right through the mountain and then enter through a portal to Svartalfheim] Ta-da! [on their ship, Algrim approaches Malekith]\
Algrim: [subtitled] We must attack now.\
Malekith: [subtitled] No. Asgard is not important anymore. The Aether has returned home. [as they fly over Svartalfheim, Jane continues to lie down and Thor puts a cover over her]\
Loki: [sighs] What I could do with the power that flows through those veins.\
Thor: It would consume you.\
Loki: She's holding up alright, for now.\
Thor: She's strong in ways you'd never even know.\
Loki: Say goodbye.\
Thor: Not this day.\
Loki: This day, the next, a hundred years, it's nothing. It's a heart beat. You'll never be ready. The only woman whose love you've prized will be snatched from you.\
Thor: And will that satisfy you?\
Loki: Satisfaction is not in my nature.\
Thor: Surrender not in mine.\
Loki: The son of Odin.\
Thor: No, not just of Odin! You think you alone were loved of mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\
Loki: Trust. Was that her last expression? Trust? When you let her die!\
Thor: What help were you in your cell?\
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?! [Thor grabs hold of Loki]\
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [Thor raises his fist to punch Loki but stops himself] She wouldn't want us to fight.\
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked. [they both smile]\
Thor: I wish I could trust you. [Thor turns his back to Loki]\
Loki: Trust my rage. [back on Earth, Darcy and Ian go to free Erik from the mental institution]\
Desk Officer: You'll have to sign for your father's belongings, Mr. Selvig. [Ian looks distracted and Darcy nudges him to bring him to attention]\
Ian Boothby: What? Oh, yeah. My father, Dr. Erik Selvig. [Ian goes to sign the form]\
Desk Officer: One; a man's leather wallet, brown. One key ring with three keys. Prescription medicine. [he places the, wallet, key ring with the keys and a plastic bag containing medicine bottles on the counter] Various. [the officer then bends to pick up another item from behind the counter, at the same time Darcy notices Erik being escorted towards them]\
Darcy Lewis: Erik.\
Desk Officer: And... [the officer places Erik's gadgets on the counter] These.\
Ian Boothby: Yeah, those. Thank goodness. [as Erik comes towards Darcy]\
Darcy Lewis: Erik.\
Erik Selvig: Yes?\
Darcy Lewis: It's uh...Darcy.\
Erik Selvig: Darcy. [Darcy holds up her hands and smiles, Erik then hugs her] It's so good to see you.\
Darcy Lewis: Uh...I missed you too. [Darcy looks awkward as Erik continues to hold her tightly]\
Erik Selvig: How did you find me?\
Ian Boothby: You were naked on TV.\
Darcy Lewis: Okay, time to go. Lots to do. [Erik continues to hold her] Getting weird now. [as they walk down the corridor of the mental institution with Ian holding Erik's gadgets] I should not be left in charge of stuff like this, I don't get paid enough. I don't get paid period. [Erik takes his bag of medicine from Ian]\
Ian Boothby: I'm uh...Ian by the way. Uh..Darcy's intern. I don't get paid either. [Ian watches as Erik takes out a bottle of pills] Are you alright?\
Erik Selvig: I have had a God in my brain. I don't recommend it. [as they step out of the building suddenly the gadget in Ian arms starts to beep]\
Ian Boothby: Dr. Selvig, your gear is beeping at me.\
Erik Selvig: It's happening, sooner than I calculated.\
Darcy Lewis: Wait, what's happening? [they look up to see flock of birds flying above them] Birds? Birds are happening?\
Ian Boothby: They're starlings, it's called a murmuration. My dad used to take me bird watching as a kid.\
Darcy Lewis: Erik?\
Erik Selvig: Look. [suddenly the birds all fly in the same direction and they all suddenly disappear]\
Darcy Lewis: Where did they go? [suddenly all the birds appear behind, them flying away frantically making Darcy screams in terror] What the hell was that?! [Erik smiles] Why are you smiling?\
Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are. [he walks ahead and throws his bag of medicine into the garbage bin nearby] Take me to Jane's lab! [on Svartalfheim, as they continue flying on their ship suddenly Jane's eyes open, it's clear that the Aether has taken her over, she rises and looks ahead]\
Thor: Jane.\
Jane Foster: Malekith. [after landing their ship, they walk over to watch Malekith and his men in the distance]\
Thor: Alright, are you ready? [Jane nods her head]\
Loki: I am. [they rise from their hiding spot and Malekith spots them standing on a hill in the distance] You know this plan of yours is going to get us killed.\
Thor: Yeah, possibly. [Loki holds up his shackled hands for Thor to uncuff him]\
Loki: You still don't trust me, brother?\
Thor: Would you? [Thor takes off Loki's cuffs]\
Loki: No, I wouldn't. [suddenly Loki takes out a dagger stabs Thor and throws him down the hill]\
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Malekith sees this and starts walking towards them] [after stabbing Thor and throwing him down the hill, Loki walks over to Thor]\
Loki: You really think I cared about Frigga, about any of you? [he kicks Thor in the stomach] All I ever wanted was you and Odin dead at my feet! [Thor raises his hand, attempting to summon Mjolnir, but Loki cuts off his hand making Thor scream out in pain, Jane rushes over to Thor but Loki grabs her and turns to face Malekith and his dark elves] Malekith, I am Loki of Jotunheim and I bring you a gift! [he throws Jane at Malekith's feet] I ask only one thing in return, a good seat from which to watch Asgard burn.\
Algrim: [to Malekith] [subtitled] He is an enemy of Asgard, he was locked in a cell. [Malekith walks over to Thor squirming in pain on the ground]\
Malekith: Look at me. [Malekith uses his foot to turn Thor, he then lifts Jane in the air and extracts the Aether from her, in that moment Jane has a vision of Earth, then as the Aether leaves her body Jane falls to the ground]\
Thor: Loki, now! [Loki uses his diversion tactics and we see that he had never amputated Thor's hand, Thor quickly summons Mjolnir and shoots lightning at the Aether attempting to destroy it, but he fails as Malekith is still able to absorb it and turns to leave on his ship] [two of the dark elves start attacking Thor but he quickly takes them down, Algrim then throws one of his vortex weapons in the air, Loki pushes Jane away and he is nearly sucked in when Thor pulls him out, Thor then attacks Algrim but he beats Thor down, Loki goes over to them and impales Algrim from behind, Algrim slowly turns and suddenly pulls Loki into the blade that is sticking out from him] No! [Algrim takes a step towards Loki]\
Loki: See you in hell, monster! [Algrim then realizes that attached to the blade in him is his own vortex weapon, it explodes before he can do anything destroying him; Thor then rushes over to Loki]\
Thor: No. No, no, no! Oh, you fool, you didn't listen!\
Loki: I know. I'm a fool. I'm a fool! [Loki squirms in pain]\
Thor: Stay with me, okay?\
Loki: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\
Thor: Shh.\
Loki: I'm sorry.\
Thor: It's okay. [Thor nods his head] It's alright. I'll tell father what you did here today.\
Loki: I didn't do it for him. [he closes his eyes and as he dies his skin turns to it's blue Frost Giant form, Thor cries out in anguish]\
Thor: No! [Thor looks at Jane as he weeps for Loki] [after Loki's death, Thor and Jane enter a cave as they see a storm approaching]\
Jane Foster: He's gonna unleash it, not just on Asgard or on a star, Malekith is gonna destroy everything.\
Thor: How? Jane, how?\
Jane Foster: I saw him on Earth. Why would he go to Earth?\
Thor: The Convergence.\
Jane Foster: Oh, God. None of this would have happened if I hadn't found the Aether.\
Thor: Then Malekith would have only possessed it that much sooner.\
Jane Foster: I only found it because I was looking for you.\
Thor: Jane. [he places his hand on her face]\
Jane Foster: Now we're trapped here. [suddenly they hear music playing, Jane and Thor look at each other in confusion]\
Thor: It's not me. [Jane realizes it's her cell phone, she takes it out of her pocket and answers it]\
Jane Foster: Hello?\
Richard: Hi, Jane, it's Richard.\
Jane Foster: Richard?! Where are you?\
Richard: I'm still in the office. It's...It's been a crazy day here today. [Jane puts him on speaker and holds up her phone]\
Jane Foster: Oh, my God! This is amazing.\
Richard: Is it? I quite enjoyed our lunch despite never actually ordering anything.\
Jane Foster: How am I getting service here?\
Richard: Is this a bad time? Do you want me to try you there?\
Jane Foster: No, no, no, no! Please, whatever you do, do not hang up the phone.\
Richard: Okay then. I was just wondering if you want to try again? Uh...maybe dinner next time.\
Jane Foster: Uh...yeah, yeah, yeah. Um...just stay on the phone, okay?\
Richard: Yeah, I will. [Jane looks down and notices can and keys that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\
Jane Foster: Oh, my God. [Jane picks up the keys from the floor of the cave]\
Richard: Am I interrupting something.\
Jane Foster: No, no, no, nothing at all. [realizing how they can return to Earth, Jane turns to Thor] Come on.\
Richard: I'm losing you there, are you in a tunnel? [Thor starts following Jane]\
Thor: Where are we going?\
Richard: [to Jane] Hello? [they start walking further into the cave, Thor notices the discarded shoes that were thrown through from the abandoned factory]\
Thor: Why are there so many shoes in here? [as they walks further in suddenly they disappear; back in his office Richard loses Jane on the phone]\
Richard: I'll just text her. [Jane and Thor appear back on Earth outside the factory, they get into Ian's abandoned car still parked outside the factory and Jane tries to start the car]\
Darcy Lewis: Jane!\
Jane Foster: Hey.\
Darcy Lewis: You can't just leave like that, the whole world is going crazy! [Thor hangs his hammer on the coat hanger next to the door] All the stuff we saw is spreading. [she looks at Jane's Asgardian clothes and disheveled state] Did you go to a party? [Jane notices Erik for the first time]\
Jane Foster: Erik?!\
Erik Selvig: Jane, how wonderful! [he rises and goes to Jane and as he embraces her we see he isn't wearing any pants] You've been to Asgard.\
Jane Foster: Where are your pants?\
Ian Boothby: Oh, uh...he uh...he says it helps him think.\
Jane Foster: Okay. Well, I'm gonna need everything you got on this. All the work you've been doing on gravimetric anomalies, everything.\
Erik Selvig: Okay.\
Thor: Are you well, Erik? [Erik chuckles then his smile fades quickly]\
Erik Selvig: Your brother is not coming, is he?\
Thor: Loki is dead.\
Erik Selvig: Oh, thank God. [Thor looks at him in confusion] I...I'm so sorry.\
Thor: Thank you. [Erik then embraces Thor] [back on Svartalfheim we see an Einherjar Guard use the ship that brought Thor, Loki and Jane onto the planet to return to Asgard, he goes to see Odin at the palace]\
Einherjar Guard: Forgive me, my liege. I've returned from the Dark World with news.\
Odin: Thor?\
Einherjar Guard: There's no sign of Thor, or the weapon, but... [he takes a step closer to Odin]\
Odin: What?\
Einherjar Guard: We found a body. [there's a moment's pause]\
Odin: Loki. [the warrior doesn't reply but just looks at Odin] [back at Jane's apartment]\
Jane Foster: Malekith is going to fire the Aether at a spot where all the nine worlds are connected.\
Erik Selvig: Amplifying the weapon's impact. With each additional world, the power will increase exponentially. The effect would be universal.\
Thor: Yes, well the alignment is only temporary. He must be in exactly at the right place at the right time.\
Darcy Lewis: Well, how do we know where that is?\
Erik Selvig: We follow the directions. This has happened before, thousands of years ago, and The Ancients were there to see it. [Erik places a map of the British Isles on the coffee table] All the great constructions: the Mayas, the Chinese, the Egyptians, they made use of the gravitational effects of the Convergence. And they left us a map. [he starts drawing on the map] Stonehenge. Snowdon, the Great Orme. These are all coordinates taking us...here. [he points to Greenwich on the map]\
Ian Boothby: Greenwich?\
Jane Foster: The walls between worlds will be almost non-existent. Physics is gonna go ballistic. Increase and decrease in gravity, spatial extrusions. The very fabric of reality is gonna be torn apart. [Thor summons Mjolnir and it shoots over to Thor's hand from the where it was hanging on the coat hanger]\
Erik Selvig: I better get my pants. [in Greenwich at the location outside a library Darcy and Ian grab Erik's gadget]\
Darcy Lewis: Focus, this is important. We have to hammer them in all around the site and then Jane and Erik will activate them from the tower.\
Ian Boothby: They're taped together!\
Darcy Lewis: Do you even know what these things do?\
Ian Boothby: No.\
Darcy Lewis: Neither do I. [Darcy and Ian start placing Erik's gadgets around the library grounds] Come on, come on!\
Ian Boothby: Fine! [suddenly Malekith's giant ship appears on the River Thames near the library grounds]\
Darcy Lewis: Holy shit! [the ship starts moving forward and crashing through the library grounds causing pandemonium until it finally stops in the middle of the grounds, Malekith and his dark elves step off the ship and the same time Thor flies in and lands in front of Malekith]\
Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian! Death would have come to you soon enough.\
Thor: Not by your hand!\
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be extinguished. [Malekith uses the power of the Aether to attack Thor but Thor manages to narrowly miss getting hit by it] [inside the library setting up the gravimetric device]\
Erik Selvig: We're running out of time.\
Jane Foster: Almost there.\
Erik Selvig: Are you sure this is going to work? These devices were made to detect anomalies, not cause them.\
Jane Foster: Oh, come on. [Jane looks out and sees Thor and Malekith battling it out] Come on, Darcy. [Jane rushes off to find Darcy; outside Thor manages to deflect the Aether that Malekith is using to fight him off]\
Thor: You know with all that power, I thought you would hit harder. [as Malekith is using the Aether to shield himself suddenly Thor throws his hammer at him which throws Malekith across the ground and smashes him against the library building, at the same time Jane sees Darcy and Ian placing the last of Erik's device in the ground]\
Ian Boothby: Done. [Darcy gives the OK sign to Jane and Jane rushes back to Erik]\
Erik Selvig: The Convergence will be in full effect in seven minutes.\
Jane Foster: That just means we have to keep Malekith busy for eight. [Jane gets the device ready] Okay, you might wanna hold on to something. [she turns on the device and suddenly some of the dark elves suddenly disappear; Darcy and Ian watch this nearby, Darcy talks to Jane on her phone]\
Darcy Lewis: That is awesome! How did you do that?\
Jane Foster: Well, gravitational fields interact with the weak spot between worlds creating...\
Darcy Lewis: Oh, there's a guy with a sword! [Jane uses the device again to make the dark elf disappear but instead she accidentally makes Darcy and Ian disappear]\
Jane Foster: Oops.\
Erik Selvig: Let's go. [Darcy and Ian appear in another part of London]\
Darcy Lewis: What the hell just happened? [suddenly the dark elves that had also disappeared appear and fall onto a parked car] Move! [Darcy grabs hold of Ian's hand and they run off as the dark elves start chasing after them; back at the library Thor and Malekith continue their battle and everyone inside the library rushes to the windows to watch]\
Jane Foster: What are you all doing? You need to get out of here! Now!\
Student: You're joking, right? That's Thor out there waving his hammer around and everything! [he uses his phone to record the battle outside; in their ensuing fight, Thor and Malekith are transported through the realms to Svartalfheim and London continuously, at the same time a fighter jet flies towards Malekith's ship]\
Control: Confirming ship is hostile.\
Pilot: Confirm, the ship is hostile. You have permission to engage.\
Control: Roger. The missile's locked. The missile's on its way. [the pilot releases the missile] Missile off target! I repeat...\
Pilot: Mayday! I'm losing control. Mayday! Mayday! I'm losing control! [the jet is then transported to Valaheim] [as they run through the library ground]\
Erik Selvig: What are you doing?\
Jane Foster: My signal's lost connection. [some of the dark elves are behind them chasing after them]\
Erik Selvig: Jane! Come on! [as Thor and Malekith continue their battle through the realms they land in Jotunheim and are confronted by a giant beast which then is transported to London, at the same time Darcy and Ian are being ambushed by the dark elves when Ian, with the help of the anti-gravitational energy force, grabs a car and throws it at them, Darcy looks at him in shock]\
Ian Boothby: Are you alright?\
Darcy Lewis: You saved my life.\
Ian Boothby: Yeah. Yes, I did. [back at the library grounds Jane manages to make the device work again and as she uses it suddenly makes Darcy and Ian appear behind her in each others arms kissing]\
Jane Foster: Darcy?\
Darcy Lewis: Jane! [Darcy lets go of Ian and falls to the ground]\
Erik Selvig: Ian?\
Ian Boothby: Selvig! [suddenly Mjolnir appears and flies past them]\
Darcy Lewis: Meowmeow! [Thor and Malekith are then transported through the realms again with Malekith landing back in Greenwich but Thor ends up in Charing Cross Underground Station]\
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\
[Thor turns to one of the passengers on the underground train that's just arrived]\
Thor: How do I get to Greenwich?\
Woman on Train: Take this train, three stops. [Thor steps onto the train and places his hand on the bar above him]\
Man: [over speakers] Mind the gap.\
[as the train starts to move, the movement causes the woman to fall against Thor and she stops herself by placing her hand on his chest]\
Woman on Train: Sorry. Sorry. [Thor smiles politely at her]\
[in Greenwich the realms come closer to converging, Malekith readies the Aether within him to bring forth the darkness]\
Jane Foster: We're out of time. [Jane rushes off ahead]\
Erik Selvig: Jane. Jane! [Thor rushes out of the station to watch the Aether taking over]\
Jane Foster: Thor! We're too late.\
Erik Selvig: The Convergence is at its peak. [Thor looks at the gadget spears in Erik's hand]\
Thor: Can those things stop him?\
Erik Selvig: Not from here.\
Jane Foster: We can't get close enough. [Thor looks at Jane]\
Thor: I can. [Thor takes the spears from Erik and rushes off towards Malekith] [Thor pushes through the Aether and reaches Malekith] Malekith! [Malekith turns to face Thor]\
Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?\
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender. [Thor throws one of Erik's gadget spears at Malekith and he catches it, Jane uses the gavemetric which makes his arm disappear and we see it transported to Svartalfheim, Thor throws the other spear at Malekith and he catches it and his other arm disappears]\
Malekith: You think you can stop this? The Aether cannot be destroyed.\
Thor: But you can. [Thor summons Mjolnir at the same time he rushes towards Malekith and as he grabs his hammer he uses it to throw Malekith into his ship and Jane is able to use her device to transport him Svartalfheim] [after Thor kills Malekith Jane goes to find Thor and finds him lying on the ground, suddenly Malekith's ship starts to crumble, Jane rushes towards the unconscious Thor]\
Jane Foster: Thor! No! [Jane turns Thor over grabs his arm and starts to pull him out of the way but he is too heavy, just them Erik, Darcy and Ian arrive on the scene]\
Erik Selvig: Jane! [the ship starts to fall, as Jane is not able to move Thor she throws herself on top of him and holds on to him with her eyes closed, just as the ship is about to land on them it disappears and appears on Svartalfheim landing on Malekith and crushing him to death; back in Greenwich] Everybody okay? [Thor becomes conscious and opens his eyes, Darcy smiles and throws her arms around Ian and kisses him passionately] [couple of days later, Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian are in her apartment sat having breakfast quietly]\
Darcy Lewis: He's gonna come back. Except, you know, last time he was gone for, like, two years.\
Jane Foster: Well, it's only been two days, so...\
Erik Selvig: Did he say anything before he left?\
Jane Foster: Yeah, he had to figure some stuff out with his father. He kind of committed treason... on our way out. [Jane looks away and carries on eating her breakfast]\
Erik Selvig: Oh.\
[On Asgard Thor meets with Odin at the palace]\
Odin: You once said there would never be a wiser King than me. You were wrong. The alignment has brought all the realms together. Every one of them saw you offer your life to save them. What can Asgard offer its new King in return?\
Thor: My life. Father, I cannot be King of Asgard. I will protect Asgard and all the realms with my last and every breath, but I cannot do so from that chair. Loki, for all his grave imbalance, understood rule as I know I never will. The brutality, the sacrifice, it changes you. I'd rather be a good man than a great King.\
Odin: Is this my son I hear, or the woman he loves?\
Thor: When you speak, do I never hear Mother's voice? [Odin sighs] This is not for Jane, Father. She does not know what I came here to say. Now forbid me to see her or say she can rule at my side, it changes nothing.\
Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?\
Thor: Loki died with honor, I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [Odin nods his head, Thor then holds up Mjolnir to offer it back to Odin]\
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.\
Thor: I shall try to be.\
Odin: I cannot give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.\
Thor: I know. [Thor turns to leave]\
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son had become, even that I could not say. It would speak only from my heart. Go, my son. [Thor smiles]\
Thor: Thank you, father. [he turns and starts walking off, as Odin watches Thor walk off Odin's form transform to reveal Loki]\
Loki: No. Thank you. [Loki smiles devilishly] [mid-credits scene; Sif and Volstagg are taken to meet, The Collector Taneleer Tivan]\
Collector's Assistant: I present to you, Taneleer Tivan, The Collector.\
The Collector: Woh, Oh. Asgardians, it's an honor. [he bows theatrically]\
Sif: You know why we're here.\
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure in your own vault?\
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It's not wise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.\
The Collector: That's very wise. [Sif hands the Aether over to The Collector] I can assure you it will be absolutely safe in...in my collection.\
Sif: See that it is. [The Collector bows his head, Sif and Volstagg turn and leave]\
The Collector: One down, five to go. [after credits scene; at her apartment Jane, Erik, Darcy and Ian hear the sounds of thunder, Jane looks out and smiles as she sees lightning, Jane walks out onto her balcony as Thor appears, they embrace and start kissing passionately; at the same time we see the beast transported from Jotunheim running amok outside the abandoned factory]\
[Thor arrives to provide backup to Sif and the Warriors Three]\
Sif: I've got this completely under control!\
Thor: Is that why everything's on fire?\
. . .\
[the marauders bring out a rock monster to battle Thor]\
Sif: All yours. [steps back]\
Thor: Hello. [the beast roars] I accept your surrender.\
[the marauders roar with laughter; Thor uppercuts the beast with Mjolnir, reducing it to a pile of rubble]\
Thor: Anyone else?\
Loki: [mock salute to Odin] I really don't see what all the fuss is about\'85\
Odin: Do you not truly feel the gravity of your crimes? Wherever you go there is war, ruin and death!\
Loki: I went down to Midgard to rule the people of Earth as a benevolent God, just like you.\
Odin: We are not gods. We're born, we live, we die, just as humans do.\
Loki: Give or take five thousand years.\
Odin: All this because Loki desires a throne...\
Loki: It is my birthright!\
Odin: Your birthright was to DIE! As a child, cast out on a frozen rock. If I had not taken you in, you would not be here now, to hate me.\
Loki: If I'm for the axe, then for mercy's sake, just swing it. It's not that I don't like our little talks, it's just... I don't love them.\
Odin: Frigga is the only reason you're still alive, and you will never see her again. You'll spend the rest of your days in the dungeons.\
Loki: And what of Thor? You'll make that witless oaf King while I rot in chains?\
Odin: Thor must strive to undo the damage you have done. He will bring order to the Nine Realms, and then, yes, he will be King.\
Darcy: Come on, this is exciting. Look! The intern is excited.\
Ian: Ian, my name's Ian.\
Darcy: Do you want the phase meter?\
Jane: No.\
Darcy: Bring the phase meter. The toaster looking thing.\
Ian: Yeah. I know what the phase meter is.\
[Thor and Jane reunite]\
Thor: Jane?\
[she walks up to him and slaps him]\
Jane Foster: Sorry. I just\'85needed to make sure you were real. It's been a very strange day.\
Thor: I am. Jane\'97\
[she slaps him again]\
Jane: Where were you?!\
Thor: Where were you? Heimdall could not see you.\
Jane: I was right here where you left me! I was waiting, and then I was crying, and then I went out looking for you. You said you were coming back.\
Thor: I know. I know, but the Bifr\'f6st was destroyed. The Nine Realms erupted into chaos. Wars were raging, marauders were pillaging\'85I had to put an end to the slaughter.\
[she looks at him blankly for a moment]\
Jane: As excuses go, it's not\'85terrible\'85But I saw you on TV! You were in New York!\
Thor: Jane, I fought to protect you from the dangers of my world, but I was wrong. I was a fool. I believe that fate brought us together.\
[they embrace]\
Malekith: [looking out over the ruins of Svartalfheim] Look upon my legacy, Algrim. I can barely remember a time before the light.\
Algrim: Our survival will be your legacy.\
Malekith: The Asgardians will suffer as we have suffered. I will reclaim the Aether. I will restore our world. And I will put an end to this poisoned universe.\
Odin: She does not belong in Asgard any more than a goat belongs at a banquet!\
Jane: Did he just-? Who do you think you are?\
Odin: I am Odin. King of Asgard. Protector of the Nine Realms.\
Jane: Oh. Well I'm-\
Odin: I know very well who you are, Jane Foster.\
Jane: [to Thor] You told your dad about me?\
Frigga: You know full well it was your actions that brought you here.\
Loki: My actions? I was merely giving truth to the lie that I had been fed my entire life\'85that I was born to be a king.\
Frigga: A king? A true king admits his faults. What of the lives you took on Earth?\
Loki: A mere handful compared to the number that Odin has taken himself.\
Frigga: Your father\'97\
Loki: He's not my father!\
Frigga: Then am I not your mother?\
Loki: You're not.\
Frigga: [looks hurt but chuckles] You're always so perceptive about everyone but yourself. [Loki looks sorry and reaches for her but she disappears]\
[Malekith bursts into Frigga's chamber, hunting for Jane]\
Frigga: Stand down, creature, and you may still survive this.\
Malekith: I have survived worse, woman.\
Frigga: Who are you?\
Malekith: I am Malekith... [looks at Jane] and I would have what is mine. [They both draw swords and duel, until Algrim arrives and helps overpower Frigga. Malekith turns to confront Jane] You have taken something, child. Give it back. [Malekith discovers Jane is an illusion and angrily faces a grinning Frigga] WITCH! Where is the Aether?!\
Frigga: I'll never tell you.\
Malekith: I believe you. [Algrim kills Frigga]\
Loki: Thor. After all this time and now you come to visit me. Why? Have you come to gloat? To mock?\
Thor: Loki, enough. No more illusions. [Loki and the neat room turn to a destroyed room with Loki looking disheveled on the floor]\
Loki: Now you see me, brother. Did she suffer? [referring to Frigga]\
Thor: I did not come here to share our grief. Instead, I offer you the chance of a far richer sacrament.\
Loki: Go on.\
Thor: I know you seek vengeance as much as I do. You help me escape Asgard, and I will grant it to you. Vengeance. And afterward, this cell.\
Loki: [chuckles] You must be truly desperate to come to me for help. What makes you think you can trust me?\
Thor: I don't. Mother did. You should know that when we fought each other in the past, I did so with a glimmer of hope that my brother was still in there somewhere. That hope no longer exists to protect you. You betray me, and I will kill you.\
Loki: Hm. When do we start?\
[Jane meets Loki]\
Jane: You're\'85\
Loki: I'm Loki. You may have heard\'97\
[she hauls off and slaps him]\
Jane: That was for New York!\
Loki: [to Thor] I like her.\
. . .\
Sif: Betray him, and I'll kill you.\
Loki: Good to see you too, Sif.\
. . .\
Volstagg: If you even think about betraying him\'85\
Loki: You'll kill me? Evidently, there will be a line.\
Loki: You know, this is wonderful! This a tremendous idea! Let's steal the biggest, most obvious ship in the universe and escape in that! Flying around the city, smash it into everything in sight so everyone can see us! It's brilliant, Thor! It's truly brilliant- [Thor shoves Loki out of the ship, and jumps out with Jane in his arms into a skiff piloted by Fandral]\
Fandral: [laughs] I see your time in the dungeon has made you no less graceful, Loki!\
Loki: [to Thor] You lied to me. I'm impressed.\
Loki: [steering the skiff towards a tiny crevice in the mountain] If it were easy, everyone would do it.\
Thor: Are you mad?\
Loki: Possibly.\
Thor: You think you alone were loved of Mother? You had her tricks, but I had her trust!\
Loki: Trust? Was that her last expression, trust? While you let her die?!\
Thor: What good were you in your cell?\
Loki: Who put me there? Who put me there?!\
Thor: You know damn well! You know damn well who! [pins Loki and is about to hit him but lets him go] She wouldn't want us to fight.\
Loki: Well, she wouldn't exactly be shocked.\
Thor: [chuckles] I wish I could trust you.\
Loki: [whispers] Trust my rage.\
Thor: [holding a dying Loki] I will tell Father what you did here today.\
Loki: I didn't do it for him.\
[a flock of birds disappears into thin air, then reappears flying out of the ground near Ian, Darcy, and Dr. Selvig]\
Darcy: What the hell was that? [to a grinning Dr. Selvig] Why are you smiling?\
Dr. Erik Selvig: There's nothing more reassuring than realizing that the world is crazier than you are.\
Malekith: You needn't have come so far, Asgardian. Death would have come to you soon enough.\
Thor: Not by your hand!\
Malekith: Your universe was never meant to be. Your world and your family will be EXTINGUISHED!\
Malekith: Darkness returns, Asgardian. Have you come to witness the end of your universe?\
Thor: I've come to accept your surrender.\
Malekith: You think you can stop this?! The Aether cannot be destroyed!\
Thor: But you can. [summons Mjolnir and deals the final blow to Malekith]\
Odin: One son who wanted the throne too much, and another who will not take it. Is this my legacy?\
Thor: Loki died with honour. I shall try to live the same. Is that not legacy enough? [offers the hammer]\
Odin: It belongs to you, if you are worthy of it.\
Thor: I shall try to be.\
Odin: I can not give you my blessing, nor can I wish you good fortune.\
Thor: I know. [turns to leave]\
Odin: If I were proud of the man my son has become, even that I could not say, it would speak only from my heart. Go, my son.\
Thor: Thank you, Father. [leaves]\
Loki: [appears from Odin's guise] No... thank you.\
[mid credits scene; Sif and Volstagg arrive in an alien collection]\
Carina: I present to you Taneleer Tivan. The Collector.\
[the Collector, looking like an alien Liberace, appears and bows]\
The Collector: Asgardians! It's an honor.\
Sif: You know why we're here. [she hands him the Aether, which he accepts]\
The Collector: Of course. But if I may ask, why not keep it secure, in your own vault?\
Volstagg: The Tesseract is already on Asgard. It would be unwise to keep two Infinity Stones so close together.\
The Collector: That's very wise. I can assure you, it will be absolutely safe here in my collection.\
Sif: See that it is.\
[the Asgardians leave]\
The Collector: One down\'85five to go.\
\
[Adrian Toomes and his coworker, Phineas Mason, are studying a child's drawing of the Avengers.]\
\
Toomes: Things are never gonna be the same now. I mean, look at this. You got aliens. You got big green guys tearing down buildings. When I was a kid, I used to draw cowboys and Indians.\
\
Mason: Actually, it's Native American, but whatever.\
\
Toomes: Yeah. Tell you what, though. It ain't bad, is it?\
\
[Toomes squints at the drawing and Mason nods.]\
\
Mason: No. Yeah. Kid's got a future.\
\
Toomes: Yeah, well... We'll see, I guess.\
\
[Toomes looks up at the damaged Avengers Tower. Helicopters pass overhead. Scaffolding covers the tower's lower floors. A roving view sends us into a ruined building across the street.]\
[A clean-up crew works around a giant deceased Chitauri alien creature with pointed teeth. Alien artifacts lie among the rubble. Walking through the site, Toomes gives a worker a thumbs up. He turns to Herman Schultz, who is one of his workers.]\
\
Toomes: No, hey! Uh-uh! You can't saw through that stuff. These alien bastards are tough. You gotta use the stuff they use.\
\
[He picks up an alien object from the ground and uses it as a tool to break down the Chitauri chariot.]\
\
Toomes: See?\
\
Schultz: All right.\
\
Toomes: All right. (to Brice) Oh, hey! Glad you could join us. Afternoon.\
\
Brice: Yeah. My alarm didn't go off.\
\
Toomes: Yeah, yeah, yeah, your alarm. Look, just go stack that armor plating like I asked you. This is a huge deal for us.\
\
[Anne Marie Hoag, the director of the Department of Damage Control, walks into the salvage site with her crew.]\
\
Anne Marie Hoag: Attention, please! In accordance with Executive Order 396B, all post-battle cleanup operations are now under our jurisdiction. Thank you for your service. We'll take it from here.\
\
Toomes: Who the hell are you?\
\
DODC Agent: Qualified personnel.\
\
Toomes: Look, I have a city contract to salvage all this, okay, with the city, so-\
\
Anne Marie Hoag: I apologize, Mr. Toomes, but all salvage operations are now under our jurisdiction. Please turn over any and all exotic materials that you've collected, or you will be prosecuted.\
\
[The workers look puzzled. A worker slips an alien artifact that looks like a power source into his pocket unnoticed.]\
\
Toomes: Ma'am, what am I- Please. Come here. Hey, lady, come on. Look... I bought trucks for this job. I brought in a whole new crew. These guys have a family. I have a family. I'm all in on this. I could lose my house.\
\
Anne Marie Hoag: I'm sorry, sir. There's nothing I can do.\
\
[Toomes is left to stare at her back as she leaves. Behind him, a Damage Control Agent speaks up.]\
\
DODC Agent: Maybe next time, don't over extend yourself.\
\
[Toomes looks around and grins.]\
\
Toomes: What'd you say?\
\
[He looks around at his crew of workers. Brice whistles.]\
\
Toomes: Yeah, he's right. I overextended myself.\
\
[Suddenly, he punches the agent. The agents point their guns at him.]\
\
Worker: Don't do it.\
\
Anne Marie Hoag: Put them down.\
\
[The agents lower their guns.]\
\
Anne Marie Hoag: If you have a grievance, you may take it up with my superiors.\
\
Toomes: Your superiors. Who the hell are they?\
\
[We see a TV screen playing the news about Tony Stark and his contract with Damage Control. Toomes watches the TV with an angry look on his face.]\
\
News Anchor: A joint venture between Stark Industries and the federal government, the Department of Damage Control will oversee the collection and storage of alien and other exotic materials.\
\
Schultz: So now the assholes who made this mess are being paid to clean it up.\
\
Mason: Yeah, it\'92s all rigged.\
\
[Mason is tinkering with the alien power source that one of the workers stole from the salvage site earlier that day.]\
\
News Anchor: Experts estimate there are over fifteen hundred tons of exotic material scattered throughout the tri-state area.\
\
[The glowing alien artifact is now connected to a motor with wires. The blades on the motor start to spin and the machine floats off the table. One of the workers pulls off a tarpaulin sheet covering a large piece of Chitauri artifact, revealing a dozen of glowing Chitauri energy cores.]\
\
Worker: Hey, chief! We still have another load from yesterday. We\'92re supposed to turn this in, right?\
\
Brice: I ain\'92t hauling it.\
\
Mason: It\'92s too bad. We could have made some pretty cool stuff from all that alien junk.\
\
[Toomes stares at the truck full of alien items and makes up his mind.]\
\
Toomes: I tell you what, let\'92s keep it. The world\'92s changing.\
\
[Mason lifts his magnifying goggles and looks at his boss.]\
\
Toomes: It\'92s time we change, too.\
\
8 YEARS LATER\
\
[The Rolling Stones\'92 \'93Can\'92t You Hear Me Knocking\'94 is playing in the warehouse. Workers are moving piles of alien tech and tinkering with machines. Mason works on an elaborate rifle gun. Another worker fires a neon blast from an exotic gun. The blast shears a large item in half. Workers load piles of high tech weapons onto a van.]\
\
[Cash pours through a money counting machine.]\
\
[A figure wearing a flying suit with expensive metal wings soars toward the warehouse. Doors in the ceiling open and the figure drops crates of alien tech from the suits\'92 claw-like feet. The helmeted figure comes through the roof and lands on the platform. He steps out of the wing suit and faces Mason.]\
\
Toomes: There you go, Mason.\
\
[The helmet opens, revealing Toomes. Mason grins.]\
\
Toomes: Business is good.\
\
a Film by Peter Parker\
\
[Through a small, rectangular screen, we see the scenery of New York passing by at a high velocity. We seem to be on a highway.]\
\
Peter: (in a gravelly voice) New York. Queens. It\'92s a rough borough, but hey, it\'92s home.\
\
Happy: Who are you talking to?\
\
[Camera quickly pans to reveal Happy Hogan driving in the front seat.]\
\
Peter: (in a normal voice) No one. Just making a little video of the trip.\
\
Happy: You know you can\'92t show it to anyone.\
\
Peter: Yeah, I know.\
\
Happy: Then why are you narrating in that voice?\
\
Peter: Uh... Because it\'92s fun.\
\
Happy: Fun.\
\
[Apparently, Happy thinks this whole situation is the opposite of fun. He puts on his sunglasses and solemnly looks out the windshield.]\
\
Peter: So, uh, why do they call you Happy?\
\
[Happy raises the limo\'92s partition. We see a reflection of Peter Parker holding up his phone and filming.]\
\
[Peter gets out of the car to find a small private plane waiting for him.]\
\
Happy: Come on. I\'92m not carrying your bags. Let\'92s go.\
\
Peter: Hey, should I go to the bathroom before?\
\
Happy: There\'92s a bathroom on it.\
\
[Inside the plane, we see a view of the cockpit. Two seats for the pilot and the copilot are there no one is sitting in them.]\
\
Peter: Whoa. No pilot? That\'92s awesome.\
\
[Peter sits down across from Happy, directly facing him.]\
\
Happy: Is that where you\'92re gonna sit?\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Happy: This is your first time on a private plane?\
\
Peter: My first time on any plane.\
\
[Happy moves away to sit in another seat.]\
\
Peter: Should it...? Should it be...? Should it be making that noise?\
\
[Later. Peter puts a finger to his lips and makes a shushing sound.]\
\
Peter: Shh.\
\
[Camera reveals Happy snoring. At the sound of Peter\'92s chuckle, Happy jerks awake, causing the whole frame to shake.]\
\
[Inside Berlin Brandenburg Airport, we see German signs, Happy dragging his luggage behind him, and Peter\'92s face in quick succession.]\
\
[Peter is sightseeing Berlin. We see Berlin streets, the Brandenburg Gate, a street performer, foreign girls, and a pretzel vendor.]\
\
Peter: No one has actually told me why I\'92m in Berlin or what I\'92m doing. Something about Captain America going crazy.\
\
[Happy and Peter enter a hotel.]\
\
Happy: (pointing at a door) This is you.\
\
Peter: Oh, we\'92re neighbors?\
\
Happy: We\'92re not roommates. Suit up.\
\
[Peter's hotel room. Standing in front of a mirror, we see Peter wearing his homemade Spider-Man suit, consisting of a thin, baggy sweatshirt, goggles with shutters, and web-shooters.]\
\
Peter: Okay, Peter, you got this. You got this.\
\
Happy: What the hell are you wearing?\
\
[Happy is staring at Peter with a horrified look. Peter tilts down the camera to reveal his feet.]\
\
Peter: It\'92s my suit.\
\
Happy: Where\'92s the case?\
\
Peter: What case? That\'92s not my...\
\
[Happy opens a door, showing Peter another area of his suite.]\
\
Peter: What? I thought that was a closet. This is still my room?\
\
Happy: Go. Please.\
\
Peter: My room is way bigger than...\
\
Happy: There.\
\
[A case is sitting on a coffee table.]\
\
Peter: I found the case. I found the case. I found the case.\
\
[He plucks up a card that says \'93A minor upgrade -TS\'94 from the case.]\
\
Peter: \'93A minor upgrade\'94?\
\
[When Peter unbuckles a lock the case unfolds itself, revealing a high tech Spider-Man suit complete with awesome holograms.]\
\
Peter: Whoa. Oh my God.\
\
Happy: Put it on.\
\
Peter: What the...? This is the coolest thing I\'92ve ever seen-\
\
Happy: Let\'92s go.\
\
Peter: But, yeah. Well, I don\'92t understand. Is it for me?\
\
[Camera spins to find Happy leaving the room.]\
\
Peter: Happy, Happy, wait.\
\
[Peter takes off the mask of his homemade Spider-Man suit with a huge, excited grin on his face.]\
\
Peter: This is insane. Insane. Look at this thing. Look. Look at the eyes. This is the greatest day of my life.\
\
Happy: Let\'92s go.\
\
[He has come to drag a hyped-up Peter out of the room.]\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
Happy: Come on.\
\
[Outside Flughafen Leipzig-Halle, We see Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Black Widow, and Black Panther confronting each other.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) Okay, there\'92s Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow. Whoa. Who\'92s that new guy?\
\
Tony: Underoos!\
\
[We see Peter, now dressed in the Spider-Man suit that Tony gave him.]\
\
Peter: Oh, that\'92s me. I gotta go. I gotta go.\
\
[Peter puts down the phone and proceeds to snatch Captain America\'92s shield with his web.]\
\
[Later.]\
\
Peter: Hey, everyone.\
\
[He is holding his camera and flying through the air to find a safe spot. We see and hear explosions everywhere.]\
\
Peter: Okay, so the craziest thing just happened, right? I just had a fight with Captain America and I stole his shield and I threw it at him-\
\
[We hear a metallic noise. Ant-Man grows into a giant in the background and grabs War Machine by his ankle. Peter turns to see this.]\
\
Peter: What the hell? He\'92s big now. I gotta go. Hang on.\
\
[The phone is put down and for a moment, all we see are the sky and the clouds. Then we hear the battle commencing and see Peter being flung through the air.]\
\
Peter: Whoa!\
\
[Back in Peter's hotel room. Peter is facing the camera, now dressed in a grey NASA T-shirt. It is obvious that he is still high on adrenaline.]\
\
Peter: It was the most amazing thing that\'92s ever happened! So Mr. Stark was like, \'93Hey, Underoos!\'94 and I just sort of flipped in and I stole Cap\'92s shield. I was like, \'93Hey, what\'92s up, everybody?\'94 And then...\
\
[There\'92s a knock on his door.]\
\
Peter: Hey, just a second! Coming!\
\
[He backflips to the door, but before he can open it, Happy enters in a bathrobe.]\
\
Peter: Hey.\
\
Happy: We have thin walls here.\
\
[Camera starts rolling. We are now inside Tony's car. A hand reaches for it and we tilt up to find Tony Stark in a suit and sunglasses ensemble.]\
\
Tony: What are you doing, a little video diary?\
\
Peter: (embarrassed) Yeah.\
\
Tony: It\'92s all right. I\'92d probably do the same.\
\
Happy: (from the driver\'92s seat) I told him not to do it. He was filming everything.\
\
Tony: It\'92s okay.\
\
Happy: I\'92m gonna wipe the chip.\
\
Tony: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You know what? We should actually... We should make an alibi video for your aunt anyway. You ready?\
\
[Tony takes off his sunglasses, revealing a badly bruised face.]\
\
Peter: Yeah, hold on.\
\
Tony: We rolling?\
\
Peter: An alibi? Sure.\
\
Tony: Get in the frame.\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
Tony: Hey, May. How you doing? What are you wearing? Something skimpy, I hope.\
\
[Peter turns to Tony with a frown on his face. Tony chuckles and pats Peter\'92s shoulder, whose face now wears an uncomfortable smile.]\
\
Tony: Peter, that\'92s inappropriate. All right, let\'92s start over. You can edit it.\
\
Peter: Mm-hmm.\
\
[Looking at Tony, Peter chuckles.]\
\
Tony: Three, two, one. Hey, May. My gosh, uh, I wanted to tell you what an incredible job your nephew did this weekend at the Stark internship retreat. Everyone was impressed.\
\
[Tony is putting on a solemn face. Peter offers the camera a wide-eyed, tight-lipped smile, trying to look innocent. Suddenly, we hear a loud honk.]\
\
Happy: Come on! It\'92s a freaking merge. (to Tony) I\'92m sorry.\
\
Tony: This is because you\'92re not on Queens Boulevard. (to the camera) See, Happy is... is hoping to get bumped up to asset management. He was forehead of security, and before that, he was just a driver.\
\
[Still driving, Happy gives Tony a sidelong glance.]\
\
Happy: That was a private conversation. I don\'92t like joking about this. It was hard for me to talk to you about that.\
\
Tony: No, seriously, was he snoring a bunch?\
\
[Happy slams on the brakes, making the car screech to a stop.]\
\
Happy: All right. Here we are. End of the line. Whoops.\
\
[Tony laughs and films Peter, who looks a bit pale.]\
\
Tony: Happy, can you give us a moment?\
\
Happy: You want me to leave the car?\
\
Tony: Why don\'92t you grab Peter\'92s case out of the trunk.\
\
[Peter\'92s film finally stops rolling. He slowly lowers his phone, shocked.]\
\
Peter: I can keep the suit?\
\
Tony: Yes, we were just talking about it.\
\
[Tony puts his sunglasses back on and clears his throat. Through the rear window, we see Happy struggling with Peter\'92s case.]\
\
Tony: Do me a favor, though. Happy\'92s kind of your point guy on this. Don\'92t stress him out. Don\'92t do anything stupid. I\'92ve seen his cardiogram. All right?\
\
Peter: (enthusiastically) Yes.\
\
Tony: Don\'92t do anything I would do, and definitely don\'92t do anything I wouldn\'92t do. There\'92s a... There\'92s a little grey area in there, and that\'92s where you operate.\
\
Peter: Wait, does that mean that I\'92m an Avenger?\
\
Tony: No.\
\
[Happy knocks on the window and holds the case up.]\
\
Happy: This it?\
\
Tony: Seventh floor.\
\
Peter: I can take that. You don\'92t have to take it.\
\
Happy: You\'92re gonna take it?\
\
Peter: Yeah, I can take that.\
\
Happy: Thank you.\
\
[Happy drops the case by the car.]\
\
Peter: So when\'92s, when\'92s our next... When\'92s our next \'93retreat,\'94 you know? Like...\
\
Tony: What, next mission?\
\
Peter: Yeah, the mission. The missions.\
\
Tony: We\'92ll call you.\
\
Peter: Do you have my numbers?\
\
Tony: No, I mean, we\'92ll call you. Like, someone will call you.\
\
Peter: Oh.\
\
Tony: All right?\
\
Peter: From your team.\
\
Tony: Okay.\
\
[Tony reaches for the door. Peter mistakes the gesture as a hug and brings his arms around Tony.]\
\
Tony: It\'92s not a hug. I\'92m just grabbing the door for you. We\'92re not there yet.\
\
[Peter awkwardly climbs out of the car. Almost as an afterthought, Tony calls out:]\
\
Tony: Bye.\
\
[Tony and Happy drive off. Holding his bag and the Spider-Man suit case, Peter grins.]\
\
Peter: They\'92re gonna call me.\
\
[He heads to the apartment entrance. There is a definite spring in his step.]\
\
TWO MONTHS LATER\
\
[Peter is standing in a packed subway train. He takes out his phone and types out a text.]\
\
Hey Happy just checking in. I'm out of school at 2:45 PM\
\
Ready for my next mission!\
\
It's Peter BTW.\
\
Parker\
\
[He scrolls through numerous unanswered messages to Happy.]\
\
[The train drops Peter off at 36th Avenue Station, which is right next to Midtown High. He walks downstairs to street level where football fields stand surrounded by fences. Peter strolls down the sidelines and approaches the main building. We see students playing all kinds of sports on the field. He climbs a flight of stairs, then quickly avoids being hit by a convertible driven by Flash Thompson, a slick-haired teenager.]\
\
Flash: What\'92s up, Penis Parker?\
\
[Students chuckle at that. Peter suppresses a sigh and moves on.]\
\
[A school news report is playing in the hallway, Betty Brant and Jason Ionello as the news anchors.]\
\
Betty: Rise and shine, Midtown Science and Technology.\
\
Jason: Students, don\'92t forget about your homecoming tickets. Do you have a date for homecoming?\
\
Betty: Thanks, Jason, but I already have a date.\
\
Jason: Okay.\
\
Betty: Yeah.\
\
[On TV, we see Jason rolling his eyes awkwardly.]\
\
Principal Morita: Good morning.\
\
[A teenage boy flies a drone around the crowded hallway. Peter walks by. Principal Morita grabs the drone out of the air.]\
\
Principal Morita: Damn it. You, in my office right now.\
\
[The drone pilot follows the principal. Other students carry elaborate science projects. Peter stops at his locker and takes off his jacket. He enters the combination and opens the locker. We see Peter from inside the locker. Suddenly, a hand pops up behind him. It\'92s Ned Leeds holding a Palpatine Lego figure over Peter\'92s shoulder.]\
\
Ned: (imitating Emperor Palpatine) Join me, and together... we\'92ll build my new Lego Death Star.\
\
Peter: What?\
\
[Peter glances around and hears a cheerleader say:]\
\
Cheerleader: So lame.\
\
Peter: No way! That\'92s awesome. How many pieces?\
\
Ned: Three thousand eight hundred and three.\
\
Peter: That\'92s insane.\
\
Ned: I know. You want to build it tonight?\
\
Peter: No, I can\'92t tonight. I\'92ve got the Stark-\
\
Ned: Mm-hmm. Stark internship.\
\
Peter: Yeah, exactly.\
\
[Having picked up his textbooks, Peter starts to walk down the hallway with his best friend.]\
\
Ned: Always got that internship.\
\
Peter: Yeah, well, hopefully, soon it\'92ll lead to a real job with them.\
\
Ned: That would be so sweet.\
\
Peter: Right?\
\
Ned: He\'92d be all, \'93Good job on those spreadsheets, Peter. Here\'92s a gold coin.\'94\
\
[Peter gives him a look.]\
\
Ned: I don\'92t know how jobs work.\
\
Peter: That\'92s exactly how they work.\
\
Ned: Oh. (chuckles) I\'92ll knock out the basic bones of the Death Star at my place. And, and then I\'92ll come by afterwards...\
\
[His voice fades out as Peter slows to a stop. In slow motion, we see who caught his eye- a pretty dark-haired girl talking with her friends down the hall. Her name is Liz. She brushes her hair back and their eyes meet for a fleeting moment. Peter is mesmerized. He can barely keep up with his conversation with Ned.]\
\
Ned: ...because for the most part, the difficult thing is the base of it. The top half we can knock out in two hours, tops.\
\
Peter: That\'92d be great.\
\
[The school bell rings.]\
\
Girl: I\'92m gonna be late!\
\
[We are now in physics class.]\
\
Ms. Warren: Okay, so how do we calculate linear acceleration between points A and B?\
\
[She points at Flash, who is confidently holding up his hand.]\
\
Ms. Warren: Flash.\
\
Flash: It\'92s the product of sine of the angle and gravity divided by the mass.\
\
Ms. Warren: Nope.\
\
[Another hand goes up, but Ms. Warren calls out a student who clearly is having difficulty focusing on the lecture.]\
\
Ms. Warren: Peter. You still with us?\
\
[Peter has been watching a video of Spider-Man on YouTube.]\
\
Peter: Uh... Uh... Yeah, yeah.\
\
[He closes the laptop, revealing a diagram of a simple gravity pendulum.]\
\
Peter: Uh... Mass cancels out, so it\'92s just gravity times sine.\
\
Ms. Warren: Right. See, Flash, being the fastest isn\'92t always the best if you are wrong.\
\
[The class bursts out in laughter. Flash has turned in his seat and is glaring at Peter.]\
\
Flash: (whispers) You\'92re dead.\
\
[Peter turns to glance at a clock. 11:38 a.m.]\
\
[When Peter faces the front, we see that he is now wearing safety goggles.]\
\
Mr. Cobbwell: Today we\'92ll be talking about Danish physicist Niels Bohr, but trust me, there is nothing Bohr-ing about his discoveries regarding quantum theory.\
\
[As Mr. Cobbwell continues on his introduction on Bohr, Peter opens his notes to a page titled \'93Web Fluid Version 3.01.\'94 We see molecule diagrams and a list of liquids such as salicylic acid, toluene, and methanol.]\
\
[Inside an open drawer is a beaker. Peter quickly and surreptitiously pours some orange liquid in it and stirs the concoction. It starts to increase in volume, running over the beaker walls. When Peter lifts the glass stirring rod, the compound sticks to it like spiderweb. Flustered, Peter quickly shuts the drawer and looks at the clock. It\'92s 12:35 p.m.]\
\
[A homecoming banner is hung over the clock on the cafeteria wall by Liz, who is standing on a ladder. Peter and Ned are sitting next to each other and watching her.]\
\
Peter: Did Liz get a new top?\
\
Ned: No. We\'92ve seen that before, but never with that skirt.\
\
[A girl passes by and says hello to Liz.]\
\
Girl: Liz, hey.\
\
Liz: Hi!\
\
Girl: That looks so good!\
\
Peter: We should probably stop staring before it gets creepy, though.\
\
Michelle: Too late.\
\
[Peter and Ned turn to see Michelle sitting at the other end of their table.]\
\
Michelle: You guys are losers.\
\
Ned: But then why do you sit with us?\
\
Michelle: Because I don\'92t have any friends.\
\
[A poster hangs on the auditorium wall. It is for the Academic Decathlon nationals taking place in Washington D.C. on October 13-15. The Decathlon practice is commencing. Liz is standing at a podium, reading the quiz cards. Ned, Charles, Abe, and Cindy are seated on the stage. Bells are placed in front of them.]\
\
Liz: Let\'92s move to the next question. What is the heaviest naturally-occurring element?\
\
Charles: Hydrogen\'92s the lightest. That\'92s not the question. Okay. Yeah.\
\
Abe: Uranium.\
\
[Cindy Moon, who was frantically searching the books, glares at Abe.]\
\
Liz: That is correct. Thank you, Abraham.\
\
Abe: (quietly pumping his fist in the air) Yes.\
\
Liz: Please open your books to page ten.\
\
[A few feet away, Peter is conversing with Mr. Harrington, the teacher who is in charge of the Decathlon team.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Peter, it\'92s nationals. Is there no way you could take one weekend off?\
\
Peter: I can\'92t go to Washington because if Mr. Stark needs me, then I have to make sure that I\'92m here.\
\
Flash: You\'92ve never even been in the same room as Tony Stark.\
\
[Flash speaks up from behind them, reading a book with his feet propped up in a chair.]\
\
Cindy: Wait, what\'92s happening?\
\
[Sally Avril, who is lying on her stomach and studying her notes, answers her.]\
\
Sally: Peter\'92s not going to Washington.\
\
Cindy: No. No, no, no, no, no. No. No.\
\
[Abe rings the bell beside her.]\
\
Abe: Why not?\
\
Liz: Really? Right before nationals?\
\
Michelle: He already quit marching band and robotics lab.\
\
[Everyone looks at Michelle, who is leaning on the wall with a book, with a suspicious look on their faces. Michelle quickly adds:]\
\
Michelle: I\'92m not obsessed with him. Just very observant.\
\
Liz: Flash, you\'92re in for Peter.\
\
Flash: Ooh, I don\'92t know. I gotta check my calendar first. I got a hot date with Black Widow coming up.\
\
[Abe rings the bell.]\
\
Abe: That is false.\
\
Mr. Harrington: What did I tell you about using the bell for comedic purposes?\
\
[Peter turns to see the clock: it\'92s still 1:18 p.m.]\
\
[We see quick glimpses of Peter fidgeting as he looks at the clock. Fingers drumming the desk, foot tapping on the floor until finally, the clock hits 2:45 p.m. and the school bell rings.]\
\
[The bell barely stops ringing before Peter reaches the front steps of the building. Looking around to check if anyone\'92s watching him, he leaps over a fence taller than himself without touching it.]\
\
[Peter runs toward a deli and nods at a man sitting at the corner.]\
\
Peter: Hey, what\'92s up?\
\
Man: Hey, man.\
\
[Peter enters Delmar's Deli-Grocery and heads to the counter. He seems like he\'92s quite a regular at the store.]\
\
Peter: What\'92s up, Mr. Delmar?\
\
Mr. Delmar: Hey, Mr. Parker. Number five, right?\
\
[Peter picks up jelly in a plastic bag and puts it on the counter. It says "Best By 03.16.18."]\
\
Peter: Yeah, um, and, uh, with pickles, and can you smush it down real flat? Thanks.\
\
Deli Clerk: You got it, boss.\
\
Mr. Delmar: How\'92s your aunt?\
\
Peter: Yeah, she\'92s alright.\
\
[Mr. Delmar turns to speak to his staff in Spanish.]\
\
Mr. Delmar: La t\'eda de \'e9 les una italiana muy bellissima. (His aunt is a very hot Italian woman.)\
\
Deli Clerk: \'bfAh, s\'ed? (Oh, yeah?)\
\
Peter: \'bfC\'f3mo est\'e1 tu hija, eh? (How is your daughter, huh?)\
\
[The deli staff hoots behind the counter. Delmar\'92s grin fades.]\
\
Mr. Delmar: Ten dollars.\
\
Peter: It\'92s five dollars.\
\
Mr. Delmar: For that comment, ten dollars.\
\
Peter: Hey, come on, I\'92m joking. I\'92m joking.\
\
[Peter pulls out some cash from his wallet and hands it over to Delmar. Delmar takes the money with a grumpy look on his face.]\
\
Peter: Here\'92s five dollars.\
\
[Peter moves toward a fat cat lying on the counter and pets him.]\
\
Peter: What\'92s up, Murph? How you doing, buddy?\
\
[When he returns to collect his food, Mr. Delmar strikes up a conversation.]\
\
Mr. Delmar: So, how\'92s school?\
\
Peter: Ah, you know, it\'92s boring. Got better things to do.\
\
Mr. Delmar: Stay in school, kid. Stay in school. Otherwise, you\'92re gonna end up like me.\
\
Peter: This is great.\
\
Mr. Delmar: Best sandwiches in Queens.\
\
[He hands Peter his sandwich.]\
\
[Peter leaves the store and runs across the street with a bag of sandwich in his hand. He passes under an elevated train track, holding up his palm at a cab that honks at him, and runs into an alley. He takes off his shoes and throws them aside. He seems to be in a hurry.]\
\
[From his backpack, Peter pulls out a blue and red Spider-Man suit. He knocks over a garbage can as he awkwardly takes off his pants. Peter yanks off his shirt and sweater, then steps into his suit, wearing only his boxers. Jumping, he pulls the full-body suit up over his legs. Peter fits his arms in the sleeves, then puts on the mask, which covers his entire head. The baggy suit hangs loosely over his slender frame.]\
\
[Peter webs his backpack against a dumpster, then hits the spider emblem on his chest. The material shrinks, fitting him snugly.]\
\
[Peter presses a button on his web-shooter, activating hologram displays, adjusts the lenses on his high tech mask, and jumps onto the roof of a building. \'93Blizkrieg Bop\'94 by Ramones starts to play as he leaps across roofs with his sandwich bag in hand. Crouching down on a ledge, he looks down at the streets and sighs.]\
\
Peter: Ah, finally.\
\
[A bicycle chain is broken. The thief rides the stolen bike down a sidewalk, pushing passersby off the street. Peter swings after him, lands in front of him, and holds out one end of a strand of web.]\
\
Peter: Hey, could you hold this for a second? Thanks.\
\
[When the thief looks down at his hand, Peter uses his momentary distraction to glue him to the web. Peter lets go and the thief is pulled into the air. The thief still dangling above him, Peter holds up the bike and searches for its owner.]\
\
Peter: Hey, is this anybody\'92s bike? No?\
\
[A man comes out of a store.]\
\
Peter: Hey, buddy, is this your bike?\
\
Man: I have no change.\
\
Peter: Does anyone have a pen? Do you have a pen?\
\
[On the handle of the bike, Peter has left a note saying: \'93IS THIS YOUR BIKE? IF NOT, DON\'92T STEAL IT! SPIDER-MAN.\'94]\
\
[Peter swings by a train station high above ground level and strikes a pose.]\
\
Peter: Whoo! Everybody good?\
\
[He then rides on top of a subway car, reading something on his phone.]\
\
[Peter is slowly standing up on the edge of a building, the flag of the United States billowing in the wind behind him, when a man calls out:]\
\
Street Vendor: Hey! You\'92re that spider guy on YouTube, right?\
\
Peter: Call me Spider-Man!\
\
Street Vendor: Okay, Spider-Man. Do a flip.\
\
[Peter does a backflip on the roof.]\
\
Street Vendor: Yeah!\
\
Man: Not bad.\
\
[One moment, Peter is swinging down from rooftops and yelling, and another moment, he is patiently giving directions to an old woman. A thin strand of web suspended between a building and an old, rusty water tank, he practices his tightrope skills, too.]\
\
[A man tries to open a car door with a thin slab of metal. Peter sees this, jumps onto the roof of the car, then uses his web to bang the man\'92s head on the car. The car starts to make loud beeping noises.]\
\
Peter: Hey, buddy. Shouldn\'92t steal cars. It\'92s bad.\
\
[Peter glues the man\'92s hand to the car and jumps off.]\
\
Car Jacker: It\'92s my car, dumbass!\
\
[An old woman, Marjorie, looks out from her window and starts to shout at Peter. All hell breaks loose.]\
\
Marjorie: Hey! Shut that off!\
\
Peter: I was just tryin\'92 to-\
\
Car Jacker: Can you tell him it\'92s my car?\
\
Day Sleeper: I work at nights! Come on, dude!\
\
Old Man: That\'92s not your car! That\'92s his car.\
\
Peter: How was I supposed to know? He was putting that thing in the window!\
\
Resident 1: Every day with these damn alarms!\
\
Resident 2: Shut it off!\
\
[The neighbors continue to shout at Peter. An old, white-haired man wearing sunglasses (Stan Lee cameo) shouts at Peter, but then Marjorie notices him from the building across the street.]\
\
Gary: Don\'92t make me come down there, you punk!\
\
Marjorie: Hey, Gary. How you doing?\
\
Gary: Marjorie, how are you? How\'92s your mother?\
\
[Later. Peter swings through an alley. His grip on his web slips, causing him to fall on his face.]\
\
Peter: Ugh! I\'92m good, I\'92m good.\
\
[Later. The sun is setting]\
\
Voicemail: You have reached the voicemail box of...\
\
Happy: Happy Hogan.\
\
[We find Peter perching on a fire exit high above the ground and munching on his sandwich.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Happy! Um, here\'92s my report for tonight. I stopped a grand theft bicycle. Couldn\'92t find the owner, so I just left a note. Um... I helped this lost, old Dominican lady. She was really nice and bought me a churro. So I just, um, feel like I could be doing more. You know? Just curious when the next real mission is gonna be. So, yeah, just call me back. It\'92s Peter. Parker.\
\
[Peter hangs up his phone and sighs.]\
\
Peter: Why would I tell him about the churro?\
\
[A warning signal blinks on his web-shooter. Web fluid low. Peter ejects the cartridge, then scrambles to catch it, standing sideways off the fire escape. He places the cartridge on his belt. And spots four men entering a closed bank.]\
\
Robber 1: Can\'92t wait to see this thing, guys.\
\
Peter: Finally, something good.\
\
[Inside Queens Community Bank, a robber wearing a Hulk mask is cutting the ATM with a high tech tool that has a glowing Chitauri energy core inside.]\
\
Robber 1: Yo, this high tech stuff makes it too easy.\
\
Robber 2: Told you it was worth it.\
\
Robber 1: Okay, go, go, go.\
\
[Another robber uses a high tech device to grab and pull off the front of the ATM. The huge chunk of metal is suspended in air. Other robbers start to bag the cash.]\
\
Robber 3: Oh, nice.\
\
Robber 4: We can hit, like, five more places tonight.\
\
[Behind them, Peter silently comes through the door and awkwardly tries to strike a casual but cool-looking pose.]\
\
Peter: (clears his throat) What\'92s up, guys? You forgot your PIN number?\
\
[The robbers turn to him. Reveal that they are wearing cheap plastic masks of the Avengers. The Hulk, Captain America, Thor, and Iron man.]\
\
Peter: Whoa! You\'92re the Avengers. What are you guys doing here?\
\
[One of the robbers loads his gun but Peter uses his web to grab it and hit \'93Iron Man\'94 and \'93Thor\'94 with it. He then proceeds to push \'93Hulk\'94 away. His sticky feet hold \'93Thor\'94 and throw him into a wall.]\
\
Peter: Thor. Hulk. Good to finally meet you guys. I thought you\'92d be more handsome in person.\
\
[Peter is hanging upside down from the ceiling when \'93Iron Man\'94 starts to throw aimless punches at him.]\
\
Peter: Iron Man. Hey, what are you doing robbing a bank? You\'92re a billionaire.\
\
[\'93Hulk\'94 comes up with a high tech weapon. Peter quickly dodges a punch from \'93Iron Man,\'94 who loses balance and ends up punching \'93Hulk\'94 instead. They both fall to the ground. Meanwhile, \'93Captain America\'94 succeeds in picking up the high tech device that had been used to pull the metal chunk off the ATM and aims it at Peter. Peter jumps at him but is suspended in air for a short time. His voice is all distorted when he says:]\
\
Peter: Hey! Oh, this feels so weird.\
\
[He is thrown against the wall.]\
\
Peter: Whoa, what is that thing?\
\
[He is once more caught in the force field of the device and is thrown back and forth between the ceiling and the floor.]\
\
Peter: I\'92m starting... to think... you\'92re not... the Avengers!\
\
[With his sticky fingers, he holds onto the ground and shoots his web at a desk in the corner. He pulls on it and hits \'93Captain America\'94 with his force field device.]\
\
[Mr. Delmar is watching the attempted bank robbery from his deli across the street; money flying everywhere, Spider-Man jumping off walls, the \'93Avengers\'94 trying to fight him.]\
\
911 Operator: 911. What\'92s your emergency?\
\
Mr. Delmar: Uh... Spider-Man is fighting the Avengers in a bank on 21st street.\
\
Peter: Alright guys, let\'92s wrap this up. It\'92s a school night.\
\
[Peter kicks \'93Thor\'94 into a glass wall, making it crack. \'93Iron Man\'94 holds up the force field device, but before he can do anything, Peter webs the device against the glass, jumps onto \'93Iron Man,\'94 and checks his face underneath the mask.]\
\
Peter: So, how do jerks like you get tech like this?\
\
[\'93Hulk\'94 fires up the device that cuts through metal.]\
\
Peter: No. Wait, wait, wait!\
\
[Peter quickly pulls \'93Iron Man\'94 and himself out of the way. The plasma blast cuts through walls and hits Mr. Delmar\'92s store across the street. The deli-grocery bursts into flames.]\
\
Peter: Mr. Delmar.\
\
[Peter quickly runs into the decimated store.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Mr. Delmar, you in there? Is anybody in here? Hello?\
\
[He helps Mr. Delmar, who is wheezing and coughing but alive, out of the burning building. Murph the cat is safe in Peter\'92s arms, too. But when he turns to the bank, he finds that it is empty. The robbers have escaped.]\
\
Peter: Oh, come on. You\'92ve got to be-\
\
[The cat starts to meow. Peter hands Murph to Mr. Delmar.]\
\
Peter: Here, here.\
\
Mr. Delmar: Good, yeah.\
\
[Inside the Avengers Tower, Tony\'92s belongings are being packed up. Dum-E picks up an expensive-looking china vase.]\
\
Happy: (to Dum-E) Okay. Good. Yes. Yes- No. No, put that down. That\'92s worth more than you or me. (takes a call) Yeah?\
\
[Peter is running down a rooftop.]\
\
Peter: Happy, the craziest thing just happened to me. These guys were robbing an ATM with these high tech weapons-\
\
Happy: Hey, take a breath, okay? I don\'92t have time for ATM robberies...\
\
Peter: Yeah, but-\
\
Happy: ...or the thoughtful notes you leave behind. I have moving day to worry about. Everything\'92s gotta be out of here by next week.\
\
[Peter jumps onto another rooftop, then stops in his tracks.]\
\
Peter: Wait. Wait! You\'92re moving? Who\'92s moving?\
\
Happy: Yeah, don\'92t you watch the news? Tony sold Avengers Tower. We\'92re relocating to a new facility upstate where, hopefully, the cell service is much worse.\
\
Peter: But what about me?\
\
[It is Happy\'92s turn to be confused.]\
\
Happy: What about you?\
\
[Peter sits down on a streetlamp.]\
\
Peter: Well, what if Mr. Stark needs me or something, I don\'92t know, something big goes down? Can I please just talk to Mr. Stark?\
\
Happy: Look, just stay away from anything too dangerous. I\'92m responsible for making sure you\'92re responsible, okay?\
\
[Peter leaps down into the alley he stashed his backpack in.]\
\
Peter: I am responsible. I- Oh, crap. My backpack\'92s gone.\
\
[Happy is now standing inside an elevator.]\
\
Happy: That doesn\'92t sound responsible.\
\
Peter: I\'92ll call you back.\
\
Happy: Feel free not to.\
\
[The elevator doors slide close as Happy cuts the call.]\
\
[Peter puts his mask back on and runs out of the alley.]\
\
[Peter climbs up his apartment building, still clad in his Spider-Man suit and dodging windows. He slides the top of his bedroom window open and looks inside. Aunt May passes in front of his open door.]\
\
[Peter climbs into the bedroom via his ceiling and closes the window with his foot. He pulls off his mask, throws it away, and crawls across the ceiling. Trying to make no sound, he pushes the door close and hops down to the floor. We hear a quiet click as the door latch slides into place.]\
\
[Peter makes a turn to find Ned sitting on his bed. Shocked, mouth agape. The Lego Death Star crashes to the ground and breaks down into pieces.]\
\
May: What was that?\
\
Peter: Uh, it\'92s nothing. It\'92s nothing!\
\
Ned: You\'92re the Spider-Man. From YouTube.\
\
Peter: I\'92m not. I\'92m not.\
\
[Peter presses the spider emblem on his chest. The suit becomes baggy again and falls down from his body.]\
\
Ned: You were on the ceiling.\
\
Peter: No, I wasn\'92t. Ned, what are you doing in my room?\
\
Ned: May let me in. You said we were gonna finish the Death Star.\
\
Peter: You can\'92t just bust into my room!\
\
[May opens the door, setting her hair free from a low bun. She waves a rag in front of her face to dissipate the smoke coming from the kitchen.]\
\
May: The turkey meatloaf recipe is a disaster. Let\'92s go to dinner. Thai? Ned, you want Thai?\
\
Ned: Yes.\
\
Peter: No. He\'92s got a thing.\
\
Ned: A thing to do after.\
\
May: Okay.\
\
[She waves a finger at Peter, who is clad only in his boxers.]\
\
May: Maybe put on some clothes.\
\
[May leaves and closes the door behind her.]\
\
Ned: Oh, she doesn\'92t know?\
\
Peter: Nobody knows. I mean, Mr. Stark knows because he made my suit, but that\'92s it.\
\
Ned: (whispers) Tony Stark made you that? Are you an Avenger?\
\
Peter: (hesitates) Yeah, basically.\
\
Ned: Whoa...\
\
Peter: You can\'92t tell anybody about this. You gotta keep it a secret.\
\
Ned: A secret? Why?\
\
Peter: You know what she\'92s like. If she finds out people try and kill me every single night, she\'92s not going to let me do this anymore. Come on, Ned, please.\
\
Ned: Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I\'92ll level with you. I don\'92t think I can keep this a secret. This is the greatest thing that\'92s ever happened to me, Peter!\
\
Peter: Ned, May cannot know. I cannot do that to her right now, you know? I mean, everything that\'92s happened with her, I... Please.\
\
Ned: Okay.\
\
Peter: Just swear it, okay?\
\
Ned: I swear.\
\
Peter: Thank you.\
\
Ned: Yeah.\
\
[Peter walks away, running his hands through his hair.]\
\
Peter: I can\'92t believe this is happening right now.\
\
Ned: Can I try the suit on?\
\
Peter: No.\
\
Ned: How does it work? Is it magnets? How do you shoot the strings?\
\
Peter: I\'92m gonna tell you about this at school tomorrow, okay?\
\
Ned: Great. Okay, well, wait, then. How do you do this and the Stark internship?\
\
Peter: This is the Stark internship.\
\
Ned: Oh.\
\
Peter: Just get out of here.\
\
[Peter ushers Ned out, leans on the door, and facepalms.]\
\
[Peter and may are sitting at a small table at Prachya Thai and eating dinner. May tries to make Peter talk, but he looks distracted.]\
\
May: What\'92s the matter? Thought you loved larb. It\'92s too larby? Not larby enough. How many times do I have to say \'93larb\'94 before you talk to me? You know I larb you.\
\
Peter: I\'92m just stressed. The internship, and I\'92m tired. A lot of work.\
\
May: The Stark internship. I have to tell you, not a fan of that Tony Stark. Distracted all the time... he\'92s got you in your head.\
\
[A news report on the television behind May catches Peter\'92s attention.]\
\
News Anchor: The beloved Queens\'92 institution, Delmar\'92s Sandwiches, was destroyed...\
\
May: What does he have you doing?\
\
News Anchor: ...in an explosion...\
\
May: You need to use your instincts.\
\
[She becomes quiet as she turns to listen to the news reporter.]\
\
News Anchor: ...earlier tonight after an ATM robbery was thwarted by Queens\'92 own colorful local crime-stopper, the Spider-Man. As the Spider-Man attempted to foil their heist, a powerful blast was set off, slicing through the bodega across the street. Miraculously, no one was harmed.\
\
[Aunt May turns back to Peter with a serious expression.]\
\
May: If you spot something like that happening, you turn and you run the other way.\
\
Peter: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.\
\
May: Six blocks away from us.\
\
Peter: I... uh... I need a new backpack.\
\
[May puts a finger to her ear, disbelief clear on her face.]\
\
May: What?\
\
Peter: I need a new backpack.\
\
May: That\'92s five.\
\
[A waiter brings a new dish to their table, his eyes glued on May.]\
\
Thai Waiter: Sticky rice pudding.\
\
May: Oh, we didn\'92t order that.\
\
Thai Waiter: It\'92s on the house.\
\
[The waiter winks, then leaves.]\
\
May: Oh! Thanks. (to Peter) That\'92s nice of him.\
\
Peter: I think he larbs you.\
\
[At Peter\'92s joke, May points at herself with a exaggerated look of surprise.]\
\
[The next morning, Peter is walking down the street with Ned, carrying a huge stack of thick books in his arms due to the loss of his backpack.]\
\
Ned: You got bit by a spider? Can it bite me? Well, it probably would\'92ve hurt, right? You know what? Whatever. Even if it did hurt, I\'92d let it bite me. Maybe. How much did it hurt?\
\
Peter: The spider\'92s dead, Ned.\
\
[Peter cuts the conversation short, allowing no room for further discussion on the subject. Ned shrugs and looks ahead. His eyes go wide.]\
\
Ned: Whoa.\
\
[Ned and Peter stop short, examining Delmar\'92s Sandwiches. It is almost burnt down, the store name almost illegible. Police tape and barricades surround the shop. Various police officers and crime scene investigators are working around it.]\
\
Ned: You were here?\
\
[Peter warily eyes the agents standing near the scene.]\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Ned: You could\'92ve died.\
\
[The teens stare at the badly damaged building. Expressions completely serious.]\
\
Ned: Do you lay eggs?\
\
Peter: What? No.\
\
[Peter laughs at the absurd and anticlimactic suggestion.]\
\
[In the middle of a chemistry lecture. A torch is boiling a dark-colored liquid on the desk. Peter and Ned are wearing safety glasses. Ned rolls over in his chair toward Peter, who is scribbling in his notebook.]\
\
Ned: (in a low voice) Can you spit venom?\
\
Peter: No.\
\
Ned: Can you summon an army of spiders?\
\
[Suppressing a sigh, Peter looks up in the guise of concentrating on the lecture and bends down again to take some notes.]\
\
Peter: No, Ned.\
\
History Teacher: The Sokovia Accords were put into place...\
\
[Over Peter\'92s shoulder, we see a teacher droning on. Ned leans into frame and engages in a whispered conversation with Peter.]\
\
Ned: How far can you shoot your webs?\
\
Peter: It\'92s unknown. Shut up.\
\
History Teacher: ...to begin regulating...\
\
Ned: If I was you, I would stand on the edge of a building and just shoot it as far as I could-\
\
Peter: Shut up, Ned.\
\
[Peter\'92s voice rises a little in volume. The girl sitting in front of Peter and Ned turns around and shoots them an irritated glare.]\
\
[A small, old television is set up beside Coach Wilson, the PE teacher, who is standing with a bored expression. Captain America\'92s Fitness Challenge is playing on the screen. Captain America, in his full uniform, smiles pleasantly, standing in a locker room.]\
\
Steve: Hi. I\'92m Captain America. Whether you\'92re in the classroom or on the battlefield...\
\
[Midtown High students are sitting in neat rows on the bleachers, watching Captain America give a speech on screen. We close up on Peter and Ned. Behind them, Michelle is completely engrossed in a book called \'91Of Human Bondage\'92.]\
\
Ned: Do you know him too?\
\
Peter: Yeah, we met.\
\
[Ned\'92s eyes widen in awe and his jaw goes slack.]\
\
Steve: ...fitness can be the difference between success or failure.\
\
Peter: I stole his shield.\
\
[Peter boasts, feigning nonchalance. Ned\'92s jaw drops even more.]\
\
Ned: What?\
\
[Peter and Ned continue to watch the television with their classmates. We can see Captain over their shoulders.]\
\
Steve: Today, my good friend, your gym teacher...\
\
[Captain points to his right. Coach Wilson, who is apparently standing on the wrong side, waves his hand to the students.]\
\
Steve: ...will be conducting the Captain America Fitness Challenge.\
\
[He raises his hand in a salute. The screen transitions to \'91Station I: Sit-ups\'92.]\
\
Coach Wilson: Thank you, Captain. I\'92m pretty sure this guy\'92s a war criminal now, but whatever. I have to show these videos. It\'92s required by the state. Let\'92s do it.\
\
[Coach Wilson blows his whistle.]\
\
[Midtown High School students are engaged in various exercises. Climbing ropes, doing chin-ups, push-ups, et cetera. Michelle is lying on a mat by herself and wielding her book like a weight, still immersed in its contents. We travel between students doing sit-ups in pairs.]\
\
Ned: Do Avengers have to pay taxes?\
\
Peter: Shh!\
\
Ned: What does Hulk smell like?\
\
Peter: Shh!\
\
Ned: I bet he smells nice.\
\
Peter: You have to shut up.\
\
Ned: Is Captain America cool, or is he like a mean, old grandpa?\
\
Peter: Ned, just, shh, okay?\
\
[We finally find Peter lying on a mat and doing sit-ups. Ned is holding his legs in place for him.]\
\
Ned: Hey, can I be your guy in the chair?\
\
Peter: What?\
\
Ned: Yeah. You know how there\'92s a guy with a headset telling the other guy where to go?\
\
[Peter\'92s face contorts into a weird expression. He is still doing sit-ups faster than any other student.]\
\
Ned: Like, like if you\'92re stuck in a burning building, I could tell you where to go. Because there\'92d be screens around me, and I could, you know, swivel around, and... \'91Cause I could be your guy in the chair.\
\
Peter: Ned, I don\'92t need a guy in the chair.\
\
Coach Wilson: Looking good, Parker.\
\
[The teacher points at Peter as he passes the mat that Peter and Ned are working out on. Peter glances at him, then frowns and takes a huffing breath, trying to look as if the exercise is really taking a toll on him.]\
\
[On the bleachers, Liz is sitting with a group of friends.]\
\
Betty: Now, see, for me, it would be F Thor, marry Iron Man, and kill Hulk.\
\
Charles: Well, what about the Spider-Man?\
\
Betty: It\'92s just Spider-Man.\
\
[When the word \'93Spider-Man\'94 reaches Peter and Ned\'92s ears, they stop and turn at the same time to see Liz and her friends.]\
\
Liz: Did you guys see the bank security cam on YouTube? He fought off four guys.\
\
[Peter\'92s eyes go wide.]\
\
Betty: Oh my God, she\'92s crushing on Spider-Man.\
\
Charles: No way.\
\
Liz: (shrugs) Kind of?\
\
Betty: Ugh, gross.\
\
[Ned and Peter exchange a look, surprised at the turn of events. Then they look back at Liz and her friends, still listening in on their conversation.]\
\
Betty: He\'92s probably like, thirty.\
\
Charles: You don\'92t even know what he looks like. Like, what if he\'92s, like, seriously burned?\
\
Liz: I wouldn\'92t care. I would still love him for the person he is on the inside.\
\
Ned: (in a loud voice) Peter knows Spider-Man!\
\
[Peter looks at Ned, shocked. Mouth comically agape. Everyone in the gym simultaneously drops their assignments and stares at Peter. Peter hurriedly gets up and walks to the bleachers. Ned scrambles to his feet to follow him.]\
\
Peter: (stuttering) No, I don\'92t. No. I... I mean...\
\
[Flash, who was climbing up a rope, slides down to the ground.]\
\
Ned: They\'92re friends.\
\
Flash: Yeah, like Coach Wilson and Captain America are friends.\
\
Peter: (stuttering) I\'92ve met him. Yeah. A couple times. But it\'92s, um... through the Stark internship. Mm-hmm.\
\
[Peter turns to Ned, teeth set.]\
\
Peter: Yeah, well. I\'92m not really supposed to talk about it.\
\
Flash: Well, that\'92s awesome. Hey, you know what? Maybe you should invite him to Liz\'92s party. Right?\
\
Liz: Yeah, I\'92m having people over tonight. You\'92re more than welcome to come.\
\
Peter: Having a party?\
\
Flash: Yeah, it\'92s gonna be dope. You should totally invite your personal friend Spider-Man.\
\
Peter: Um...\
\
Liz: It\'92s okay. I know Peter\'92s way too busy for parties anyway, so...\
\
[Liz comes to Peter\'92s rescue, saving Peter from embarrassing himself even further. Flash saunters closer and walks by Peter.]\
\
Flash: Come on. He\'92ll be there. Right, Parker?\
\
[The bell buzzes. Tilting her head toward Peter in a tiny nod of farewell, Liz walks off. Peter, frustrated, throws his hands in the air and swivels to glare at Ned. He moves closer.]\
\
Peter: What are you doing?\
\
Ned: (in a hushed voice) Helping you out. Did you not hear her? Liz has a crush on you.\
\
[Peter hesitates, searching for words.]\
\
Ned: Dude, you\'92re an Avenger. If any one of us has a chance with a senior girl, it\'92s you.\
\
[Ned walks away. Peter stands rooted in place, considering the idea.]\
\
[May drives Ned and Peter to Liz\'92s house. Exciting, upbeat music pours out from the house. May slows her car and talks to the boys.]\
\
May: House party in the suburbs. Oh, I remember these. Kind of jealous.\
\
Ned: It\'92ll be a night to remember.\
\
May: (laughs) Ned, some hats wear men. You wear that hat.\
\
Ned: Yeah, it gives me confidence.\
\
May: Hmm.\
\
[Peter is looking out the window, removed from the merry conversation taking place beside him.]\
\
Peter: This is a mistake. (to May) Hey, let\'92s just go home.\
\
May: Oh, Peter. I know. I know it\'92s really hard trying to fit in with all the changes your body\'92s going through. It\'92s flowering now.\
\
[The absurd, out-of-place speech makes Peter chuckle.]\
\
Peter: Uh-huh.\
\
May: (to Ned) He\'92s so stressed out lately.\
\
Ned: What helps with stress is going to a party. We should go to the party.\
\
Peter: Yeah, let\'92s do it. Yeah. I\'92m gonna go. I\'92m gonna go.\
\
[Peter opens the car door and steps out.]\
\
May: Peter.\
\
[When Aunt May calls his name, Peter stops and leans in to listen to his aunt through the window. Ned gets out behind them.]\
\
May: Have fun, okay?\
\
Peter: (nods) I will.\
\
May: (in a soft voice) Okay.\
\
Ned: Bye, May!\
\
[Ned waves with a huge grin on his face. Peter closes the door and catches up to him. They approach the house side by side.]\
\
Ned: Dude, you have the suit, right?\
\
[Peter pulls up his sleeve in order to offer Ned a glimpse of his Spider-Man suit under it.]\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Ned: This is gonna change our lives.\
\
[The front door opens, revealing Peter and Ned. They enter the crowded house party and glance around anxiously. Peter looks especially nervous. Two girls pass by in front of them, not taking any interest in their arrival.]\
\
Girl: Annie, over here!\
\
Annie: Hey.\
\
[Flash is running a DJ station. Ostentatious in headphones and a yellow shirt.]\
\
Male Voice: DJ Flash!\
\
Ned: Okay. We\'92re gonna have Spider-Man swing in, say you guys are tight, and then I get a fist bump or one of those half bro-hugs.\
\
Michelle: Can\'92t believe you guys are at this lame party.\
\
[Michelle carelessly throws her hair back, trying to act cool. She is in the process of spreading jam on a slice of toast.]\
\
Ned: But you\'92re here too.\
\
Michelle: Am I?\
\
[The toast crunches as Michelle takes a bite out of it and walks away.]\
\
Liz: Oh, my gosh.\
\
[When Peter hears Liz\'92s voice, his eyes go wide. He turns his head towards the sound. Liz walks down the hallway to Peter and Ned.]\
\
Liz: Hey, guys. Cool hat, Ned.\
\
Ned: Hi, Liz.\
\
Peter: Hi, Liz.\
\
[Peter\'92s high-pitched and squeaky voice betrays his nervousness.]\
\
Liz: I\'92m so happy you guys came. There\'92s pizza and drinks. Help yourself.\
\
Peter: What a great party.\
\
Liz: Thanks.\
\
[The sound of glass breaking catches their attention.]\
\
Liz: (sheepish) Oh, I... My parents will kill me if anything\'92s broken. I gotta-\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Liz: Have fun.\
\
Ned: Bye.\
\
Liz: Bye.\
\
[Liz walks away.]\
\
Ned: Dude, what are you doing? She\'92s here. Spider it up.\
\
Peter: No, no, no. I can\'92t... I cannot do this. Spider-Man is not a party trick, okay? Look, I\'92m just gonna... be myself.\
\
Ned: (sighs) Peter, no one wants that.\
\
Peter: Dude.\
\
[Peter starts to walk away, a little bit hurt by the remark.]\
\
Flash: (into a microphone) Penis Parker, what\'92s up?\
\
[Flash plays a honking sound on the stereo system.]\
\
Flash: So, where\'92s your pal Spider-Man? Let me guess. In Canada with your imaginary girlfriend?\
\
[Honking noise again. Everyone around them laughs except Peter and Ned.]\
\
Flash: That\'92s not Spider-Man. That\'92s just Ned in a red shirt.\
\
[The crowd boos and chuckles. Peter frowns, determined.]\
\
[A shirt drops to the floor and joins the already discarded pairs of jeans and shoes. Peter is standing on a roof. He steps over his clothes, wearing his Spider-Man suit, pulls off his T-shirt. As he mutters to himself, he tries to find a way to make his voice sound different.]\
\
Peter: Hey, what\'92s up? I\'92m Spider-Man. Just thought I\'92d swing by and say hello to my buddy Peter. Oh, what\'92s up, Ned? Hey, where\'92s Peter, anyways? He must be around...\
\
[Peter sighs, watching the party through glass walls with a discouraged look.]\
\
Peter: God, this is stupid. What am I doing?\
\
[Peter spots Ned looking for him. Then something catches his eyes. A bright blue explosion in the distance. He stands, staring at it with concern.]\
\
Peter: What the hell?\
\
[Peter runs across the roof and puts on his mask. Shooting webs through trees, he swings down the street.]\
\
[He lands on another roof, flips off the house, then shoots a thin line of spiderweb over a vast golf course. It flies off, having nothing to attach itself to. Wide shot on Peter running across the golf course. The sprinklers are activated.]\
\
Peter: (gasping) This sucks!\
\
[Beside a bridge, we see a discarded car, scraps of metal ripped out from it. A blue ray shoots through the air at a great speed towards it. The car blows up in a huge explosion and makes the shooters cringe in surprise. One of them hoots and laughs as bolts of electricity burst out from the explosion.]\
\
[Jackson Brice powers down the weapon. The fingers sticking out from the end of the gun curl in on themselves, forming a loose fist.]\
\
Brice: Now, this is crafted from a reclaimed sub-Ultron arm straight from Sokovia. Here. You try.\
\
[Brice hands over the weapon to Aaron Davis, who takes it.]\
\
Aaron: Man, I wanted something low-key. Why are you trying to upsell me, man?\
\
[Behind them, Peter silently crawls down the side of the bridge.]\
\
Brice: Okay, okay, okay. I got what you need, all right? I got tons of great stuff here. One sec.\
\
[Hiding, Peter watches as Brice walks up to his van and looks inside. Spider-Man\'92s eyes narrow. The back of the van is full of machinery and weapons.]\
\
Brice: Okay, I got, uh, black hole grenades, Chitauri railguns...\
\
Schultz: You letting off shots in public now? Hurry up. Look, times are changing. We\'92re the only ones selling these high tech weapons.\
\
Peter: (whispers) Oh, this must be where the ATM robbers got their stuff.\
\
Aaron: I need something to stick up somebody. I\'92m not trying to shoot them back in time.\
\
Brice: I got anti-grav climbers.\
\
Aaron: Yo, climbers?\
\
[Suddenly, a yodeling ringtone plays. The weapon dealers look around, alarmed.]\
\
Brice: Okay, what the hell was that?\
\
[The phone continues to ring. Peter takes his phone out to check caller ID. Ned is making a funny face on the screen. Schultz aims his gun at Aaron.]\
\
Schultz: Did you set us up?\
\
Aaron: Hey, hey, man.\
\
[Peter flips off the wall and lands on the ground.]\
\
Peter: Hey! Hey, come on. You gonna shoot at somebody, shoot at me.\
\
Schultz: All right.\
\
[Schultz turns the gun on Peter, but Peter shoots his web, disarms Schultz, and charges. Using a high tech gauntlet from his van, Brice punches Peter with a burst of energy. Peter slams into the side of the bridge and lands on the ground.]\
\
[Schultz jumps in and starts the car. Brice, laughing triumphantly, jumps onto the back of the van as his accomplice drives off.]\
\
Peter: What was that?\
\
[Peter shoots his web, attaching it to the weapon dealers\'92 open van door.]\
\
[The van drags in through a neighborhood, knocking Peter into a trash can.]\
\
Peter: What? Ah!\
\
[He shoots a second strand of web.]\
\
Schultz: We gotta call him.\
\
Brice: No, no, no, no.\
\
[Brice readies another high tech weapon. Outside, Peter is holding on with two thin lines of web, trying to maintain balance. Brice fires another burst of energy. It breaks off the van door.]\
\
Schultz: Did you just do it again?\
\
Brice: Shut up.\
\
Schultz: I\'92m calling him.\
\
[We see a phone buzzing on a table littered with computer chips and various tools. Mason picks it up. Glancing around, he answers it.]\
\
Mason: Toomes\'92 phone.\
\
[He cringes at the sound of combat coming from the other end. Toomes is working nearby, welding something, when Mason calls for him.]\
\
Mason: Boss.\
\
[Peter is still being dragged through the neighborhood, clinging to the back of the van.]\
\
Peter: Oh, my butt! Unh!\
\
[Brice powers more energy blasts at Peter, causing him to lose his grasp on one of the webs. Just as Brice powers up the weapon once more, the van meets a road bump. The whole car wobbles, making Brice accidentally fire a hole in the van. He drops the weapon and it rolls out of the vehicle. The weapons comes to a stop in someone's yard.]\
\
[Schultz makes a sharp turn, making Peter slam into the side of a parked car. Peter then gets dragged through a line of garbage bins. He hits a solid brick pillar and drops to the ground along with a heap of bricks. Peter\'92s webs break off. Schultz checks the side mirror. Peter has recovered from the collision. He runs to get a clean shot and extends his hand. The web travels through the air and attaches itself to the remaining van door, but the door breaks off, already weakened by the rough treatment it received. Peter throws his arms up, exasperated.]\
\
Peter: Great. Guess I\'92m gonna have to take a shortcut.\
\
[Peter jogs on the sidewalk, jumps over a tall metal gate, and slides over a parked car. Two men are playing ping-pong in a garage as Peter runs across the yard.]\
\
Peter: Hey, guys. Good game. Have fun.\
\
[The neighbors stop their game and gape after Spider-Man in disbelief. A dog runs into Peter, barking and standing on its hind legs to lick Peter\'92s face. Peter retrieves a ball with his web and throws it to the side for the dog.]\
\
Peter: Hey, hey, buddy. Sorry, no time to play. Here, go fetch.\
\
[Peter swings through the neighborhood, hanging on tree branches and streetlights.]\
\
Peter: Whoo! Now, this is more like it.\
\
[He glides into another yard. Shooting his web, he accidentally holds onto a treehouse and knocks it off the tree. That makes him lose his grasp and land hard on the roof of a shed. It collapses under his weight.]\
\
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa!\
\
[After a few awkward banging noises, Peter rips through the door, runs across the yard, and slams through a wooden fence. He leaps into the air only to land on a small toy car, which rolls forward. Losing his balance, Peter gets tangled in a soccer net and stumbles through the hedge.]\
\
Peter: Whoa.\
\
[He waves his hand to a man having a barbecue in his own backyard.]\
\
Peter: Smells really good!\
\
[\'93Ferris Bueller\'92s Day Off\'94 is playing on the television at a pool party, the sequence closely resembling Peter\'92s travel through the neighborhood. Suddenly, Peter flies into frame.]\
\
Peter: Great movie!\
\
[Peter skims over the pool, splashing water over the partygoers and making them scream in surprise. He then gets tangled in fairy lights and crash lands on another yard, right beside two little girls having a sleepover in a tent. The eyes on his mask malfunction, fluttering open and close in a creepy fashion.]\
\
Peter: Ugh... Oh, hey, guys.\
\
Tent Kids: Aahhh!\
\
Peter: No! No!\
\
[The tent flips over in the girls\'92 overzealous attempt to escape.]\
\
[Ned stealthily brings his phone up to his ear, only to reach Peter\'92s voicemail.]\
\
Peter: (on recording) Hey, it\'92s Peter. Leave a message.\
\
[The phone plays a beeping tone.]\
\
Ned: (whispers) Peter, where are you? The hat\'92s not working. This is not cool.\
\
[The van zooms down the suburban street. Smoke is billowing out from the back of it. Peter falls from above, narrowly missing the car.]\
\
Peter: Almost got you.\
\
[He knocks over some garbage bins in his attempt to leap up onto a roof. Running across the roofs of neighboring houses, Peter tries his best to keep the van in sight. Slates become loose and fall off the roof under Peter\'92s feet.]\
\
Peter: (panting) Thought you got away from me, didn\'92t you? I got you right where I want you.\
\
[Finally catching up, Peter jumps toward the van.]\
\
Peter: Surprise!\
\
[Suddenly, Vulture snatches him from behind, flying in the wing suit, and soars high. Peter screams, looking down.]\
\
Peter: What the hell?\
\
[Peter wrestles to pull his leg free from Vulture\'92s grasp. Noticing the struggle, Vulture trains his glowing eyes at Peter menacingly and carries him even higher. Suddenly, the spider drawn on the back of Peter\'92s suit starts to beep and blink. A parachute unfolds itself from the hidden compartment. The air resistance from it makes rips Peter from Vulture\'92s grasp. During his descent, Peter gets wrapped up in the fabric.]\
\
Peter: Aahhhh!\
\
[Peter\'92s chaotic point of view shows him plunging toward the city.]\
\
[Peter plunges into a lake. He struggles to free himself from the parachute as he sinks deeper and deeper.]\
\
[Up above, the surface is calm, not betraying Peter\'92s desperate fight underwater. A figure dives into the water in an admirably fast speed. Iron Man emerges, carrying Peter. Holding him under his arms. Peter\'92s head hang slumped. The eyes on his mask blink open.]\
\
Peter: Huh? Oh, hey.\
\
[Peter wrings his mask. Water drips from it. He is sitting on a jungle gym. In front of him, Iron Man is floating in the air.]\
\
Peter: And then he just, he just, like, swooped down like a monster and he picked me up and, uh, he took me up, like, a thousand feet and just dropped me. How\'92d you find me? Did you put a tracker in my suit or something?\
\
Tony: I put everything in your suit. Including this heater.\
\
Peter: Whoa!\
\
[The suit is dried instantly. Steam rises from it, surrounding Peter.]\
\
Peter: Whew, that\'92s better. Thanks.\
\
[Peter shivers, his teeth chattering.]\
\
Tony: What were you thinking?\
\
Peter: The guy with the wings is obviously the source of the weapons. I gotta take him down.\
\
Tony: Take him down now, huh? Steady, Crockett, there are people who handle this sort of thing.\
\
Peter: The Avengers?\
\
Tony: No, no, no. This is a little below their pay grade.\
\
Peter: Anyway, Mr. Stark, you didn\'92t have to come all the way out here. I had that. I was fine.\
\
Tony: Oh, I\'92m not here.\
\
[Iron Man\'92s helmet opens, revealing an empty space where Tony\'92s face should have been.]\
\
[We are in India. Tony is dressed in a white kurta and wearing a red scarf around his neck. Behind him, Indian women in saris and garlands are participating in a traditional wedding.]\
\
Tony: Thank God this place has Wi-Fi or you would be toast right now. Thank Ganesh while you\'92re at it.\
\
[A man brings Tony a drink. Tony makes a small toast, whispering his gratitude.]\
\
Tony: Cheers.\
\
[Tony continues to talk through the empty suit, his helmet still open.]\
\
Tony: Look, forget the flying vulture guy, please.\
\
Peter: Why?\
\
Tony: Why? Because I said so!\
\
[A woman walks to him. Tony demurely bends down in order to help her put a flower garland around his neck.]\
\
Tony: Sorry, I\'92m talking to a teenager. (to Peter) Stay close to the ground. Build up your game helping little people, like that lady that bought you the churro. Can\'92t you just be a friendly...\
\
[Tony takes a sip from his drink and puts it down with a clink.]\
\
Tony: ...neighborhood Spider-Man?\
\
Peter: But I\'92m ready for more than that now.\
\
Tony: No, you are not.\
\
[The empty Iron Man suit closes.]\
\
Peter: That is not what you thought when I took on Captain America.\
\
Tony: Trust me, kid. If Cap wanted to lay you out, he would\'92ve. Listen to me. If you come across these weapons again, call Happy.\
\
[Peter hears a car engine revving.]\
\
Peter: Are you driving?\
\
[Tony gets in his car and shuts the door.]\
\
Tony: You know, it\'92s never too early to start thinking about college. I got some pull at MIT. (at his phone) End call.\
\
[Tony drives off in his yellow Audi.]\
\
Peter: No, I don\'92t need to go to col- Mr. Stark-\
\
Friday: Mr. Stark is no longer connected.\
\
[The Iron Man suit flies off. Peter mutters grudgingly.]\
\
Peter: That\'92s awesome.\
\
[Peter approaches an empty yard, wearing his mask again.]\
\
Peter: (mutters) Stay close to the ground? What is he talking about?\
\
[He stops walking, spotting something. Peter enters the yard and finds a piece of Brice\'92s damaged weapon that had fallen out of the vehicle. He crouches down to tentatively flip it over with his fingertips.]\
\
Peter: Whoa.\
\
[Peter finds the glowing energy core. His phone rings. Peter answers a call from Ned.]\
\
Peter: Hey, man, what\'92s up? I\'92m on my way back.\
\
Ned: Actually, I was calling to say maybe you shouldn\'92t come. Listen to this.\
\
[Ned pulls his phone off his ear and raises it into the air.]\
\
Flash: When I say \'93penis,\'94 you say \'93Parker.\'94 Penis!\
\
Crowd: Parker!\
\
Flash: Penis!\
\
Crowd: Parker!\
\
[Peter can still hear Flash and his friends chanting in the background.]\
\
Ned: Sorry, Peter. I guess we\'92re still losers. I\'92ll see you tomorrow.\
\
Peter: I\'92ll see you tomorrow in school.\
\
[Peter hangs up and carefully lifts the weapon. Metal and wires encase the glowing core. Peter looks up, determination clear on his masked face.]\
\
[In Toomes' warehouse, Mason is working on a small device which is glowing with a purple hue similar to the core of Peter\'92s discovery. He blows on the end of the soldering tool and picks up a glowing cube. Mason throws the cube into a refrigerator, creating a rectangular portal. He reaches through it and grabs a drink.]\
\
Mason: Whoa, whoa.\
\
[The room shakes, making the cube parts fall off the refrigerator and closing the small opening. Toomes lands on the platform in his vulture suit. Stepping out of the suit, he walks down the stairs, stomping angrily.]\
\
Toomes: Idiots. Idiots.\
\
[He throws his helmet.]\
\
Toomes: Idiots!\
\
[A worker looks up at Vulture, alarmed.]\
\
Mason: Boss. Your wife keeps texting you. Something about a brake light?\
\
[Vulture approaches Mason.]\
\
Toomes: What\'92d I tell you about looking at my phone?\
\
Mason: Oh, sorry. You left it out. You know I\'92m a curious person by nature.\
\
[Toomes takes the phone.]\
\
Mason: I finished designing that high-altitude vacuum seal.\
\
Toomes: Huh?\
\
Mason: In case you want to, you know, go for the big one?\
\
Toomes: You\'92re still on that? I told you, no. The answer\'92s no. Forget it.\
\
[The badly damaged van pulls into the warehouse. Vulture and Mason look at it curiously. Brice appears from the back of the van, not bothering to open the nonexistent doors which got ripped out during their fight with Spider-Man.]\
\
Brice: Whoo!\
\
[Smiling, Brice takes off his hand-weapon and reaches Vulture.]\
\
Brice: I mean, that was badass.\
\
[Annoyed, Toomes walks toward Brice.]\
\
Toomes: How many times have I told you not to fire them out in the open?\
\
Brice: You said, move the merchandise.\
\
Toomes: Under the radar. Under the radar! That\'92s how we survive. If you bring Damage Control or the Avengers down here, we\'92re through. You\'92re out there wearing that goofy thing, lightning up cars, calling yourself the Shocker. \'93I\'92m the Shocker. I shock people.\'94 What is this, pro wrestling?\
\
Brice: Ah, whatever, old man. Come on.\
\
[Brice walks to a table and Vulture follows.]\
\
Toomes: Look, look. I know you don\'92t give a crap about anything. But I do. I built this whole place because I got people I have to look after.\
\
Brice: (mockingly) Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\
\
[Vulture stares at Brice, his expression cold.]\
\
Toomes: You know what? I can\'92t afford your bullshit. Get out of here.\
\
Brice: What?\
\
Toomes: You\'92re done. You\'92re off the crew.\
\
Brice: Yeah, all right. All right. Wonder if you can afford me out there, though, right? With everything I know.\
\
[Brice walks off.]\
\
Toomes: Excuse me?\
\
Brice: Um, I\'92m just saying...\
\
[Vulture looks at Brice, properly annoyed.]\
\
Brice: ...maybe your wife would like to know where you really get your money from.\
\
Toomes: You know what?\
\
Brice: What?\
\
Toomes: You\'92re right. (to Mason, in a low voice) That work?\
\
Mason: I don\'92t know.\
\
[Vulture looks at Brice again.]\
\
Toomes: I can\'92t afford that.\
\
[Vulture picks up and fires the high-tech weapon which Mason was working on. A blue ray zaps Brice, burning him down to ashes. Brice\'92s gauntlet clatters to the ground. The weapon powers down. Vulture looks on, a little confused. Schultz eyes the ashes.]\
\
Schultz: Damn.\
\
[Still confused, Vulture speaks to Mason.]\
\
Toomes: I thought this was the antigravity gun.\
\
Mason: What? No, that\'92s that one.\
\
[Mason points to another weapon. Dropping the weapon on the worktable, Vulture approaches Brice\'92s remains. He picks up the Shocker\'92s gauntlet and cleans off the ashes. He then tosses the gauntlet to Schultz.]\
\
Toomes: Here. Now you\'92re the Shocker. Go out there and find that weapon he lost.\
\
Schultz: All right.\
\
[Vulture walks off.]\
\
[In shop class, Peter hits the weapon core casing with a hammer. The core emits purple light as it is partially freed from the metal casing.]\
\
Peter: Oh.\
\
[He starts to pull it apart. Ned joins him.]\
\
Ned: Hey, thanks for bailing on me.\
\
Peter: Yeah, well, something came up.\
\
[Ned spots the glowing core.]\
\
Ned: Oh, what is that?\
\
[Peter struggles to take the machine apart.]\
\
Peter: I don\'92t know. Some guy tried to vaporize me with it.\
\
Ned: Seriously?\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Ned: Awesome.\
\
[Peter looks at Ned at the absurd reaction.]\
\
Ned: I mean, not awesome. Totally uncool of that guy. So scary.\
\
[Peter gives Ned a look and continues to work at the casing.]\
\
Peter: Well, look, I think it\'92s a power source.\
\
Ned: Yeah, but it\'92s connected to all these microprocessors. That\'92s an inductive charging plate. That\'92s what I use to charge my toothbrush.\
\
[Ned points at a complex-looking charging mechanism connected to various wires.]\
\
Peter: Whoever\'92s making these weapons is obviously combining alien tech with ours.\
\
Ned: That is literally the coolest sentence anyone has ever said. I just want to thank you for letting me be part of your journey into this amazing-\
\
[Peter is not listening to a word he\'92s saying. He brings up a hammer and hits the core really hard. The core pops out from its place, glowing. Peter and Ned immediately look at the teacher. The teacher is reading a book, sitting in his chair. He does not even spare a glance at the commotion they are causing.]\
\
Mr. Hapgood: Keep your fingers clear of the blades.\
\
[Peter and Ned turn back and look at the core which popped out.]\
\
Peter: I gotta figure out what this thing is and who makes it.\
\
Ned: We\'92ll go to the lab after class and run some tests.\
\
[We see the core glowing on the table.]\
\
Peter: Let\'92s do it.\
\
[Peter and Ned share a complicated secret handshake.]\
\
[Peter and Ned are walking down the hallway.]\
\
Ned: First, I say we put the glowy thing in the mass spectrometer.\
\
Peter: First, we gotta come up with a better name than \'93glowy thingy.\'94\
\
Ned: You\'92re right.\
\
[Schultz and Randy walk in. Peter spots them and freezes instantly.]\
\
Peter: Crap.\
\
[He throws himself behind a wall.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on.\
\
[Ned looks around, then shuffles across the corridor to join Peter by a classroom window. Behind them, the chess club is peacefully playing a game. Peter peers around the corner.]\
\
Schultz: High schools creep me out.\
\
[Peter and Ned peer at them.]\
\
Schultz: They got this funny smell, you know?\
\
[Peter and Ned hide behind the wall again. They carry out a whispered conversation.]\
\
Peter: Hey, that\'92s one of the guys that tried to kill me.\
\
Ned: What?\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Ned: We gotta get out of here.\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no, no. I gotta follow them. Maybe they can lead me to the guy that dropped me in the lake.\
\
Ned: Someone dropped you in a lake?\
\
Peter: Yeah, it was not good.\
\
[Schultz and Randy enter a classroom.]\
\
Ned: (whispers) Peter-\
\
Peter: (whispers) No. Stay there, Ned.\
\
[Peter raises an arm to stop Ned and sneaks away.]\
\
Ned: (whispers) Peter.\
\
[Ned is left standing alone. Through the window, Brian "Tiny" McKeever notices him. He knocks on the window, making Ned turn around, startled.]\
\
Tiny: What are you doing?\
\
Ned: (in a normal voice) Nothing.\
\
[Down the hall, Peter is trailing the two men. Ned tries to act nonchalant.]\
\
Tiny: Oh.\
\
Ned: Yeah. You good?\
\
Tiny: Chess.\
\
[Peter sneaks down a staircase into the classroom. Schultz and Randy are rummaging through the room.]\
\
Randy: Can you imagine what the boss would say if he knew where we were?\
\
Schultz: It\'92s saying there was an energy pulse right here.\
\
[Peter slowly walks down the stairs and takes off his bag.]\
\
Randy: There\'92s no sign of the weapon. And even if it was here, now it\'92s gone.\
\
Schultz: So are we.\
\
[Schultz looks in Peter\'92s direction. We see no one there. An upside-down chair standing on the table shakes a little. Spotting the anomaly, Schultz gets closer, putting his hand on his gun. He crosses the room and pauses by the worktable, scanning the area. As the men head out, we tilt down to reveal Peter clinging under the table. He shoots a tiny robotic spider at one of the men\'92s shoes. It stealthily climbs up the man\'92s leg.]\
\
[Sitting in Peter's room, Ned holds the web-shooter. It projects a hologram model of the city. Peter hops onto the bed next to Ned.]\
\
Ned: This is so awesome.\
\
Peter: I know, right?\
\
[Ned pokes it and the model becomes more defined.]\
\
Peter: They\'92re in Brooklyn.\
\
[Later. Ned is still studying the hologram and Peter is hanging upside down, eating chips.]\
\
Ned: Staten Island.\
\
[Night has fallen. Ned lies on the floor while Peter works at his desk. Ned glances at the hologram.]\
\
Ned: Leaving Jersey.\
\
[With a shooter, Peter projects a characterized image of his mask on the wall.]\
\
[Later. Ned now lies on the bed. The hologram model starts to beep. Startled, he sits up, wearing the Spider-Man mask. He grabs the hologram model next to him.]\
\
Ned: They stopped.\
\
[Peter pops into frame, hanging from the ceiling. He turns around, a little groggy, and eyes the model.]\
\
Peter: Maryland?\
\
Ned: What\'92s there?\
\
Peter: I don\'92t know. Evil lair?\
\
Ned: They have a lair?\
\
Peter: Dude. A gang with alien guns run by a guy with wings? Yeah, they have a lair.\
\
Ned: (nods) Badass. But how are you gonna get there if it\'92s, like, 300 miles away?\
\
[They simultaneously turn to face the Academic Decathlon poster.]\
\
Peter: It\'92s not too far from D.C.\
\
[Midtown High students are waiting by a yellow bus, dressed in their yellow uniform jackets. Peter runs toward them.]\
\
Abe: Hey, it\'92s Peter.\
\
Peter: Guys.\
\
Liz: Peter?\
\
Friend: Hey, buddy.\
\
Peter: Yeah, I was hoping maybe I could rejoin the team.\
\
[Flash, standing in the back, walks forward to face Peter.]\
\
Flash: No, no way. You can\'92t just quit on us, stroll up, and be welcomed back by everyone.\
\
[The teacher walks out of the bus.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Hey, welcome back, Peter. Flash, you\'92re back to first alternate.\
\
Flash: What?\
\
Abe: He\'92s taking your place.\
\
[Michelle appears behind them, sans uniform.]\
\
Michelle: Excuse me, can we go already? \'91Cause I was hoping to get in some light protesting in front of one of the embassies before dinner, so.\
\
Mr. Harrington: Protesting is patriotic. Let\'92s get on the bus.\
\
[Flash shrugs off his jacket and sullenly thrusts it into Peter\'92s arms.]\
\
[The bus is travelling through the highway. 90 miles to Baltimore, 126 miles to Washington.]\
\
Liz: Focus up, everyone. Our next topic is the moons of Saturn.\
\
[The students are holding bells, focusing on Liz\'92s quiz. They ring their bells before answering.]\
\
Cindy: The second law of thermodynamics.\
\
Charles: Frank Sinatra.\
\
Flash: Fort Sumter.\
\
Abe: Flash is wrong.\
\
Liz: Okay, guys, let\'92s focus. Next one.\
\
Mr. Harrington: Liz, don\'92t overwork them.\
\
Peter: Uh, strontium, barium, vibranium.\
\
Liz: Very good, Peter. Glad to have you back.\
\
Peter: Glad to be back.\
\
[Peter\'92s phone vibrates. He takes it out to see that Happy is calling him.]\
\
Liz: What is the current standard unit of radioactive-\
\
Peter: Can I take this real quick? I\'92ll only be a sec.\
\
Liz: Yeah, fine.\
\
[Peter answers his call, moving to the back seats. As he passes by, Michelle stares at him curiously, looking up from her book.]\
\
Peter: Hello?\
\
[Happy is talking on the phone in the Avengers Tower. Behind him, workers are carrying things.]\
\
Happy: Got a blip on my screen here. You left New York?\
\
[Decathlon practice continues in the background.]\
\
Liz: Okay, focus up, everyone.\
\
Peter: Tracker.\
\
[Peter holds the phone away from his mouth and mutters.]\
\
Peter: (in a normal voice) Uh, yeah. No, it\'92s just a school trip. It\'92s, uh, it\'92s nothing.\
\
[Peter sits in the back of the bus, next row to Ned.]\
\
Peter: Look, Happy, I gotta say, you tracking me without my permission is a complete violation of my privacy.\
\
[Ned points at the hologram model.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) That\'92s different.\
\
[Happy looks suspicious.]\
\
Happy: What\'92s different?\
\
Peter: Nothing. Look, it\'92s just the Academic Decathlon. It\'92s no big deal.\
\
Happy: Hey, hey. I\'92ll decide if it\'92s no big deal.\
\
[Peter looks annoyed. He mouths, \'93what?\'94]\
\
Happy: Sounds like it\'92s no big deal, but remember, I\'92m watching you.\
\
[The bus approaches Washington D.C. Above the hotel entrance, we see a banner announcing the \'93United States Academic Decathlon.\'94]\
\
[The Decathlon team arrives in the check-in area. We see the interior of the hotel which is filled with preparations for the Decathlon. The students and teacher look on in awe as they walk in. Liz is at their front, leading everyone.]\
\
Liz: Everyone stick together.\
\
Mr. Harrington: Yeah.\
\
Charles: You kidding me? This place is huge.\
\
Flash: I\'92ve seen bigger.\
\
Abe: There\'92s a bird in here.\
\
Peter: (to Ned) Hey, you brought your laptop, right?\
\
Ned: Why?\
\
[The door to Peter and Ned's hotel room closes. The do not disturb sign is hanging on its handle. Peter and Ned unpack, shaking various belongings like wires, the purple weapon core, toothpaste, and braces out of their backpacks. Peter connects a wire to the suit. Ned is using his laptop, complicated lines of codes flashing through the screen. Peter holds a flashlight with his mouth, working on his suit.]\
\
Ned: Peter, why are we removing the tracker from your suit?\
\
Peter: Uh, because I gotta follow these guys to their boss before they move again and I don\'92t really want Mr. Stark to know about it.\
\
Ned: So you\'92re lying to Iron Man now?\
\
Peter: No, I\'92m not lying. He just doesn\'92t really get what I can do yet.\
\
[Ned warily eyes his friend. Peter removes the tracking device from the suit.]\
\
Peter: Ah... Gotcha.\
\
[He takes the flashlight out of his mouth.]\
\
Peter: All right, Happy. Enjoy tracking this lamp.\
\
[Peter sticks the device on a lamp, then gets back to the suit. Ned is still working on the laptop.]\
\
Ned: There\'92s a ton of other subsystems in here...\
\
Peter: Hmm?\
\
Ned: (smirks) ...but they\'92re all disabled by the Training Wheels Protocol.\
\
Peter: What?\
\
[Peter hops up next to Ned and looks at the screen. The words \'93Training Wheels Protocol\'94 are written in red. The codes declare that the protocol is currently active and that \'93Stark Industry Key Identifier\'94 should be entered to disable it.]\
\
Peter: \'93Training Wheels Protocol?\'94\
\
[Ned chuckles.]\
\
Peter: Turn it off.\
\
Ned: I don\'92t think that\'92s a good idea. I mean, they\'92re probably blocked for a reason.\
\
Peter: Come on, man. I don\'92t need training wheels.\
\
[Peter steps onto his bed and jumps up and down.]\
\
Peter: I\'92m sick of him treating me like a kid all the time. It\'92s not cool.\
\
Ned: But you are a kid.\
\
Peter: Yeah, a kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands.\
\
Ned: Peter, I just don\'92t think this is a great idea. I mean, what if this is illegal?\
\
[Peter jumps down to kneel beside Ned.]\
\
Peter: Look, please. This is my chance to prove myself. I can handle it. Ned, come on.\
\
Ned: I really don\'92t think this is a good idea.\
\
Peter: (whispers) The guy in the chair.\
\
Ned: Don\'92t do that.\
\
Peter: Come on.\
\
[Ned sighs and types reluctantly. A blue flash of light briefly pulses through the suit. Peter and Ned look at it.]\
\
[Peter, wearing the suit without the mask, zips up his sweat shirt to hide it and puts on his hood. He peeks out the door and looks around. The corridors are quiet and empty.]\
\
Peter: Yeah, the glowy thing, it\'92s evidence. Keep it safe.\
\
[Ned picks up the glowing core.]\
\
Peter: All right?\
\
Ned: Okay, okay.\
\
[Peter activates the tracker.]\
\
Peter: They\'92re moving.\
\
[Peter hurriedly walks out of the room.]\
\
Ned: Be careful.\
\
[As Peter tries to walk down the hall unnoticed, Liz approaches in a bathing suit.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Liz.\
\
Liz: (whispers) Perfect timing. We\'92re gonna go swimming. Come on, come on, come on.\
\
[She waves the other students forward.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) What?\
\
[The teenagers sneak by, laughing quietly.]\
\
Sally: Hey, Peter.\
\
Cindy: Hi.\
\
[Flash slaps Peter\'92s butt.]\
\
Peter: Hey!\
\
[Peter squeals in a high tone, offended.]\
\
Peter: I was, uh... I was gonna go study, um, in the business center.\
\
Liz: Peter, you don\'92t need to study. You\'92re, like, the smartest guy I\'92ve ever met.\
\
[Peter looks at Liz, bewitched.]\
\
Liz: And besides... Um, a rebellious group activity the day before competition is good for morale.\
\
Peter: Hmm?\
\
Liz: Um, well, I read that in a TED Talk, so, I-I heard it in a TED Talk. And I read a coaching book.\
\
[Liz smiles and nods.]\
\
Peter: Wow, you really... This is really important to you.\
\
Liz: Yeah. It\'92s our future. I\'92m not gonna screw it up. Besides, we raided the minibar and these candy bars were, like, eleven dollars. So get your trunks on and come on.\
\
[Liz throws a candy bar at Peter in a smooth arc.]\
\
Charles: Come on.\
\
Sally: Come on.\
\
Liz: I\'92m coming, I\'92m coming.\
\
[Liz catches up with the others.]\
\
[At an indoor swimming pool, the Decathlon teammates swim. Liz sits on a wall between the pool and a spa.]\
\
[Wearing his suit without the mask, Peter watches Liz through a window on the roof. Liz playfully chats with her teammates. Peter sighs. Stepping back from the window, he tightens the straps on his backpack. Peter puts on the mask. A brief glow expands from the spider emblem on his chest.]\
\
Suit Lady: Good evening, Peter.\
\
Peter: Hello? Hello?\
\
Suit Lady: Congratulations on completing the rigorous Training Wheels Protocol and gaining access to your suit\'92s full capabilities.\
\
[We see Peter\'92s view from inside the spider suit, quickly changing to different view modes.]\
\
Peter: Ah, thank you.\
\
Suit Lady: So where would you like to take me tonight?\
\
Peter: (stuttering) S, I, I, put a tracker on someone. He\'92s a bad guy.\
\
Suit Lady: Tracker located.\
\
[We see the spider suit tracking down the path that leads to the guy Peter is after.]\
\
Suit Lady: Plotting course to intercept target.\
\
Peter: Okay, well, as long as I make it back in time for Decathlon, it\'92s fine.\
\
[Peter swings from a web and lands on a truck. As the truck runs past, we see a banner that says \'93United States Academic Decathlon.\'94]\
\
[Peter rides on a different truck, raging down the road. We see Peter in his spider suit crouching on top of the truck, with the dark night sky in the background.]\
\
Suit Lady: One hundred meters from destination and closing.\
\
[The truck roars past a patch of grass.]\
\
Suit Lady: Jump now.\
\
[Peter leaps off the truck and rolls down a grassy bank. He runs across the bank through the tall grass, approaching an abandoned gas station.]\
\
Suit Lady: Detecting three individuals.\
\
[We see Peter observing the gas station from behind his back. The station is dark, with a couple of trucks in its driveway. He stops and crouches to observe the gas station.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) Why is their secret lair in a gas station? That\'92s so lame.\
\
[Peter jumps, and climbs on top of the empty gas price sign.]\
\
Peter: Hey, suit lady, what are they doing?\
\
Suit Lady: Do you want to hear what they\'92re saying?\
\
Peter: I can hear what they\'92re saying? Uh, yeah.\
\
Suit Lady: Activating Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.\
\
[The spider suit display closes in on the van and shows Peter the heat signals emitted from the men inside. There are three people in the van who are quietly speaking.]\
\
Mason: I got the gauntlet from the Lagos cleanup. The rest is all my design.\
\
Peter: Whoa, that\'92s so cool.\
\
Randy: Can\'92t believe they\'92re still cleaning up that Triskelion mess.\
\
Schultz: I love it. They keep making messes, we keep getting rich.\
\
Mason: Target inbound.\
\
Peter: Whoa, they\'92re in the middle of a heist. I could catch them all red-handed. This is awesome. Okay, I\'92m gonna get a little closer so I can see what\'92s happening.\
\
Suit Lady: Would you like me to engage Enhanced Combat Mode?\
\
Peter: Uh, Enhanced Combat Mode? Yeah.\
\
Suit Lady: Activating Instant Kill.\
\
[The eyes of Peter\'92s spider suit turn into evil-looking tiny red dots.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don\'92t want to kill anybody!\
\
Suit Lady: Deactivating Instant Kill.\
\
[The eyes switch back to their normal width and color. Peter jumps off the sign and falls on his face on the hard asphalt ground. Peter grunts.]\
\
Schultz: Did you hear that?\
\
Peter: What the hell just happened? What was that?\
\
Suit Lady: You jumped off the sign and landed on your face.\
\
[He fires web pellets from his shooter which land on the gas station sign.]\
\
Peter: Suit lady, what\'92s wrong with my web-shooters?\
\
[Peter runs to hide behind a sign.]\
\
Suit Lady: Rapid-fire is the default for Enhanced Combat Mode.\
\
Peter: Why would I need rapid-fire?\
\
Suit Lady: Would you like to see more options?\
\
[We see Peter\'92s hands from his spider suit point of view. All kinds of webs are shown from which he can choose.]\
\
Suit Lady: You have 576 possible web-shooter combinations.\
\
Peter: Whoa, Mr. Stark really overdid it.\
\
[Inside the car:]\
\
Schultz: You two wait right here.\
\
Mason: Wait. You\'92re gonna want to turn on the dampers, though, or that thing will shatter your arm.\
\
Schultz: All right. Where\'92s the dampers?\
\
[Peter is still looking down at all the options for his webs displayed over his hands.]\
\
Peter: That one.\
\
Suit Lady: Great choice.\
\
[One of the options turn red.]\
\
Suit Lady: Would you like me to set this as your new default?\
\
[Peter shoots an electrified web at a neon sign, making it blink on and off.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no.\
\
[Through the window, we see Peter struggling with his electrified webs. He keeps shooting, and the neon sign keeps flashing. The men in the car are oblivious.]\
\
Mason: Push that in.\
\
Schultz: Right here?\
\
Mason: No, no, the other-\
\
Schultz: This one right here?\
\
Mason: Yeah, push. [Peter runs behind the gas station, away from the truck, and leaps on some trucks to reach the roof of the building.]\
\
Peter: What was that?\
\
Suit Lady: Taser webs.\
\
Peter: Taser webs? I don\'92t want taser webs.\
\
Suit Lady: You seem to be very unfamiliar with your web-shooter settings. Would you like to run a refresher course?\
\
[Peter sits on the roof to get a better look at the men.]\
\
Peter: No, just... You choose.\
\
Suit Lady: Sure thing.\
\
[Inside the DODC convoy truck:]\
\
DODC Central: Six-Alpha-Niner. Are you running on time?\
\
DODC Driver: Copy, Central. Six-Alpha-Niner on schedule.\
\
[Schultz, Vulture\'92s bald henchman, peers through binoculars. Three trucks are approaching the gas station.]\
\
Schultz: I have visual.\
\
Mason: Green light, green light.\
\
[Peter spots Vulture flying overhead in his wing suit.]\
\
Peter: Oh, that\'92s him.\
\
[Vulture soars over a convoy of transport trucks. The suit\'92s eyes glow green in the dark.]\
\
Vulture: Okay, I got eyes on the convoy. Pulling in behind the caboose.\
\
Mason: Deploy anchors.\
\
[Vulture fires cables onto the roof of the last truck. He drops a cube onto the trailer, which separates into four pieces. Arranged in a rectangle, they create a glowing portal through the roof.]\
\
Vulture: Dropping down.\
\
[Vulture detaches from his suit and falls through the portal, but the truck driver seems unaware of what\'92s happening.]\
\
[Inside the van, Mason speaks into his walkie-talkie, surrounded by wires and screens.]\
\
Mason: No outgoing distress signals. You\'92re all clear.\
\
[We see Vulture\'92s green-filtered view of the inside of the trailer. Cage-like boxes contain exotic items.]\
\
Vulture: Hey. Looks like they got some good stuff here.\
\
[He rips off the door from a cage full of tech. Peter climbs on top of the trailer and touches the portal. His fingers go through.]\
\
Peter: Whoa, cool. It\'92s some kind of matter phase shifter.\
\
[Peter crawls down the ceiling as Vulture rises into view. Vulture kneels and zips a duffel bag.]\
\
Vulture: Alright, coming up.\
\
[Vulture jumps through the portal and onto the roof of the trailer. Peter shoots a web at Vulture\'92s bag, pulling it away.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Big Bird! This doesn\'92t belong to you!\
\
[Vulture\'92s green eyes glare intimidatingly in Peter\'92s direction.]\
\
Peter: Oh, god.\
\
[Vulture gets into his wing suit and soars toward Peter. Peter jumps over him and fires long, weak webs past Vulture.]\
\
Peter: Suit lady, what was that?\
\
Suit Lady: You told me to choose.\
\
[Vulture attacks Peter and Peter tries to balance himself on the edge of the trailer.]\
\
Peter: What? No, just set everything back to normal.\
\
[Peter grabs Vulture\'92s duffel bag, and starts to tug.]\
\
Suit Lady: Activating all systems.\
\
[Peter rips the bag out of Vulture\'92s talons. He falls through the portal back into the truck. The portal cube is thrown off position by Peter\'92s movement. He immediately jumps up to get out but slams his head on the now solid roof. Peter loses consciousness. Cut to black.]\
\
[Time seems to have passed, and Peter lies motionless on the floor of the trailer. The truck shakes to a stop, waking Peter up.]\
\
Peter: Oh, my head.\
\
Suit Lady: You appear to have a mild concussion.\
\
[With a headache, Peter stands up with a hand to his head.]\
\
Peter: Hey, so where am I right now?\
\
[Peter looks around, but cannot figure out where he is.]\
\
Suit Lady: I\'92m not sure. The container walls are hindering my sensors.\
\
Peter: Wait a minute. They must have hijacked the truck and taken me to their evil lair. Okay, suit lady. We\'92re gonna have to fight our way out of this one.\
\
[Peter prepares himself to burst through the truck\'92s metal doors.]\
\
Peter: Three, two, one!\
\
[Peter smashes through the trailer doors, and finds himself in a huge warehouse full of containers. He looks around, on guard.]\
\
Peter: What is this place? Suit lady, where am I?\
\
Suit Lady: You\'92re in the most secure facility on the Eastern Seaboard. The Damage Control Deep Storage Vault.\
\
Peter: No. Seriously?\
\
[Shocked, Peter puts both hands to his head. On the wall before him, \'93DODC-V05\'94 is written in big black letters.]\
\
[Time has passed. Peter is clinging to the horizontal crack of the massive doors as he tries to wedge them open.]\
\
Suit Lady: The door will most likely remain closed until morning.\
\
[Peter kicks at the bottom of the doors.]\
\
Peter: (disappointed) Morning?\
\
[Later. Peter is lying on a hammock made out of his webs.]\
\
Peter: Hey, suit lady, I kind of feel bad calling you \'93suit lady,\'94 you know? I think I should probably give you a name... like Liz. No, no, no. God, that\'92s... that\'92s weird.\
\
[With one hand, Peter swings on a rope that is also made out of his webs, and lets go, dropping to the floor and lying down.]\
\
Peter: What about Karen?\
\
Suit Lady: You can call me Karen if you would like.\
\
[Peter reads a book hanging upside down. His web is held between his feet and suspending him from the ceiling.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Karen, what else can this suit do?\
\
[Wings expand from under his arms. Peter gasps in surprise.]\
\
Peter: What?\
\
[Standing in front of an empty wall, Peter is now wearing his yellow Midtown high school blazer over his suit. The suit is flashing a laser spider man emblem on the wall. Peter is examining the options for his web.]\
\
Peter: Maybe we should run that refresher course.\
\
Karen: Ricochet web.\
\
Peter: Ricochet web.\
\
[Peter shoots a ricochet web on the wall and it immediately bounces back. He ducks to dodge the ball-shaped bundle of web.]\
\
Peter: Whoa! Cool.\
\
[Later. The wall is covered with patches of spiderwebs now.]\
\
Karen: Splitter web.\
\
[Peter fires two strands of web.]\
\
[More time has passed. The wall is even messier.]\
\
Karen: Web grenade.\
\
[Peter jumps, and throws a small, metal-like ball of web.]\
\
Peter: Web grenade!\
\
[The web grenade explodes, and the web covers the wall even more.]\
\
[Later. Peter jump ropes with a strand of web.]\
\
[Later. Peter is lying face up on one of the trailers.]\
\
Peter: Should I tell Liz that I\'92m Spider-Man?\
\
Karen: Who is Liz?\
\
Peter: Who is Liz? She\'92s.. heh. She\'92s the best. She\'92s awesome. She, uh, she\'92s just a girl who goes to my school. And, uh... Yeah, I just... I really want to tell her, but it\'92s kind of weird, you know? \'93Hey, I\'92m... I\'92m Spider-Man.\'94\
\
Karen: What\'92s weird about that?\
\
Peter: What if she\'92s expecting someone like Tony Stark? I mean, imagine how disappointed she\'92d be when she sees me.\
\
Karen: Well, if I were her, I wouldn\'92t be disappointed at all.\
\
Peter: Thanks, Karen. It\'92s really nice to have somebody to talk to. Hey, how long we been here anyways?\
\
Karen: Thirty seven minutes.\
\
Peter: What? Thirty seven minutes?\
\
[Peter sits up, unable to control the frustration.]\
\
Peter: That\'92s insane. I cannot take this anymore. I gotta... I gotta get out of here.\
\
[Peter flips off a container and walks into it. He sighs and takes off his blazers and his hoodie.]\
\
Peter: There\'92s got to be something in here I can use.\
\
[He opens Vulture\'92s duffel bag.]\
\
Peter: Okay, let\'92s see.\
\
[Peter inspects a wheel-shaped metal piece then throws it away.]\
\
Peter: Nope.\
\
[He pulls out a Ultron head.]\
\
Peter: That\'92s awesome. [The Ultron head makes a clanging sound as it is discarded on the floor. Peter holds a purple glowing object.]\
\
Peter: Ah, hey, it\'92s like the glowy thing.\
\
Karen: That glowy thing is an explosive Chitauri energy core.\
\
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! You mean, we\'92ve been carrying around a bomb?\
\
Karen: It would require radiation to transform it into an explosive state.\
\
[Peter finds his phone and tries to call Ned but can\'92t get any reception.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no, no.\
\
[Peter uses webs to swing to the warehouse doors. Clinging onto the doors, he starts banging and shouting, hoping someone would hear him.]\
\
Peter: Hey! Please! Please, somebody, let me out! Hey! Karen, you have to help me override that time lock.\
\
[Peter hangs upside down from the ceiling next to the time lock close to the doors. He has opened the lock panel and is now putting in numbers. In his hands are a notepad and a pen.]\
\
Peter: Okay Karen. Lower the voltage and run it.\
\
Karen: Trial unsuccessful.\
\
Peter: Okay, we\'92re just gonna have to try every sequence.\
\
[Peter crosses out the wrong sequence on his notepad.]\
\
[The sun is rising over the Washington D.C.]\
\
[At the hotel, Ned waits in his room. Someone knocks on the door.]\
\
Student: Ned, Peter, we\'92re gonna be late. Come on, let\'92s go.\
\
Ned: Okay, hold on, hold on.\
\
[Ned grabs the energy core.]\
\
[Peter is still trying to override the lock. He yawns, then presses some buttons.]\
\
Karen: Initiating trial 247.\
\
[The massive warehouse doors groan as they open.]\
\
Peter: It worked! It works!\
\
[Peter swings out on his webs through the opening doors. Peter crawls on the ceiling outside, then drops on the trailer of a departing truck. He lies down as the truck passes an armed guard.]\
\
[The students are entering the Decathlon venue.]\
\
Moderator: Please be sure all cell phones are turned off.\
\
[Ned hand his phone in to the security.]\
\
Security: Thank you.\
\
[Peter is standing on the back of a trailer truck. A ringing tone is heard in the background.]\
\
Peter: Karen, you have to get me to Decathlon as fast as possible.\
\
Karen: Sure thing. Just tell me where it is.\
\
Peter: Right across the street from the Washington Monument.\
\
[We see Peter holding his phone to his ear.]\
\
Ned: Hey, it\'92s Ned. Leave a message.\
\
Peter: Ned, call me back! The glowy thing is a bomb!\
\
[At the Decathlon, the students are scribbling. We pan down to see the purple energy core glowing in Ned\'92s pocket.]\
\
Karen: There\'92s a vehicle approaching on your right.\
\
[Peter grunts, and climbs on top of the cargo.]\
\
Moderator: We have now entered sudden death.\
\
[The students prepare themselves, trying to be calm and placing their hands on their buzzers. Flash takes a deep breath, clearly nervous.]\
\
[The scene cuts over to Peter as he leaps on a SUV.]\
\
Moderator: The next correct answer wins the championship.\
\
[Michelle hits the answer bell with a bored, impassive look.]\
\
Moderator: Midtown Tech?\
\
Michelle: Zero.\
\
Moderator: That is correct. Midtown takes the championship!\
\
[Ned hugs Michelle and she smiles. More Midtown students pile in for a group hug.]\
\
[The Midtown High students are walking toward the Washington Monument.]\
\
Student: We won!\
\
Liz: You guys, I am so proud of you.\
\
Flash: Told you we didn\'92t need Peter.\
\
Ned: Flash, you didn\'92t answer a single question.\
\
[Michelle is standing alone with a book.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Taking it all in, Michelle?\
\
Michelle: Oh, yeah, I just... um, I don\'92t really want to celebrate something that was built by slaves.\
\
Mr. Harrington: Oh, I\'92m sure the Washington Monument wasn\'92t built by-\
\
[Mr. Harrington looks up at the monument. A park ranger wobbles his hand as a confirmation to Michelle\'92s words. Mr. Harrington purses his lips and walks away.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Okay. Enjoy your book.\
\
Michelle: Thanks.\
\
[Peter swings on top of a bus. Peter and Ned finally reach each other on the phone.]\
\
Peter: Oh, Ned, you\'92re alive!\
\
[Ned is at the Washington Monument, about to get a security check.]\
\
Ned: (whispers) Peter, are you okay?\
\
Peter: Ned, Ned, where\'92s the glowy thing, the glowy thing?\
\
Ned: Don\'92t worry, it\'92s safe. It\'92s in my backpack.\
\
[Ned puts his backpack down on the conveyor belt for an X-ray security scan.]\
\
Peter: No, Ned, listen! No, no, Ned, the glowy thing is dangerous.\
\
Ned: You missed the Decathlon. I covered for you.\
\
Peter: Ned, listen to me!\
\
Ned: We\'92re at the Washington Monument now. You gotta- [Liz takes the phone from Ned.]\
\
Liz: Peter, is that you?\
\
Peter: Oh, hey, Liz.\
\
Karen: Is that Liz?\
\
[Peter jumps from the bus, tumbles on his back, and starts running.]\
\
Peter: Please put Ned back on the phone.\
\
Karen: You should tell her how you feel.\
\
[Peter tries to put a word in edgewise but Liz ignores him and talks on.]\
\
Liz: You freak! You are so lucky we won. You know, I want to be mad, but I\'92m more worried. Like, what is going on with you?\
\
[Now at the Lincoln Memorial, Peter is running towards the Washington Monument.]\
\
Peter: Liz, I have to talk to Ned. It\'92s really important!\
\
Security: Miss, all items on the belt, please.\
\
Peter: Liz, there\'92s something in Ned\'92s backpack! It\'92s really dangerous. Don\'92t let it go through an X-ray.\
\
[Not hanging up, Liz puts Ned\'92s phone through the X-ray machine along with Ned\'92s backpack. Ned walks through the scanner, oblivious, and moves to collect his backpack. The X-ray scanner screen buzzes.]\
\
Peter: Liz? Liz! Damn it.\
\
[Peter keeps running, and the Washington Monument comes into view as he gets closer.]\
\
[Ned puts on his bag. The students enter an elevator.]\
\
Flash: Hey, Mr. Harrington, can I be the one to tell Peter he\'92s expelled?\
\
[Outside the Washington Monument, Peter webs his backpack to a tree.]\
\
[The elevator is steadily climbing upwards. The core in Ned\'92s backpack begins to glow.]\
\
Tour Guide: The Washington Monument is 555 feet, 5 and 1/8 inches tall. Notice how the marble and granite are cut around the stone.\
\
[The energy core erupts with light, breaking glass, and the tip of the monument cracks.]\
\
[Peter arrives at the base of the monument.]\
\
Tourist: Did you hear that?\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. Karen, what\'92s going on up there?\
\
Karen: The Chitauri core has detonated and caused severe structural damage to the elevator.\
\
[The spider suit provides Peter a view inside the monument, and it is shown that several people are gathered inside the elevator.]\
\
Peter: Oh, no.\
\
Michelle: My friends are up there!\
\
Peter: What? Uh... Don\'92t worry, ma\'92am. Everything\'92s gonna be okay. Excuse me, excuse me. Oh, my god, that\'92s tall.\
\
[Peter runs through the crowd, leaps onto the side of the monument, and crawls up.]\
\
[On the elevator, Ned drops his backpack. The small space is filled with smoke.]\
\
Charles: Oh, my god. Look at the ceiling.\
\
[A glowing, red crack cuts across the elevator ceiling.]\
\
Liz: Just stay calm, everyone.\
\
Abe: Oh, we are all going to die here.\
\
[Michelle peers up at Peter. He\'92s climbing on the monument, and has gotten so high that he\'92s merely a dot seen from below.]\
\
Karen: Estimating 10 minutes before catastrophic failure.\
\
[Inside the elevator:]\
\
Charles: We're freakin' screwed.\
\
Tour Guide: Okay guys, I know that was scary, but our safety systems are working.\
\
[Peter is now panting.]\
\
Karen: The safety systems are completely failing.\
\
[The tour guide drones on in order to calm the students.]\
\
Tour Guide: We're very safe in here.\
\
[Outside the Monument:]\
\
Karen: The occupants are in imminent mortal danger.\
\
Peter: I'm going as fast as I can!\
\
[Peter pulls himself up with double strands of web.]\
\
[Park rangers open the doors to the elevator shaft. The tour guide opens a hatch in the ceiling of the car, and looks out.]\
\
[Peter continues climbing.]\
\
[Cindy is pulled out of the elevator.]\
\
Park Ranger: Let's go. Give me your hand.\
\
Karen: You now have 125 seconds until catastrophic failure.\
\
[Peter\'92s hands slip a little.]\
\
Peter: What? Why?\
\
Karen: Unexpected motion has caused the deterioration to escalate.\
\
[The spider suit shows the elevator. The park rangers rescuing the students are making the elevator move.\
\
PETER Peter: How do I get in there?\
\
KAREN Karen: Activating reconnaissance drone.\
\
The emblem on Peter\'92s suit detaches, and the spider-shaped robot flies up, over the monument.]\
\
Peter: Whoa, has that been there the whole time? That\'92s awesome.\
\
Karen: Locating optimal entry point.\
\
[The small drone finds a window.]\
\
Karen: Proceed to southwest window.\
\
Peter: Karen, I'm on my way.\
\
[Peter moves around the monument, and continues climbing. Down below, people have started to gather to see what\'92s happening.]\
\
[Inside, Abe peers down the long elevator shaft.]\
\
[Peter reaches the top of the monument. Pausing, he turns onto his back and clings to the cracked stone.]\
\
Peter: Ah!\
\
[Cautiously, Peter peers over the edge to the ground far below.]\
\
Peter: Okay. Oh, my god. Okay.\
\
[He then takes panicky breaths and sticks to the wall.]\
\
Karen: What's wrong? You've reached the southwest window. Why are you hesitating?\
\
Peter: It\'92s fine. It\'92s just, I've just never been this high before.\
\
[Peter tries to shoo away the seagulls perched on the windowsill. Karen\'92s voice is calm and kind as she informs Peter.]\
\
Karen: You have also not reinstalled your parachute, so a fall from this height would most likely be lethal.\
\
[Peter moves on top of the windowsill and the seagulls fly away.]\
\
Peter: Perfect. Oh, my god.\
\
[Peter kicks the window.]\
\
Peter: Why is it not breaking?\
\
Karen: It's a four-inch ballistic glass. You'll have to create more momentum.\
\
[Peter shoots a web against the monument wall and rappels down the strand until his feet lie flat against the glass. Jumping, he swings against the window. The glass cracks slightly.]\
\
[Police helicopters approach, guns ready. Speakers boom as a police officer speaks out.]\
\
Police: This is D.C. Metro police. Identify yourself.\
\
Peter: My friends are in there! My friends are in there! Stop!\
\
Police: Return to the ground immediately.\
\
[Inside the elevator:]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Okay, who's next?\
\
[Liz grabs Mr. Harrington\'92s shoulder, preparing to climb up.]\
\
Flash: Me, it's my turn!\
\
[Flash shoves Liz to get out first, and doesn\'92t give up the trophy.]\
\
Ned: Flash, seriously? What are you doing?\
\
Flash: Come on.\
\
Cindy: Don't worry about the trophy.\
\
[Flash climbs through the hatch in the ceiling of the elevator, and the car shakes.]\
\
Students: Ah!\
\
[Through the yet unbroken window, Peter is watching the students panic.]\
\
[Peter stands against the window as police helicopters hover around him. An officer is aiming his gun in Peter\'92s direction.]\
\
Police: Stand down! Return to the ground immediately!\
\
[Peter is panting heavily, but he climbs to the top of the monument.]\
\
Police: Return to the ground or we will open fire!\
\
[The police officer follows Peter with the aim of his gun, but Peter disappears from his view to the other side of the monument.]\
\
Police: (to the pilot) Go up, go up!\
\
Peter: I got this.\
\
Flash: Take my trophy!\
\
[The car shakes again under Flash\'92s feet.]\
\
Police: This is your last chance!\
\
Peter: Oh, I'm gonna die.\
\
[Peter jumps toward the closest helicopter and extends his web-wings, gliding over the menacing helicopter blades. He shoots a web at the skid, and swings toward the window.]\
\
Peter: Break!\
\
[The window shatters into pieces as Peter swings in, and the roof of the elevator is ripped off. The elevator starts to fall. Peter slides in toward the elevator shaft.]\
\
Liz/Ned: Ahh!\
\
[Peter shoots a strand of web onto the falling elevator, then braces his feet against the doors to the shaft. Liz, Ned and Mr. Harrington are jostled in the elevator as it is stopped.]\
\
Peter: I did it! Whoa!\
\
[The doors break loose, and Peter falls after the plummeting elevator. It catches on a beam and Peter falls in through the ceiling on his back. The impact breaks off a wheel and the car starts to drop again. Peter shoots a web through the hole in the ceiling, stopping the elevator\'92s descent. Hanging upside down with his feet braced against the ceiling of the elevator, Peter grabs on to the strand of web, and tries to make his voice sound different as he helps his friends calm down.]\
\
Peter: Ahem. Hey, how you doing? Don't worry about it. I got you.\
\
Ned: Yes! Yes!\
\
[Ned swings his fist in joy and relief, making the whole elevator wobble.]\
\
Peter: Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, big guy, quit moving around.\
\
Ned: Sorry, sir. So sorry.\
\
[Outside, a fire truck and an ambulance arrive.]\
\
Park Ranger: Let's go, let's go!\
\
[With his web attached to the ceiling high above, Peter slowly pulls the elevator up the shaft. They reach an upper floor.]\
\
Park Ranger: Okay, okay.\
\
Cindy: Mr. Harrington, go. Ned, come on.\
\
Peter: Alright. This is your stop.\
\
Ned: Come on, Liz.\
\
[The metal elevator ceiling starts to bend under Peter\'92s feet.]\
\
Peter: Go, go, go. Everybody out! Move it, people. Move it, move it!\
\
Liz: Are you sure it\'92s safe?\
\
[Liz reaches out, but before she can hold Mr. Harrington\'92s outstretched hand, the ceiling snaps.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Liz!\
\
[Peter webs Liz as the elevator falls. She dangles by her wrist.]\
\
Peter: You\'92re okay. You\'92re okay.\
\
[Peter pulls her up by the web, then takes her hand.]\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
[His web starts to snap as he helps Liz to safety.]\
\
Students: Oh, my god. Good, good.\
\
Mr. Harrington: Come on up. Come on, you guys, stay back. Come on in. Come on in.\
\
Peter: So, uh, is everyone okay?\
\
[Liz nods.]\
\
Karen: This is your chance, Peter. Kiss her.\
\
[Liz and Peter hold a look. The web snaps, and Peter drops. The students, the teacher, and the park rangers look down the elevator shaft going after Peter as he falls.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Thank you.\
\
[Flash peers down the shaft.]\
\
Flash: Are you really friends with Peter Parker?\
\
[In Vulture\'92s warehouse, Schultz tries out the shocker gauntlet. He can move a whole van with the force of his punch. Mason sits at his work table, clutching his work when the table wobbles.]\
\
Mason: I can finish the next order, but without any new materials from that truck...\
\
Toomes: Ugh, damn it. We still have enough to do the Gargan deal though, right?\
\
Mason: Yeah, but then that's it.\
\
[Perching on the table, Vulture strokes his chin.]\
\
Mason: Oh, maybe it is time that I built the high-altitude seal.\
\
Toomes: Would you shut up about that?\
\
Mason: It's only one job.\
\
Toomes: No.\
\
[Schultz stands nearby.]\
\
Toomes: Eight years, not a word from the Feds, nothing from those Halloween-costume-wearing bozos up there in Stark tower. And then all of a sudden, this little bastard in red tights shows up and he thinks he can tear down everything I've built. Really?\
\
[Vulture shrugs.]\
\
Toomes: I\'92m gonna kill him. I'm gonna find him...\
\
Schultz: I found him.\
\
[On TV, the news shows spider man at the Washington Monument. The headline says \'93Man Spider Climbs Washington Monument.\'94]\
\
News Anchor: Spider-Man swooped in, heroically saving an Academic Decathlon team from Queens. The identity of the masked hero is still unknown.\
\
[Vulture\'92s expression is unreadable as he studies the screen.]\
\
[At night, the students\'92 families meet them by the school bus. Liz\'92s mother hugs Liz.]\
\
Liz: Mom.\
\
Doris: It\'92s okay. Alright.\
\
May: Peter?\
\
[Aunt May runs to Peter and embraces him.]\
\
Families: Come here, come here. Oh, my god.\
\
[At school, the student news plays on a TV in the hall.]\
\
Jason: This past weekend, Midtown's Academic Decathlon team defeated the country's best to win the national championship. Later that day, they also defeated death.\
\
Abe: (yells) Explosion. Sally scream. Flash scream. Everybody screamin\'92.\
\
Charles: (excited) There were purple lasers and smoke everywhere, It was...\
\
[A cat emoji appears over Charles\'92 mouth and a beep is inserted as he swears.]\
\
Charles: ...just like a bon Jovi concert.\
\
Mr. Harrington: As you know, we made it out alive, and that's the important thing. I couldn't bear to lose a student on a school trip. Not again.\
\
[The camera amateurishly zooms in on Mr. Harrington\'92s face.]\
\
Jason: Thankfully, no one was seriously injured, thanks to the Spider-Man.\
\
Jason/Betty: (awkwardly) Thank you, Spider-Man.\
\
Jason: Up next: The Spider-Man mania is sweeping the school. How can you show your spider spirit?\
\
[Peter grins as he walks past the TV showing the student news. A few students are standing around the TV to watch the news. As Peter cheerfully enters another hall, Ned joins him.]\
\
Ned: Dude, dude, dude, dude. What is it like being famous when nobody knows it's you?\
\
Peter: Crazy, dude.\
\
Ned: It\'92s crazy. Should we tell everyone?\
\
Peter: No.\
\
Ned: Should I tell everyone?\
\
Peter: No, dude, no, that\'92s not a good idea.\
\
Ned: Okay, come on, we'll be late to class.\
\
Peter: I\'92m not going to class.\
\
Ned: You\'92re already in so much trouble for ditching the Decathlon.\
\
Peter: Dude, listen, I figured it out, right? The wing suit guy is stealing from Damage Control. And what he takes from Damage Control, that\'92s how he builds the weapons. So all I gotta do is catch him.\
\
Ned: But we have a Spanish quiz.\
\
Peter: Ned, I'm probably never gonna come back here. Mr. Stark is moving the Avengers upstate, so when I bring this guy in-\
\
Ned: Dude, you want to be a high school dropout?\
\
Peter: I am so far beyond high school right now.\
\
Principal Morita: Parker, my office.\
\
[At detention. A video plays, featuring Captain America. He pulls up a chair and sits.]\
\
Steve: So... You got detention. You screwed up.\
\
[Peter sighs and bites his lip in frustration.]\
\
Steve: You know what you did was wrong. The question is, how are you gonna make things right? Maybe you were trying to be cool. But take it from a guy who's been frozen for 65 years, the only way to really be cool is to follow the rules.\
\
[We see the classroom is sparsely filled with students. Michelle is sitting in a seat behind Peter. Peter sighs again and stands up forcefully.]\
\
Steve: We all know what's right. We all know what's wrong. Next time those turkeys try to convince you of something you know is wrong...\
\
[Peter gets up and marches out past Michelle. Coach Wilson is slouching at a desk.]\
\
Coach Wilson: (indifferently) Hey, where you going? Get back here.\
\
Steve: Just think to yourself, what would Captain America do?\
\
Coach Wilson: (to Michelle) Why are you here? You don't even have detention.\
\
Michelle: Oh, I know. I just like coming here to sketch people in crisis.\
\
[Michelle holds up a sketch depicting Coach Wilson.]\
\
Michelle: Heh. It's you.\
\
Steve: So your body's changing. Believe me, I know how that feels.\
\
[In the empty hallway, Peter lifts a row of lockers off the ground, revealing a hidden space beneath. He grabs a bottle of web fluid and lowers the lockers. Peter throws the bottle up in the air, and catches it again.]\
\
[Arriving home, Peter peeks in the front door.]\
\
Peter: May?\
\
[He checks the living room, which looks empty.]\
\
[We are now inside Peter's bedroom. Peter is wearing normal clothes over his suit and lounging in his chair.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Karen. What's up?\
\
Karen: Hey, Peter. How was your Spanish quiz?\
\
Peter: Listen, I was wondering if you could help me. I'm trying to figure out who the guys under the bridge were that night, but I mean, I can only kind of remember part of a license plate.\
\
Karen: I can run facial recognition on the footage of that encounter.\
\
[A string of data appears in front of Peter\'92s eyes.]\
\
Peter: Footage?\
\
Karen: Yes, Peter. I record everything you see.\
\
Peter: Everything?\
\
Karen: Everything.\
\
Peter: Like all the time?\
\
Karen: It's called the Baby Monitor Protocol.\
\
[Peter throws away his pen in irritation.]\
\
Peter: Yeah, of course it is. Um, yeah, just roll it back to last Friday.\
\
Karen: With pleasure.\
\
[Karen shows a footage of Peter fooling around in front of a mirror in his spider suit mask.]\
\
Peter: (on video)Hey, everyone. Yeah, kick-ass party. Hey, what's up, Liz? Peter's told me a lot about you.\
\
[The Peter in the footage winks.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no. No, no, no. This is just me messing around. Go later in the day, later in the day.\
\
[Karen fast-forwards the video.]\
\
Peter: (on video) It is I, Thor, son of Odin!\
\
[Peter is doing impressions of Thor, holding a wooden hammer in his hand.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no, no, no. That's definitely... no. That's definitely not what we wanted to watch. Just...\
\
Karen: Your impressions are very funny.\
\
Peter: Fast-forward to the arms deal.\
\
[Peter stands up. The footage shows three men from the arms deal that Peter was searching for.]\
\
Peter: Okay. The two on the right, who are they?\
\
Karen: Searching law enforcement databases. No records found for two of the individuals.\
\
Peter: Nothing?\
\
Karen: One individual identified. Aaron Davis, age 33. He has a criminal record and an address here in Queens.\
\
[The spider suit displays the criminal record of Aaron Davis.]\
\
Peter: Let's pay him a visit.\
\
Karen: Would you like me to activate the Enhanced Interrogation Protocol?\
\
Peter: Uh, yeah.\
\
[In a parking building, the scruffy man from the weapons deal, Aaron Davis, carries groceries to his car. The spider drone follows him. As Aaron opens the trunk, Peter arrives in his spider man suit. He sticks Aaron\'92s hand to the trunk with a web. Annoyed, Aaron stares at the spider drone.]\
\
Peter: Remember me?\
\
[Peter speaks in a deep metallic voice. He approaches Aaron\'92s car, and Aaron seems taken aback.]\
\
Aaron: Uh, hey...\
\
Peter: I need information. You're gonna give it to me now.\
\
Aaron: All right, chill.\
\
Peter: Come on!\
\
Aaron: What happened to your voice?\
\
Peter: What do you mean, what happened to my voice?\
\
Aaron: I heard you by the bridge. I know what a girl sound like.\
\
Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a boy. I mean, I'm a... I'm a man.\
\
Aaron: I don't care what you are, a boy, a girl...\
\
Peter: I'm not a girl! I'm a man. Come on, man. Look, who is selling these weapons? I need to know. Give me names or else.\
\
[Aaron slams the trunk shut, and Peter startles. He steps back and looks around in surprise. The spider drone chirps and flies around Peter\'92s head.]\
\
Aaron: You ain't ever done this before, huh?\
\
Peter: Deactivate interrogation mode.\
\
[The spider drone goes back in the emblem on the suit\'92s chest. Aaron laughs. Peter\'92s voice changes back to its high-pitched tone.]\
\
Peter: Look, man, these guys are selling weapons that are crazy dangerous. They can't just be out on the streets. Look, if one of them can just cut Delmar's bodega in half...\
\
[Aaron is looking at his fingers, sniffing, not amused. However, when Peter mentions Delmar\'92s, he gains interest.]\
\
Aaron: You know Delmar's?\
\
Peter: Yeah, best sandwich in Queens.\
\
Aaron: Sub Haven's pretty good.\
\
Peter: It's too much bread.\
\
Aaron: I like bread.\
\
Peter: Come on, man, please.\
\
[Peter starts to walk away.]\
\
Peter: Stupid interrogation mode. Karen, don't ever do that again.\
\
Aaron: The other night, you told that dude, "if you shoot somebody, shoot me." It's pretty ballsy. I don't want those weapons in this neighborhood. I got a nephew who live here.\
\
[Peter stops when Aaron starts speaking, and walks back to him.]\
\
Peter: Who are these guys? What can you tell me about the guy with the wings?\
\
Aaron: Other than he's a psychopath dressed like a demon, nothing. I don't know who he is or where he is.\
\
[Peter leans his head on Aaron\'92s car, and gives out a sigh.]\
\
Aaron: I do know where he's gonna be.\
\
Peter: Really?\
\
Aaron: Yeah, this crazy dude I used to work with, he's supposed to be doing a deal with him.\
\
Peter: Yes! Yes. Thank-\
\
[Peter starts to walk happily away, giggling.]\
\
Aaron: Hey. Hey. Hey. I didn't tell you where. You don't have a location.\
\
Peter: Right, of course. Yeah, my bad. Silly. Just...\
\
[Embarrassed, Peter comes closer and leans on the car.]\
\
Peter: Yeah. Where is it?\
\
Aaron: Can I give you some advice?\
\
Peter: Hmm?\
\
Aaron: You got to get better at this part of the job.\
\
Peter: I don't understand. I'm intimidating.\
\
[Peter demonstrates his \'93intimidating\'94 pose, crossing his arms.]\
\
Aaron: Staten Island ferry, eleven.\
\
Peter: Oh, that's soon. Hey, that's gonna dissolve in two hours.\
\
Aaron: No, no, no, no. Come fix this.\
\
Peter: Two hours. You deserve that.\
\
[Peter walks away, stabbing a finger in Aaron\'92s direction.]\
\
Aaron: I got ice cream in here.\
\
Peter: You deserve that. You're a criminal. Bye, Mr. Criminal.\
\
[At the Staten Island Ferry terminal, Peter swings onto a building roof. As the massive orange ferry pulls out of the dock, he takes a running leap and spreads his glider wings. He lands and hangs on the hull.]\
\
Peter: (grunts) Nice.\
\
[He peeks through a window and sees passengers sitting inside.]\
\
Peter: Okay, Karen, activate Enhanced Reconnaissance Mode.\
\
Karen: Sure thing.\
\
Toomes: He\'92s up front. Main deck.\
\
Schultz: I hate this guy.\
\
Peter: It\'92s the guy from the bridge, right? Who\'92s that other guy?\
\
Toomes: Just keep me posted.\
\
Karen: There\'92s no record of him in my criminal database. Incoming call from May Peter. Should I reroute to your heads-up display?\
\
Peter: I can\'92t talk right now. I\'92ll call her back.\
\
[He watches Toomes. The spider drone climbs onto his head.]\
\
Peter: Hey, dronie, keep an eye on that guy. We can\'92t let anybody get away this time.\
\
[The drone hovers by the window. Peter climbs up to the ferry roof. He crawls to the edge and peers down at four men on the front deck.]\
\
Peter: Who\'92s the guy on the left?\
\
Karen: Mac Gargan. Extensive criminal record, including homicide. Would you like me to activate Instant Kill?\
\
Peter: No, Karen, stop it with the Instant Kill already.\
\
[Schultz approaches Gargan.]\
\
Schultz: White pickup truck.\
\
[Gargan nods to a slim man who walks away.]\
\
Peter: Dronie, scan the ship for a white pickup truck.\
\
[The tiny drone scans the cargo under the deck and spots a pickup truck. It hovers over the truck and scans its contents. Toomes\'92 coworker gets out of the car and leads the slim man to the back.]\
\
Peter: Oh, this is too perfect. I got the weapons, buyers, and sellers all in one place.\
\
Karen: Incoming call from Tony Stark.\
\
Peter: No, no, no. No, no, don\'92t answer.\
\
Tony: Mr. Parker. Got a sec?\
\
Peter: Uh, I\'92m actually at school.\
\
Karen: No, you\'92re not.\
\
Tony: Nice work in D.C.\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
Tony: My dad never really gave me a lot of support... And I\'92m just trying to break the cycle of shame.\
\
Peter: Uh, I\'92m kind of in the middle of something right now.\
\
Tony: Don\'92t cut me off when I\'92m complimenting you. Anyway, great things are about to-\
\
[The ferry horn blares.]\
\
Tony: What is that?\
\
Peter: Uh, I\'92m at band practice.\
\
Tony: That\'92s odd. Happy told me you quit band six weeks ago. What\'92s up?\
\
Peter: I gotta go. Uh, end call.\
\
Tony: Hey.\
\
Peter: I\'92ll take those! (snatches a key chain) Yoink!\
\
[He then leaps onto the deck.]\
\
Peter: Hey, guys. The illegal-weapons-deal-ferry was at 10:30. You missed it.\
\
[He disarms two guys with the spiderweb, kicks Gargan, and slams him. Peter ducks from Schultz\'92s Shocker gauntlet, which gets caught in a gate.]\
\
Randy: Spider guy\'92s here.\
\
[Toomes leaves his seat. Two thugs get up behind Peter.]\
\
Peter: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not so fast.\
\
[Peter throws them both.]\
\
Peter: Are you guys okay? My bad. That was a little hard.\
\
[He eyes Schultz, who is still struggling to free himself.]\
\
Peter: I gotta say the other guy was way better with that thing.\
\
[He then reloads his web-shooter.]\
\
Peter: I\'92m honestly, I\'92m, I\'92m shocked.\
\
[Peter shoots a web grenade behind him, attaching a thug to the wall with it. In the cargo hold, Toomes bashes the slim man\'92s head against the truck. He then faces Peter, who is standing yards away on deck. Suddenly, agents come out of nowhere and aim at Peter.]\
\
FBI Agent 1: Freeze! FBI!\
\
FBI Agent 2: Don\'92t move.\
\
FBI Agent 1: Get on the ground.\
\
FBI Agent 1: FBI.\
\
Peter: Wait, what do you mean, FBI?\
\
Karen: The FBI is the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\
\
Peter: I know what the FBI means, but what are they doing here?\
\
[A mechanical wing bursts out of the truck, making the agents turn to it. Toomes flies toward the deck in his vulture suit. Agents shoot at him.]\
\
Peter: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!\
\
[Vulture fires a high tech weapon, drags a car, and throws it to the agents.]\
\
Peter: Look out, look out, look out. Move, move, move!\
\
[Vulture hits Peter, causing him to fall into the water. He then fires energy blasts at a man\'92s arm.]\
\
Toomes: Get to the top deck. We\'92re getting out of here.\
\
[Peter shoots his web at Schultz, but misses. He shoots the web at Vulture\'92s leg and pulls. Vulture hides behind his large metal wings that protects him from the gunfire, then shoots at the agents. One blast hits an indoor seating area. Peter weighs Vulture with a car attached to his web. Dodging a blast, he leaps to the upper deck and shoots some more web. Hanging from Vulture\'92s suit, Peter swings over the water. The flying man fires at Peter. He swings back onto the deck. Vulture cuts the strands of web with the blades of his wings. Peter shoots web at the barrel of Vulture\'92s high tech weapon.]\
\
Peter: Activate Taser Web!\
\
[Electricity travels up the strand of web and the weapon is yanked away from Vulture. On the deck, it bounces around wildly. Peter traps the weapon using lots of spiderweb.]\
\
Toomes: You\'92re messing with things you don\'92t understand.\
\
[The weapon\'92s laser beam breaks up into multiple rays. The energy blast cuts through the upper seating area, narrowly missing frightened passengers. In the air, Vulture dodges the blasts as they shoot into the sky. Schultz sprints toward an upper deck, leaps into the air, and lands on Vulture\'92s back. The rays slice through the length of the ferry, then vanish. In the seating area, passengers move cautiously. In the cargo bay, jets of water start to split up the ferry.]\
\
Peter: Oh, my god. What do I do? Karen, uh, give me an X-ray of the boat and target all the strongest points.\
\
[Peter\'92s display highlights spots on the structure.]\
\
Peter: Web grenade. Web grenade.\
\
[Shooting web, he leaps between the two sides of the ship.]\
\
Peter: Splitter web, go.\
\
[Peter tumbles back and forth on the upper part of the ferry, connecting the ship with strands of web. He dodges flames as he travels down the length of the ferry. Peter fires several strands of web and once, and binds them together with another strand. Reaching the bow, he crouches on the edge of the roof. He eyes the two leaning halves of the ferry that are crisscrossed with spiderweb.]\
\
Karen: Great job, Peter. You are 98 percent successful.\
\
Peter: Ninety-eight?\
\
Man: Yeah, Spider-Man!\
\
[The web strands begin to snap.]\
\
Peter: No, no, no, no!\
\
[Water floods the cargo hold, pushing the cars forward. People cling to posts as the stream rushes past them. On the upper level, passengers slide down the floor of the leaning ferry. The gap widens as the web strands continue to snap. Peter leaps into the air.]\
\
Peter: No!\
\
[He grabs a thread and shoots another. Arms outstretched, Peter hangs between the two sides, trying to hold them together.]\
\
[Suddenly, the two sides start to move toward each other.]\
\
Peter: What the hell?\
\
[Peter lands gently in the seating area and looks around.]\
\
Peter: What the hell...\
\
[Iron Man rises into view.]\
\
Tony: Hi, Spider-Man. Band practice, was it?\
\
[Hovering outside, he holds up one half of the boat. Drones arrive and attach themselves to the other half. Thrusters propel the two halves of the ferry forward and join them together.]\
\
[Iron Man looks at Peter through the window, then flies off.]\
\
Man: Yeah, Iron Man!\
\
[Peter swings into the cargo hold, where Iron Man is welding the ferry back together.]\
\
Peter: Uh, Mr. Stark? Hey, Mr. Stark. Could I do anything? What do you want me to do?\
\
Tony: I think you\'92ve done enough.\
\
[Iron Man flies away. Peter climbs to the top platform of a mast and looks around. Smoke is pouring out from the massive vessel. Rescue boats and helicopters approach from all directions.]\
\
[Schultz is walking toward Vulture in the warehouse when he speaks out:]\
\
Toomes: So that\'92s it, you\'92re just gonna run?\
\
Schultz: Feds were waiting for us. Now we\'92re on Iron Man\'92s radar? Yeah, I\'92m running. You should, too.\
\
Toomes: You know I can\'92t do that.\
\
Schultz: So now what?\
\
Toomes: Mason, can you get that high-altitude seal thing up and running in time?\
\
Mason: Seriously? Yes. You will not regret this.\
\
Toomes: (to Schultz) You in?\
\
[Schultz smiles faintly and lifts his eyebrows.]\
\
[Helicopters are still flying around the ferry. Peter is perching on the edge of a building, sans mask, when Iron Man flies over to him.]\
\
Tony: Previously on Peter Screws the Pooch: I tell you to stay away from this. Instead, you hacked a multimillion-dollar suit so you could sneak around behind my back doing the one thing I told you not to do.\
\
Peter: Is everyone okay?\
\
Tony: No thanks to you.\
\
Peter: No thanks to me?\
\
[Angered, Peter jumps off the edge and approaches Tony.]\
\
Peter: Those weapons were out there, and I tried to tell you about it. But you didn\'92t listen. None of this would\'92ve happened if you had just listened to me. If you even cared, you\'92d actually be here.\
\
[The Iron Man suit opens, revealing Tony inside. He steps down from the suit and marches toward Peter, who backs off.]\
\
Tony: I did listen, kid. Who do you think called the FBI, huh? Do you know that I was the only one who believed in you? Everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a 14-year-old kid.\
\
Peter: I\'92m fifteen.\
\
Tony: No, this is where you zip it, all right? The adult is talking. What if somebody had died tonight? Different story, right? \'91Cause that\'92s on you. And if you died, I feel like that\'92s on me. I don\'92t need that on my conscience.\
\
Peter: Yes, sir.\
\
Tony: Yes.\
\
Peter: I, I\'92m sorry.\
\
Tony: Sorry doesn\'92t cut it.\
\
Peter: I understand. I just wanted to be like you.\
\
Tony: And I wanted you to be better. Okay, it\'92s not working out. I\'92m gonna need the suit back.\
\
Peter: For how long?\
\
Tony: Forever.\
\
[Peter shakes his head with a shocked expression.]\
\
Tony: Yeah. Yeah, that\'92s how it works.\
\
Peter: No, no, no... Please, please, please...\
\
Tony: Let\'92s have it.\
\
Peter: You don\'92t understand. Please. This is all I have. I\'92m nothing without this suit.\
\
Tony: If you\'92re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\'92t have it. Okay? God, I sound like my dad.\
\
Peter: I don\'92t have any other clothes.\
\
Tony: Okay, we\'92ll sort that out.\
\
[Peter walks down the hallway of his apartment wearing pink Hello Kitty pajamas and an oversized NYC tourist T-shirt. He knocks on a door, which May answers.]\
\
Peter: (whispers) Hey.\
\
[May inhales deeply and storms inside.]\
\
May: I\'92ve been calling you all day. You didn\'92t answer your phone. You can\'92t do that. Then this ferry thing happens. I\'92ve called five police stations.\
\
[Peter walks to May and stands behind her.]\
\
May: Five. I called five of your friends.\
\
Peter: I\'92m fine.\
\
May: I called Ned\'92s mother.\
\
Peter: May, I\'92m okay. Honestly. Just relax. I\'92m fine.\
\
[May stands and faces Peter.]\
\
May: You. Cut the bullshit. I know you left detention. I know you left the hotel room in Washington. I know you sneak out of this house every night. That\'92s not fine. Peter, you have to tell me what\'92s going on. Just lay it out. It\'92s just me and you.\
\
[A beat, then Peter\'92s eyes fill up with tears.]\
\
Peter: I lost the Stark internship.\
\
May: What?\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
May: What happened?\
\
Peter: I just thought that I could work really hard and he could, he would, you know. But I screwed it up.\
\
[Peter sits down on the sofa next to him. May hugs him and strokes him.]\
\
May: Oh... It\'92s okay, it\'92s okay. It\'92s okay.\
\
Peter: I\'92m sorry I made you worry.\
\
May: You know I\'92m not trying to ruin your life.\
\
Peter: Yeah, I know.\
\
May: Just... I used to sneak out too.\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
[May scowls, then leans in to sniff Peter\'92s hair.]\
\
May: And take a shower. You smell. You smell like garbage.\
\
Peter: I know.\
\
[Through a window, we see Peter facing Principal Morita.]\
\
Principal Morita: Peter, you\'92re a good kid and you\'92re a smart kid. So just try to keep your head straight, okay?\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
Principal Morita: All right. Get out of here.\
\
[Peter takes his bag, exits the principal\'92s office. Ned is waiting for him in the hallway.]\
\
Ned: Are you expelled? Do you have to go to that high school on 46th where the principal has a crossbow?\
\
Peter: Pretty sure that\'92s an urban myth, and no, I\'92m not expelled.\
\
Ned: You\'92re so lucky.\
\
[They walk down the corridor. Tilt up to find a homecoming banner hanging from the ceiling.]\
\
[Peter is resting his head on the desk at detention. He turns to find Michelle holding up a sketch of him with a sad expression.]\
\
[We are now in Spanish class. The clock is ticking. A hand holding a blue pen shoots into frame. It\'92s Peter.]\
\
Peter: Me gusta hacer la tarea. (I like doing homework.)\
\
Spanish Teacher: Muy bueno, se\'f1or Parker. (Very good, Mr. Parker.)\
\
[Peter and Ned finish building the Lego Death Star in the orchestra practice room. Ned hands Peter the Palpatine figure, which Peter places on the top. They do a secret handshake.]\
\
[School bell rings. Peter walks out into an empty hallway and sees Liz.]\
\
Peter: Hey.\
\
Liz: Hey.\
\
Peter: I thought you had calculus fifth period.\
\
Liz: Yeah, I was just doing some homecoming stuff.\
\
[Peter approaches Liz.]\
\
Peter: Hey, look, I, uh... I just wanted to apologize about the whole Decathlon thing. I really-\
\
Liz: It\'92s fine. Last week, Decathlon was the most important thing, but then I almost died.\
\
Peter: No, I, I just mean that... it was not cool, especially... (sighs) ...because... I like you.\
\
Liz: I know.\
\
[Peter stares at her, shocked.]\
\
Peter: You do?\
\
Liz: You\'92re terrible at keeping secrets.\
\
Peter: (smiles) Yeah, you\'92d be surprised.\
\
[An awkward moment. They look at each other.]\
\
Peter: I got to get to class, but, um, I\'92d say we should hang out, but I\'92m gonna be in detention for...\
\
Liz: Uh-huh.\
\
Peter: ...ever, but, um, I guess you already have a date to homecoming.\
\
Liz: Actually, I was so busy planning it I never really got around to that part, so...\
\
[Liz shakes her head.]\
\
Peter: Uh, do you want to go with me?\
\
Liz: (smiles) Yeah. Sure.\
\
Peter: Really? I mean, uh, great. Cool.\
\
Liz: Cool.\
\
Peter: I\'92m actually going that way.\
\
[Carrying the hall pass, Peter walks past Liz. We see her turning to watch him go in the background. A huge grin breaks across Peter\'92s face.]\
\
[In his apartment, Peter slides into the kitchen with a frenzied look.]\
\
Peter: May, I need your help.\
\
[May stares at him with a surprised expression. Peter picks out a dress shirt and tie, polishes his shoes, shakes his head in front of a mirror. May prepares a pink ribbon corsage for him. Peter sprays a perfume in the air to test it, then grimaces at the scent. May and Peter watch a YouTube video on how to tie a Windsor knot. Peter turns to May with a surprisingly passable Windsor knot; overlooking his lopsided shirt collar, that is.]\
\
May: Right?\
\
[Peter is now fully dressed in a suit. May teaches him how to dance, then straightens his clothes.]\
\
[May\'92s car comes to a stop in front of Liz\'92s house.]\
\
May: It\'92s game day. So, what\'92s the plan?\
\
Peter: Open the door for her.\
\
May: Mm-hmm.\
\
Peter: Tell her she looks nice, but not too much because that\'92s creepy.\
\
May: Don\'92t be creepy.\
\
Peter: No. And, uh, when I dance with her, I\'92m putting my hands on her hips. I got this.\
\
[Peter gets out of the car and leans into the car window.]\
\
Peter: Love you.\
\
May: Bye.\
\
[Peter walks up to the front door, pink corsage in hand, then rings the doorbell. He waits with a nervous look for the door to open. With Toomes on the other side. Peter\'92s smile fades and he freezes. Toomes grins at him.]\
\
Toomes: You must be Peter.\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Toomes: I\'92m Liz\'92s dad. Put her there.\
\
[They shake hands.]\
\
Toomes: Hell of a grip. Come on in here. Come on.\
\
[Toomes drags Peter inside and closes the door. Peter follows Toomes towards the kitchen. Suddenly:]\
\
Doris: Hi, Peter. You look very handsome.\
\
Peter: Thank you.\
\
Doris: (whispers) You got his name right?\
\
Toomes: Freddie?\
\
Doris: Peter.\
\
Toomes: Peter, Peter.\
\
[Doris chuckles and shakes her head.]\
\
Doris: I\'92m gonna go get Liz.\
\
Peter: Okay.\
\
[She walks out, leaving Peter with Toomes. Toomes starts to polish knives.]\
\
Toomes: You all right, Pete?\
\
Peter: Yeah.\
\
Toomes: Because you look pale. You want something to drink? Like a bourbon or a scotch, or something like that?\
\
Peter: I\'92m not old enough to drink.\
\
Toomes: That\'92s the right answer.\
\
[Toomes\'92 eyes widen as he sees his daughter dressed in a beautiful red dress.]\
\
Toomes: Wow.\
\
[Peter turns in order to see Liz.]\
\
Toomes: Wow, wow, wow. Do you look beautiful.\
\
Liz: Please don\'92t embarrass me, Dad.\
\
Toomes: Doesn\'92t she, Pete?\
\
[Liz moves to stand next to Peter.]\
\
Peter: Yeah, you look really good.\
\
Toomes: Once again, that\'92s the right answer.\
\
Liz: Is that a corsage?\
\
[Staring at Toomes, Peter abruptly hands the corsage to Liz.]\
\
Liz: Thanks.\
\
Toomes: Well, hey, I\'92m your chauffeur, so, uh, let\'92s get this show on the road.\
\
Doris: No, no, no, no, we have to take some pictures, babe. All right. Oh, right here. Perfect.\
\
Liz: Mom.\
\
Doris: Okay. Come on, you guys. Peter, closer.\
\
[Peter stands beside Liz.]\
\
Doris: Smile. There you go.\
\
[Liz\'92s mother takes some more snaps. Peter puts on a tense grin for the photo, his eyes still glued on Toomes.]\
\
Peter: Sir, you don\'92t have to drive us.\
\
Toomes: No, no, it\'92s not a big deal. I\'92m going out of town. It\'92s right on my way.\
\
[Liz goes to her mother to check the photos.]\
\
Doris: He\'92s always coming and going.\
\
Toomes: Last time.\
\
Doris: Have fun.\
\
[Doris hugs her daughter.]\
\
Liz: Thank you.\
\
Toomes: Promise.\
\
Doris: (whispers) He\'92s cute.\
\
Liz: Shh.\
\
Toomes: See you in a couple of days.\
\
Doris: Bye, baby.\
\
Toomes: All right.\
\
[Doris and Adrian Toomes kiss each other.]\
\
Toomes: Come on, Pedro.\
\
Doris: Bye, Peter. Have fun.\
\
Peter: Yeah, I will.\
\
[Toomes is driving. Liz looks at herself through her phone camera, wearing the corsage Peter gave her, while Peter stares out the window.]\
\
Toomes: What are you gonna do, Pete?\
\
Peter: What?\
\
Toomes: When you graduate, what do you think you\'92re gonna do?\
\
Peter: Oh, um, I don\'92t know.\
\
Liz: Don\'92t grill him, Dad.\
\
Toomes: Just saying, you know. All you guys who go to that school, you pretty much have your life planned out, right?\
\
Peter: Yeah, no, I\'92m just a sophomore.\
\
Liz: Peter has an internship with Tony Stark. So I think he doesn\'92t have to worry.\
\
Toomes: Really?\
\
Liz: Mm-hmm.\
\
Toomes: Stark?\
\
Liz: So cool.\
\
Toomes: What do you do?\
\
Peter: Yeah, actually, I don\'92t intern for him anymore.\
\
[Liz turns to Peter, frowning.]\
\
Liz: Seriously?\
\
Peter: Yeah, it got, um... boring.\
\
Liz: It was boring? You got to hang out with Spider-Man.\
\
Toomes: Really? Spider-Man? Wow. What\'92s he like?\
\
Peter: Yeah, he\'92s nice. Nice man. Solid dude.\
\
Toomes: Hmm.\
\
[Liz shows Peter her phone.]\
\
Liz: Look, so cute.\
\
Peter: Aww...\
\
[Toomes keeps stealing glances at Peter.]\
\
Toomes: I\'92ve seen you around, right? I mean... Somewhere. We\'92ve, uh, have we ever? Because even the voice...\
\
Liz: Um, he does Academic Decathlon with me.\
\
Toomes: Oh.\
\
Liz: And he was at my party.\
\
Toomes: Ah.\
\
Peter: It was a great party, really great, yeah. Beautiful house, a lot of windows.\
\
[Peter and Liz smile at each other.]\
\
Liz: You were there for, like, two seconds.\
\
Peter: That was... I was there longer than two seconds.\
\
Liz: You disappeared.\
\
Peter: No, no. I did not disappear.\
\
Liz: Yes, you did. You disappeared like you always do. Like you did in D.C., too.\
\
[Toomes glances at Peter suspiciously. He stops at an intersection.]\
\
Toomes: That\'92s terrible, what happened down there in D.C., though. Were you scared?\
\
[Peter nods tersely.]\
\
Toomes: I\'92ll bet you were glad when your old pal Spider-Man showed up in the elevator, though, huh?\
\
[Peter glances at Liz, then:]\
\
Peter: Yeah, well, I actually didn\'92t go up. I saw it all from the ground.\
\
Liz: Yeah.\
\
[Toomes stares at Peter through the rearview mirror.]\
\
Peter: Very lucky that he was there that day.\
\
Toomes: (grins) Good old Spider-Man.\
\
[The traffic light turns green. Car honks blare behind them.]\
\
Liz: Dad, the light.\
\
[Toomes continues driving and arrives at Midtown High. Outside, well-dressed teenagers are walking to the entrance decorated with colorful balloons.]\
\
Toomes: Here we are. End of the line.\
\
Liz: Thanks, Dad.\
\
Toomes: You head in there, gumdrop. I\'92m gonna give Peter the, uh, the \'93dad talk.\'94\
\
Liz: (to Peter) Don\'92t let him intimidate you.\
\
[Liz kisses her dad on the cheek.]\
\
Liz: Love you.\
\
Toomes: Love you, gumdrop.\
\
Liz: Have a safe flight.\
\
[Liz gets out of the car and joins her friends.]\
\
Liz: Hi! You guys look so pretty.\
\
[Toomes turns to Peter with a gun.]\
\
Toomes: Does she know?\
\
Peter: Know what?\
\
Toomes: So she doesn\'92t. Good. Close to the vest. I admire that. I\'92ve got a few secrets of my own. Of all the reasons I didn\'92t want my daughter to date...\
\
[Toomes cracks a grin and shrugs, but Peter does not say anything.]\
\
Toomes: Peter, nothing is more important than family. You saved my daughter\'92s life. I could never forget something like that. So I\'92m gonna give you one chance. Are you ready? You walk through those doors, you forget any of this happened. And don\'92t you ever, ever interfere with my business again. Because if you do, I\'92ll kill you and everybody you love. I\'92ll kill you dead. That\'92s what I\'92ll do to protect my family. Do you understand?\
\
[Peter nods, unable to meet Toomes\'92 eyes.]\
\
Toomes: Hey. I just saved your life. Now, what do you say?\
\
[Peter raises his head and looks straight at Toomes.]\
\
Peter: Thank you.\
\
Toomes: You\'92re welcome. Now, you go in there and you show my daughter a good time, okay? Just not too good.\
\
[Peter gets out of the car with a tense expression on his face. Toomes drives off. Peter enters the school.]\
\
[Peter walks down the hallway, all sounds muffled as if underwater. He stops and watches his friends through the glass doors. Party in full swing. Spotting him, Ned waves and Michelle gives Peter the finger. A beat, then Peter pulls open the door. Pop music and chattering instantly fills Peter\'92s ears. Liz is dancing with some of her friends. She turns to Peter when he approaches.]\
\
Liz: Hey. What did he say to you?\
\
[Peter just stares at Liz with an anxious look. Liz realizes that something is off.]\
\
Peter: Gotta go. I\'92m, I\'92m sorry. You don\'92t deserve this.\
\
[Peter hurries away, leaving Liz in the middle of the dance floor. Michelle watches him go, craning her neck.]\
\
[Peter rushes out through the hallway and unties his tie. He lifts a row of lockers with one hand, picks up his homemade Spider-Man suit from under it.]\
\
[Now clad in his homemade Spider-Man suit, Peter exits the school. As he is about to round a school bus, someone shocks him from behind.]\
\
Schultz: He gave you a choice. You chose wrong.\
\
Peter: Ah, what the hell?\
\
Schultz: What\'92s with the crappy costume?\
\
[The Shocker prepares his gauntlet for another shot. Peter searches for his web-shooter, which has fallen from the impact and is lying on the ground.]\
\
Peter: My web-shooters...\
\
[Peter runs to the web-shooter, but Schultz hits a school bus to attack Peter, then kicks the web-shooter away.]\
\
Schultz: I wasn\'92t sure about this thing at first, but damn.\
\
[Schultz hits Peter with the weapon, throwing him inside the bus. Peter spots chewed gums under a seat.]\
\
Peter: Ugh. Gross.\
\
[Schultz punches the bus into the air. Peter tumbles as the vehicle lands upside down on the ground. Opening the door, Peter falls out. He slowly crawls to his web-shooter.]\
\
Peter: Why did he send you here?\
\
Schultz: Guess you\'92ll never know.\
\
[Suddenly, a strand of web attaches itself to the Shocker gauntlet. Reveal Ned holding the web-shooter.]\
\
Peter: Nice shot!\
\
[Peter pulls the web-shooter to himself and traps Schultz against the school bus with a web blast.]\
\
Peter: Yes! Ned, the guy with the wings is Liz\'92s dad.\
\
Ned: What?\
\
Peter: I know. I gotta tell Mr. Stark. Call Happy Hogan. He\'92s Mr. Stark\'92s head of security. And, uh, get a computer to track my phone for me.\
\
Ned: Are you gonna be okay?\
\
[Peter jumps up onto a streetlight.]\
\
Peter: Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town.\
\
[Ned hurries toward the school building as Peter swings away.]\
\
[Flash is driving his annoyed date to the homecoming dance.]\
\
Flash: I\'92m sorry about dinner, but I know when branzino\'92s fresh, and that was not fresh, okay? So...\
\
[Flash screams as Peter lands on the bonnet of his car.]\
\
Peter: (in a gravelly voice) Flash, I need your car and your phone.\
\
Flash: Uh, sir, technically, this is my dad\'92s car, sir. So I can\'92t...\
\
[Flash watches the Spider-Man drive away in his car and hit a row of bikes. He whimpers.]\
\
[Peter makes a call to Ned while driving precariously. Ned takes it in the library, between rows of computers.]\
\
Peter: (in a normal voice) Hello, Ned? Hey, hey, hey, hey, can you hear me?\
\
Ned: Go for Ned.\
\
Peter: Ned, I need you to track my phone for me.\
\
Ned: Yeah, but where is it?\
\
[Peter's phone lights up in the backseat of Toomes\'92 car. Toomes is unaware. Ned tracks the signal.]\
\
Ned: Genius move. Okay, he just passed the GameStop on Jackson Avenue.\
\
Peter: Hey, where are the headlights on this thing? I\'92m in Flash\'92s car.\
\
[Ned rolls his chair to another computer.]\
\
Ned: I\'92ll pull the specs.\
\
Peter: Okay, you\'92re on speakerphone.\
\
Ned: You stole Flash\'92s car. Awesome.\
\
Peter: Yeah, it\'92s awesome. It\'92s awe... Whoa!\
\
[Peter nearly crashes into other cars.]\
\
Peter: Get out of the way, get out of the way! Move! Move!\
\
Ned: Peter, are you okay?\
\
Peter: I\'92ve never really driven before. Only with May in parking lots. This is a huge step up...\
\
[A car nearly hits Peter, who screams.]\
\
Peter: Hey, have you gotten through to Happy yet?\
\
Ned: Yeah. I\'92m working on it. I just gotta backdoor the phone system.\
\
[Ned rapidly types, then twirls in his chair.]\
\
Ned: Guy in the chair.\
\
[Toomes checks his watch and heads to an old Brooklyn factory warehouse.]\
\
[Happy pops up on Ned\'92s computer screen.]\
\
Happy: Takeoff in nine minutes. (to Ned) Hello? Hello? Who is this?\
\
Ned: Uh... Mr. Happy, it\'92s Ned.\
\
Happy: Who?\
\
Ned: I\'92m an associate of Peter Parker. Got something very important to tell you-\
\
Happy: You gotta be shitting me.\
\
[Happy\'92s screen goes off.]\
\
Ned: Damn.\
\
Peter: Hey, Ned, how we coming on with those headlights?\
\
Ned: Uh... Round knob to the left of the steering wheel, turn clockwise.\
\
Peter: Left. Okay. Okay, perfect. So where\'92s my phone now?\
\
Ned: Um... He stopped in an old industrial park in Brooklyn.\
\
Peter: What? That makes no sense. I thought he said he was going out of town!\
\
[The car is a literal hazard as it drives down the road.]\
\
Ned: Weird. Oh, I reached Mr. Happy. Don\'92t think he likes you, by the way. It sounded like he was catching a flight. He said something about taking off in nine minutes.\
\
Peter: What?\
\
Ned: He was surrounded by a bunch of boxes.\
\
Peter: Boxes? It\'92s moving day. It\'92s moving day! It\'92s moving day! He\'92s gonna rob that plane! I gotta stop him!\
\
[Inside Avengers Tower, Happy is talking on the phone, checking Tony\'92s belongings.]\
\
Happy: All right, wheels up in eight minutes. We just got to load Tony\'92s old Hulkbuster armor, prototype for Cap\'92s new shield, and the Meging... the Meg... the... Thor\'92s magic belt.\
\
[Peter drives down an empty road at a high speed.]\
\
Ned: Okay, slow down. You\'92re getting close. It\'92s on your right.\
\
Peter: What?\
\
Ned: Turn right! Turn right!\
\
[Peter shoots his web to make a sharp turn. The car crashes into a streetlight and is almost overturned. It slides down the road on its side, then finally screeches to a stop.]\
\
Ned: Peter, are you okay?\
\
Peter: Yeah. Just keep trying to get through to Happy.\
\
[Peter jumps out of the car.]\
\
Ned: It\'92s been an honor, Spider-Man.\
\
[Suddenly, the lights come on. Reveal Ms. Warren standing behind Ned.]\
\
Ms. Warren: What are you doing here? There\'92s a dance.\
\
Ned: Uh...\
\
[Ned hurriedly closes his laptop.]\
\
Ned: (awkwardly) I\'92m... looking... at... porn.\
\
[We see a small window in the ceiling open. Peter hangs from his web and slowly descends into the building. The room is filled with computers and gadgets. Monitors showing Avengers Tower and the blueprint of Stark\'92s plane. Peter spots Vulture\'92s wing suit and goes deeper inside.]\
\
Peter: Hey! Surprised?\
\
Toomes: Oh, hey, Pete. I didn\'92t hear you come in.\
\
Peter: It\'92s over. I\'92ve got you.\
\
Toomes: You know, I gotta tell you, Pete, I really, really admire your grit. I see why Liz likes you. I do. When you first came to the house, I wasn\'92t sure. I thought, \'93Really?\'94 But I get it now.\
\
Peter: How could you do this to her?\
\
Toomes: To her? I\'92m not doing anything to her, Pete. I\'92m doing this for her.\
\
Peter: Huh, yeah.\
\
[Peter shoots his web and glues Vulture\'92s left hand against the desk.]\
\
Toomes: (sighs) Peter, you\'92re young. You don\'92t understand how the world works.\
\
Peter: Yeah, but I understand that selling weapons to criminals is wrong.\
\
Toomes: How do you think your buddy Stark paid for that tower? Or any of his little toys? Those people, Pete, those people up there, the rich and the powerful, they do whatever they want. Guys like us, like you and me, they don\'92t care about us. We build their roads and we fight all their wars and everything, but they don\'92t care about us. We have to pick up after \'91em. We have to eat their table scraps. That\'92s how it is. I know you know what I\'92m talking about, Peter.\
\
Peter: Why are you telling me this?\
\
Toomes: Because I want you to understand. And... I needed a little time to get her airborne.\
\
[Vulture takes a folding knife out of his pocket. Vulture\'92s wing suit flies out from behind Peter\'92s back, which he avoids. In the confusion of the moment, Vulture cuts free from the web. The wing suit continues to attack Peter, but he avoids it with quick movements.]\
\
Toomes: I\'92m sorry, Peter.\
\
Peter: What are you talking about? That thing hasn\'92t even touched me yet.\
\
Toomes: True. Then again, wasn\'92t really trying to.\
\
[Peter realizes that the wing suit wasn\'92t attacking him; instead, it was chopping down the pillars. The building collapses, its wreckage raining down on Peter and burying him. Vulture picks up a walkie-talkie.]\
\
Mason: Chief, they\'92re powering up engines.\
\
Toomes: Okay.\
\
Mason: Come on, come on, come on.\
\
Toomes: Yeah, yeah.\
\
[Vulture takes one last look of the pile of debris covering Peter, then walks away. He pauses to stare at the Avengers Tower. His wing suit attaches itself on his back.]\
\
[The plane is about to take off from the Avengers Tower. Happy walks away from it.]\
\
[We hear grunts and cries. Reveal Peter under the debris, still alive. He panics and takes off his mask.]\
\
Peter: Oh, god. Okay, ready?\
\
[He struggles to get up but fails.]\
\
Peter: Hello! Hello! Please. Hey, hey, please. I\'92m down here. I\'92m down here. I\'92m stuck. I\'92m stuck. I can\'92t move. I can\'92t...\
\
[Peter takes a moment to catch his breath and looks down at his reflection on a puddle. The Spider-Man mask in the puddle covers half the reflection, making it look as if Peter is wearing the Spider-Man mask on half his face.]\
\
Tony: If you\'92re nothing without this suit, then you shouldn\'92t have it.\
\
[Once again, Peter tries to push the debris off his back.]\
\
Peter: Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man!\
\
[Peter finally frees himself from the debris and gets up amongst rubbles. He spots Vulture perching on top of a stripped billboard.]\
\
[The plane takes off from Avengers Tower.]\
\
[Mason is sitting in a control room.]\
\
Mason: Launch for intercept. Green light. Green light.\
\
Toomes: Oh, yeah.\
\
[Vulture spreads his wings and prepares for takeoff. Peter shoots his web and swings onto the billboard, but narrowly misses Vulture, who flies away. Spider-Man shoots his web directly at Vulture.]\
\
Tech: Retro-reflective panels engaged.\
\
[The outer panels of the plane light up and mirror the New York City. Vulture goes after the plane.]\
\
Toomes: Got a visual on the plane, feeling a little resistance.\
\
Mason: It\'92s probably just a drag on the new turbines.\
\
[Vulture checks behind him but misses Spider-Man, who is hanging from a web attached to his back.]\
\
Peter: Ah! Whoa!\
\
[As Vulture goes higher and higher up, the night view of New York City gets smaller and smaller under Peter\'92s feet.]\
\
Mason: Look out for the cloaking cameras. Stay in the blind spots.\
\
[Vulture flies to the bottom of the plane and holds on. Peter bumps into the plane a few times, but manages to grab onto it.]\
\
Peter: Oh, my god! Oh, my god!\
\
Mason: Deploy high-altitude vacuum seal.\
\
Toomes: This better work, Mason.\
\
[The wing suit wraps around Vulture like a shell.]\
\
Mason: Trust me, boss. Even one of those boxes and we are set for life.\
\
Toomes: Yeah.\
\
[Vulture puts the matter phase shifter on the plane, creating a small rectangular window, and moves inside. Peter tries to follow Vulture, but loses his grip and almost falls off the plane.]\
\
Peter: Hey! Ah! Whew.\
\
Mason: You have thirty seconds to get to the cockpit and override their security.\
\
[Vulture walks to the front and rips out the door. The cockpit is empty. Outside, we see a blown-up image of Spider-Man crawling down the plane. He must have been caught the cloaking cameras. He approaches the wing suit and tries to open it. Vulture connects a device to the plane.]\
\
Toomes: Cloning transponder signal.\
\
Mason: Launching decoy drone.\
\
[A small drone is launched out from the wing suit, startling Peter.]\
\
Toomes: Entering new coordinates.\
\
[Vulture manipulates the cockpit dashboard, piloting the plane off track.]\
\
[A computer monitor displays the flight course in Avengers Tower.]\
\
Happy: Good, so it\'92s on its way?\
\
Tech: Yes, sir, right on course.\
\
Happy: Okay, thank you. All right.\
\
[The tech takes the laptop and leaves the almost-empty room.]\
\
[Peter is still struggling to open the wing suit. Inside the plane, Vulture finds the boxes and takes off his mask.]\
\
Toomes: Hot dog.\
\
[Vulture opens one box after another. Rows and rows of Chitauri guns, arc reactors, etc. He takes out an Iron Man mask and throws it on the floor. Peter kicks Vulture\'92s wing suit and pushes it aside a bit. The air pressure inside the cabin drops, activating the alarm. Vulture checks an external monitor and realizes that Peter has followed him. He growls in anger.]\
\
[Vulture comes out and puts on his wing suit. Peter tries to hang onto the airplane.]\
\
Peter: Just a typical homecoming on the outside of an invisible jet... Fighting my girlfriend\'92s dad.\
\
[Vulture comes at him and takes out panels right above his head. Peter shoots his web at Vulture. Peter is now suspended in air, one hand holding onto the web sticking to the plane, another hand holding onto the web glued to Vulture. The webs snap off and Peter is sucked in towards the engines.]\
\
Peter: Oh, god!\
\
[He shoots his web to stop the propellers. Vulture, who was also dragged to the engines, escapes death, but his wing suit is a bit damaged. Hanging onto propeller blades laced with spiderweb, Peter sighs in relief.]\
\
Peter: Whew. I can\'92t believe that worked.\
\
[Suddenly, the propeller falls off. Peter avoids the crisis by holding onto the plane and kicking the propeller off his body. Vulture flies back and attacks Peter. Peter avoids them, but Vulture keeps coming at him. The impact sets one of the engines on fire. Peter clings onto the side of the engine with a thin strand of web.]\
\
Mason: Chief, chief, they\'92re losing altitude. Get out of there.\
\
Toomes: I\'92m not going home empty-handed.\
\
[Vulture sets to break open the ceiling of the plane. Still hanging from the engine, Peter sees the plane flying straight at the city.]\
\
Peter: Oh, my god.\
\
[Peter shoots his web at the right wing of the plane and pulls on it to change the plane\'92s direction. On the streets, passersby watch the plane flying overhead. Vulture tears open the ceiling and holds a box in his claws.]\
\
Mason: Get out of there! What are you doing?\
\
[Peter continues to struggle with the plane.]\
\
Peter: Please turn! Please turn!\
\
[The plane narrowly misses crashing into the city and heads toward Coney Island. Instead of escaping, Vulture tries to hold onto a box.]\
\
[Happy, sitting comfortably in a chair, jumps up. He looks out and sees Tony\'92s plane flying straight at Coney Island.]\
\
[The plane hits a ride and crash-lands on the beach of Coney Island. Peter loses hold of the plane and rolls down the beach. Everything is consumed in smoke and flames. Peter slowly gets up and takes off his mask. His ears are ringing. He has just staggered up to his feet when, suddenly, Vulture flies toward him and attacks him. Sparks fly from Vulture\'92s wings; it is clear that he has suffered some serious damage, too.]\
\
Toomes: Hey, Pedro.\
\
[Vulture continues to attack Peter. Peter shoots his web, but misses and gets pinned to the ground like a bird of prey. He screams as Vulture grabs him tightly with his claws and rains down punches at him. When Peter grabs Vulture\'92s fist to prevent another blow, Vulture flies up and lets go of him. Peter avoids serious injury by shooting a strand of web and holding on to Vulture, but Vulture cuts it off and throws him to the ground. He then slams Peter into the ground a few times. Peter flips onto his back in a sluggish way, then looks up at Vulture, who picks him up by the hood of his Spider-Man costume. Vulture is holding Peter there, studying his limp body, when he spots a crate.]\
\
Toomes: Bingo.\
\
[Vulture lets go of Peter, takes his goggles off, and grabs the crateful of arc reactors. Sparks rain down from his wing suit when he tries to lift the crate, but Vulture does not stop.]\
\
Peter: Your wing suit. Your wing suit\'92s gonna explode!\
\
[Lifting his weary arm, Peter shoots a strand of web at the crate and pulls with all his might. A tug of war ensues.]\
\
Toomes: Time to go home, Pete.\
\
Peter: I\'92m trying to save you!\
\
[Vulture cuts the web with his wing and tries to fly off. Peter presses the button on his web shooter, but it doesn\'92t work. He looks up to see the wing suit failing and covers his head. Vulture drops to the ground along with his wing suit. An explosion consumes him.]\
\
Peter: No.\
\
[Peter struggles up and runs into the flames. He spots Toomes and tries to lift the wing suit off him, but screams as he makes contact with hot metal. However, he doesn\'92t give up. He picks the wing suit up, finds Toomes, and carries him away from the flames. Peter lays Toomes down on the beach. Wheezing and coughing from the smoke, Toomes looks up at Peter, who returns his gaze.]\
\
[The flames have died out a little. A search party is scouring the beach. Happy finds Vulture tied to a pile of crates with spiderweb. A note is attached beside him: \'93FOUND FLYING VULTURE GUY. SPIDER-MAN. P.S. SORRY ABOUT YOUR PLANE.\'94 Happy raises his head and looks around as if searching for someone.]\
\
[Fire engines pass by the Cyclone. Peter is sitting on top of it. He closes his eyes, wounded and weary.]\
\
[Midtown High. Students are taking down a homecoming banner. Below it, Ned and Peter walk down the corridor.]\
\
Ned: It looked so insane. That whole... Like, it was just crazy. He, he was just like, \'93Zzzz,\'94 and you were like, \'93Ah!\'94\
\
Peter: Shh.\
\
Ned: And then I just hit him with the \'93pew.\'94 It was so, oh, my god.\
\
Peter: You saved me. It was awesome.\
\
[Peter spots Liz at the end of the corridor. Her mom is walking beside her with a box full of her belongings. Betty runs to Liz and hugs her. Peter runs toward them.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Liz!\
\
Betty: I\'92m gonna miss you.\
\
Liz: Bye.\
\
Peter: Liz.\
\
[Liz waits for Peter, wiping tears off her face.]\
\
Peter: Liz, look. I\'92m so sorry.\
\
Liz: You say that a lot. What are you sorry for this time?\
\
[When Peter fails to answer:]\
\
Liz: The dance? That was a pretty crappy thing to do.\
\
Peter: Well, yeah, but I... I mean, your dad... I can\'92t imagine what you\'92re going through. If there\'92s anything I can do to help...\
\
Liz: (fighting tears) I guess we\'92re moving to Oregon. Mom says it\'92s nice there, so that\'92s cool. Anyways, Dad doesn\'92t want us here during the trial, so...\
\
Peter: Liz, I... I...\
\
Liz: Bye, Peter. Whatever\'92s going on with you, I hope you figure it out.\
\
[Liz leaves the school with her mother. Peter watches her go.]\
\
[In the library, Mr. Harrington brings the Decathlon trophy to a table of students.]\
\
Mr. Harrington: Congratulations, Decathlon national champions.\
\
Decathlon Team: (clapping) Yeah!\
\
Mr. Harrington: I\'92m gonna have to put this back in the trophy case soon, but just for motivation right now at this practice. I\'92m a little ahead of the game, but we will need a new team captain next year. So I\'92m appointing Michelle.\
\
[The students turn to Michelle and clap.]\
\
Decathlon Team: Yeah!\
\
Michelle: Uh, thank you. My friends call me M.J.\
\
Ned: I thought you didn\'92t have any friends.\
\
Michelle: I didn\'92t.\
\
[Peter\'92s cell phone vibrates. He picks the broken phone up and reads a message from an unknown number: \'93Go to the bathroom.\'94]\
\
Peter: I... I gotta go.\
\
Michelle: Hey, where you going?\
\
[Peter freezes as he thinks of an excuse. Michelle stares at him, eyes filled with suspicion.]\
\
Michelle: What are you hiding, Peter?\
\
[Peter\'92s lips open, but no sound comes out. Suddenly, a grin breaks out on Michelle\'92s face.]\
\
Michelle: I\'92m just kidding. I don\'92t care. Bye. (to Decathlon team) All right, so we should run some drills.\
\
Ned: Yeah.\
\
[Michelle watches with curious eyes as Peter stands to leave.]\
\
[Peter rounds the corner and finds Happy waiting for him in the bathroom.]\
\
Peter: Hey, Happy. What, uh... What are you doing here?\
\
Happy: I really owe you one. I don\'92t know what I would do without this job. I mean, before I met Tony-\
\
[A toilet flushes and cuts him off. They awkwardly stand there as Tiny McKeever comes out, washes his hands, wipes them, and leaves the bathroom, throwing a long, confused glance at them. Finally:]\
\
Peter: So, uh, how long you been here?\
\
Happy: Long enough to be awkward. Boss wants to see you.\
\
Peter: (whispers) Is he here too?\
\
Happy: In the toilet? No, he\'92s upstate.\
\
Peter: Upstate? Like, upstate-upstate?\
\
Happy: Yeah, let\'92s go.\
\
[Inside Happy's car. Dashboard display says: \'93You may take your hands off the steering wheel.\'94]\
\
Happy: Take a look. It\'92s pretty impressive, huh?\
\
[Outside the window, we see the New Avengers Facility.]\
\
Happy: They just finished remodeling the whole thing.\
\
[Peter studies the facility with an awed expression. We see the reflection of a Quinjet taking off.]\
\
[Inside the compound, Peter watches a Quinjet fly off with a huge grin.]\
\
Happy: You don\'92t see that every day.\
\
[Tony approaches them.]\
\
Tony: Oh, there they are. How was the ride up?\
\
Happy: Good.\
\
Tony: Give me a minute with the kid.\
\
Happy: Seriously?\
\
Tony: Yeah. I gotta talk to the kid.\
\
Happy: I\'92ll be close behind.\
\
Tony: How about a loose follow? All right? Boundaries are good.\
\
[Tony playfully punches Peter in the shoulder, then puts an arm around him.]\
\
Tony: Sorry I took your suit. I mean, you had it coming. Actually, it turns out it was the perfect sort of tough-love moment that you needed, right? To urge you on, right? Wouldn\'92t you think? Don\'92t you think?\
\
Peter: Yeah, yeah, I guess.\
\
Tony: Let\'92s just say it was.\
\
[Tony sighs and continues leading Peter towards a door.]\
\
Peter: Mr. Stark, I really-\
\
Tony: You screwed the pooch hard. Big time. But then you did the right thing. Took the dog to the free clinic, you raised the hybrid puppies... All right, not my best analogy. (beat) I was wrong about you. I think, with a little more mentoring, you could be a real asset to the team.\
\
Peter: To the... To the team?\
\
Tony: Yeah. Anyway... (points at a door) There\'92s about fifty reporters behind that door. Real ones, not bloggers.\
\
[He presses some buttons on his watch and a secret compartment in the wall opens, revealing a brand new Spider-Man suit, the Iron Spider Armor.]\
\
Tony: When you\'92re ready... Why don\'92t you try that on? And I\'92ll introduce the world to the newest official member of the Avengers: Spider-Man.\
\
Peter: I...\
\
[Peter chuckles, amazed.]\
\
Tony: Yeah. Give that a look.\
\
[Peter continues to admire the Iron Spider Armor.]\
\
Tony: So, after the press conference, Happy will show you to your room, your new quarters. (to Happy) Where\'92s he between? He\'92s next to Vision?\
\
Happy: Yeah, Vision\'92s not big on doors.\
\
Tony: It\'92s fun.\
\
Happy: Or walls.\
\
Tony: (to Peter) You\'92ll fit right in.\
\
[Peter hesitates for a moment, then turns to Tony.]\
\
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. But I\'92m good.\
\
Tony: You\'92re good? Good? How are you good?\
\
Peter: Well, I mean, I\'92m... I\'92d rather just stay on the ground for a little while. Friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Somebody\'92s got to look out for the little guy, right?\
\
[Tony takes off his sunglasses and stares into Peter\'92s eyes.]\
\
Tony: You turning me down? You better think about this. (pointing at the new Spider-Man suit) Look at that. Look at me. Last chance, yes or no?\
\
Peter: No.\
\
Tony: Okay. It\'92s kind of a Springsteen-y, working class hero vibe that I dig. Uh, Happy will take you home. Yeah?\
\
Happy: Yeah. (to Peter) Mind waiting in the car? I need a minute.\
\
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark.\
\
Tony: Yes, Mr. Parker. Very well.\
\
[Tony and Peter shake hands.]\
\
Peter: See you around.\
\
Tony: Okay.\
\
[Peter starts to leave with a spring in his step, but then slows to a stop and turns to Tony, who is putting the Iron Spider Armor away with a tap on his watch.]\
\
Peter: That was a test, right? There\'92s, uh, nobody back there?\
\
Tony: Yes, you passed. All right, skedaddle there, young buck.\
\
Peter: Thank you, Mr. Stark. Thank you.\
\
Tony: Yeah, thank you.\
\
[Peter walks away.]\
\
Happy: Told you he\'92s a good kid.\
\
[Tony shrugs. A door behind him opens, revealing a room full of reporters. We can hear their excited murmurs. Pepper comes out with a somewhat frenzied, annoyed look when she realizes that Peter is not there.]\
\
Pepper: Where\'92s the kid?\
\
Happy: He left.\
\
Pepper: Everybody\'92s waiting.\
\
Tony: You know what? He actually made a really mature choice. It just surprised the heck out of us.\
\
Pepper: Did you guys screw this up?\
\
Tony: (points at Happy) He told the kid to go wait in the car.\
\
Pepper: Are you kidding me? I have a room full of people in there waiting for some big announcement. What am I gonna tell them?\
\
Tony: Think of something. How about, um... Hap, you still got that ring?\
\
Happy: Do I... I, uh...\
\
[Happy makes a show of patting his pockets to find the ring.]\
\
Tony: The engagement ring?\
\
Happy: Are you kidding? I\'92ve been carrying this since 2008.\
\
[He holds up the engagement ring. Beat, then:]\
\
Tony: Okay.\
\
Pepper: I think I can think of something better than that.\
\
Tony: Well, it would buy us a little time.\
\
[Pepper kisses Tony with a smile on her lips.]\
\
Tony: Like we need time.\
\
Pepper: I can\'92t believe you have that thing in your pocket.\
\
[She starts to walk back towards the conference room.]\
\
Tony: Want me to get the door for you, hon?\
\
Pepper: I got it.\
\
[Tony quickly follows her, catching the ring that Happy throws to him.]\
\
[Peter walks out of the facility. A smile blossoms on his face.]\
\
Peter: Aunt May, did you do dinner already?\
\
[Peter enters his apartment and throws his keys on a table. He stops when he finds a brown paper bag that says \'93This belongs to you. -TS\'94 sitting on his bed. Taking out his earphones, Peter calls out:]\
\
Peter: May?\
\
[No answer. Peter gets into his Spider-Man suit, then pulls off the mask. Reveal May standing in the doorway behind him.]\
\
May: What the fu...?\
\
[Prison. Toomes walks through a cell block. Mac Gargan, the Scorpion, approaches.]\
\
Gargan: Look who it is! What are the odds you and I\'92d end up in the same summer camp? Relax. This? (points at the scar on his forehead) It\'92s not on you. It\'92s on our, uh... little spider friend. I\'92ve got some boys on the outside who would love to meet him. You know, take a picture, slice his throat, put his head in a dryer. And I heard a rumor... you know who he is.\
\
[Toomes smiles almost imperceptibly.]\
\
Toomes: If I knew who he was, he\'92d already be dead.\
\
[Gargan stares at him with one eye severely bloodshot.]\
\
Guard: Toomes, your family\'92s here.\
\
[Toomes walks away, smiling.]\
\
An empty white screen. Captain America enters frame in his uniform.\
\
Steve: Hi. I\'92m Captain America. Here to talk to you about one of the most valuable traits a soldier or student can have. Patience. Sometimes patience is the key to victory. Sometimes it leads to very little. It seems like it\'92s not worth it. And you wonder why you waited so long for something so disappointing.\
\
[He uncomfortably glares at someone off-screen.]\
\
Steve: How many more of these?\
\
[Cut to black.]\
\
(Shows the Iron Man suits getting destroyed.)\
\
Tony Stark (V.O.): We create our own demons. Who said that? What does that even mean? Doesn't matter, I said it cause he said it. So now he was famous and that's basically get said by two well known guys. I don't, uh... (Sighs)\
\
(Screen goes black.)\
\
Tony Stark (V.O.): I'm gonna start again. Let's track this from the beginning.\
\
(Effel 65's "I'm Blue" playing over the MARVEL logo.)\
\
(1999, Bern, Switzerland, New Years Eve Party.)\
\
Happy Hogan: (to Maya.) Half hour till the ball drops.\
\
Tony Stark: Hey, do you want...?\
\
Party Guest: Tony Stark? Great speech, man!\
\
(Hogan moves the man away from Tony.)\
\
Happy Hogan: I got you, pal.\
\
Tony Stark: I gave a speech? How was it?\
\
Happy Hogan: Pitiful\
\
Maya Hansen: Unintelligible.\
\
Tony Stark: Really?\
\
Maya Hansen: Mmm-hmm.\
\
Tony Stark: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.\
\
(They start walking together.)\
\
Maya Hansen: Where are we going?\
\
Tony Stark: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.\
\
Maya Hansen: Okay, you can see my research, but that's...I'm not gonna show you my "town."\
\
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark\
\
(As Tony & Maya are walking away the man intercepts them.) Ho Yinsen.\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, I finally met a man called "Ho."\
\
(Tony & Yinsen shake hands. While, Yinsen chuckles humorlessly; Tony turns to Maya.) Come here.\
\
Ho Yinsen: I would like to introduce you to our guest, Dr. Wu.\
\
(Yinsen moves them towards Wu.)\
\
Tony Stark: [to Wu] Oh, this guy.\
\
Ho Yinsen: Mr. Stark.\
\
Tony Stark: Hey. (Dr. Wu greets Tony in mandarin as they shake hands.) You're a heart doctor. She's going to need a cardiologist after I... (Tony turns, starts blowing on his party horn & walks away with Maya.)\
\
Maya Hansen: Bye.\
\
Ho Yinsen: Perhaps another time.\
\
Tony Stark (V.O.): It started in Bern, Switzerland, 1999.\
\
(People yelling indistinctly.) The old days.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Mr. Stark!\
\
Tony Stark (V.O.): I never thought they'd come back to bite me. Why would they? [As Tony and Maya walk towards the elevator an enthusiastic man with long hair comes up towards them]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Oh, wow! Hey, Tony! Aldrich Killian. (Stuttering To Maya) I'm a big fan of your work!\
\
Maya Hansen: My work?\
\
Tony Stark: Who isn't? He means me.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Well, of course. But, Miss Hansen, my organization has been tracking your research since year two of MIT.\
\
[Tony, Maya and Hogan walk into the elevator]\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah, we're full.\
\
[Hogan puts his arms out to stop Aldrich from coming inside, but he ducks under Hogan's arms and moves into the elevator]\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.\
\
[Hogan traps Aldrich by the wall]\
\
Happy Hogan: What floor are you going to, pal?\
\
Aldrich Killian: Oh, now, that is an appropriate question. The ground floor, actually. I've got a proposal I'm putting together with myself. It's a privately funded think tank called, Advanced Idea Mechanics. [He holds out two business cards towards Tony and Maya]\
\
Tony Stark: Uh... she'll take both.\
\
Maya Hansen: Okay. [takes the cards]\
\
Tony Stark: One to throw away and one to not call.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Advanced Idea Mechanics, or AIM for short. (Points to the logo on his shirt) Do you get it?\
\
Tony Stark: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Aw!\
\
Tony Stark: (to the party of women in the elevator; referring to Hogan as they walk out) Ladies, follow the mullet.(To Maya) Ladies first.\
\
Maya Hansen: (to Aldrich as she walks out of the elevator) Thank you, I'll call you.\
\
[as everyone walks out of the elevator, Tony stops Aldrich from getting out by putting out his arm in front of him]\
\
Tony Stark: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Yeah?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes. [steps out of the elevator] I'm just going to try to get my beef wet real quick. You know what I'm talkin' about?\
\
Aldrich Killian: I'll see you up there.\
\
[the elevator door closes]\
\
Tony Stark: Damn betcha.\
\
[Scene change to Maya's room\}\
\
Tony Stark: Come on! I thought that was just a theory.\
\
Maya Hansen: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...\
\
[we see they are looking at a computer monitor with graph of the brain]\
\
Tony Stark: Wow.\
\
Maya Hansen: ...And chemically recode it.\
\
Tony Stark: That's incredible. Essentially you're hacking into the genetic...\
\
Both: ...Genetic operating system...\
\
Tony Stark: ...of a...\
\
Maya Hansen: Exactly.\
\
Tony: ...living organism.\
\
Maya Hansen: Yes.\
\
Tony Stark: Wow.\
\
[Hogan touches Maya's plant]\
\
Maya Hansen: Is that... Can you...\
\
Happy Hogan: What?\
\
Maya Hansen: Can you not touch my plant. It's not...she doesn't like it. She prefers...\
\
Tony Stark: She's not like the others.\uc0\u8203 \u8203 \u8203 \u8203 \u8203 \u8203  (to Maya) Come on. Let's go in the bedroom. Happy...\
\
Maya Hansen: That's cute, but...\
\
Tony Stark: Leave her ficus alone.\
\
Maya Hansen: [turns to Hogan] Because... and, no, seriously don't. [walks into the bedroom]\
\
Tony Stark: And you're starting with plants?\
\
Maya Hansen: For now, yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: Huh.\
\
Maya Hansen: I'm calling it Extremis.\
\
[Happy reaches for the plant and pulls off some leaves to just throw them on the ground.]\
\
[Tony and Maya continue talking about her research in the bedroom]\
\
Maya Hansen: Well, it's...\
\
Both: Human application.\
\
Maya Hansen: Exactly! Exactly.\
\
[Zooms in on the plant and it's growing a new "Limb"]\
\
Maya Hansen: Dendritic revitalization.\
\
Tony Stark: It's revolutionary.\
\
Maya Hansen: Disease prevention...\
\
Tony Stark: Changes the world.\
\
Maya Hansen: ...even limb regrowth.\
\
[Goes back to Maya and Tony]\
\
Tony Stark: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.\
\
Maya Hansen: Wow.\
\
Tony Stark: In Switzerland.\
\
Maya Hansen: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.\
\
Tony: This week.\
\
[Maya takes off Tony's glasses, Tony laughs]\
\
Tony Stark: You almost bought it, didn't you?\
\
[Maya puts on the glasses and Happy shuts the door. He nods and they start kissing to be interrupted by an explosion and glass shattering.]\
\
Maya Hansen: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.\
\
Tony Stark: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?\
\
Maya Hansen: The what?\
\
[at that moment Hogan runs into the room and tackles Tony onto the bed to make sure he's okay]\
\
Happy Hogan: Down! Stay down! Stay down, boss.\
\
Tony Stark: We're good.\
\
Happy Hogan: Stay down.\
\
Tony Stark: You're...you're right on me. I made it. (Happy gets up) What the hell was that?\
\
[People counting down outside.]\
\
Happy Hogan: What was that?\
\
Maya Hansen: It's a glitch in my work. It's...\
\
Tony Stark: She was just talking about it. Glitches happening.\
\
Happy Hogan: It's not Y2K.\
\
Maya Hansen: No.\
\
[Tony hears people celebrating outside]\
\
Tony Stark: Hey!\
\
Happy Hogan: Happy New Year.\
\
Tony Stark: Happy New Year.\
\
Maya Hansen: Happy New Year.\
\
Tony Stark: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.\
\
[Tony shakes hands with Hogan]\
\
Happy Hogan: You good?\
\
Tony Stark: Yep.\
\
Happy Hogan: I'll be right outside.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay.\
\
[Hogan leaves the room; we then see Aldrich on top of the building waiting for Tony, who never shows]\
\
Tony Stark: [voice over] So why am I telling you this? Because I had just created demons, and I didn't even know it.\
\
[we see Tony writing a note 'You know who I am', and leaving it on the bedside table for Maya before leaving; Maya hears the door close]\
\
Tony Stark: [voice over] Yeah, those were the good times. Then I moved on. After a brief soiree in an Afghan cave, I said goodbye to the party scene. Forgot that night in Switzerland. These days I'm a changed man, I'm different now. I'm well... you know who I am.\
\
[Present Day, Malibu, California - Tony is in his lab injecting himself with some devices]\
\
Tony Stark: Ow!\
\
JARVIS: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...\
\
Tony Stark: No. Forty-eight. [he injects himself] Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.\
\
JARVIS: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.\
\
Tony Stark: Which I will. Right, let's do this.\
\
[to the robot that's using a broom to clear the rubbish off the floor]\
\
Tony Stark: Dummy. Hi, Dummy. How did you get that cap on your head? You earned it.\
\
[Tony walks towards the robot]\
\
Tony Stark: Hey. Hey! What are you doing round in the corner? You know what you did. Blood on my mat, handle it.\
\
JARVIS: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.\
\
[addressing the Iron Man suits that are in their glass cages]\
\
Tony Stark: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.\
\
[to Jarvis as he records Tony with a camera]\
\
Tony Stark: Start tight and go wide, stamp in time. Mark 42 autonomous prehensile propulsion suit test. Initialize sequence.\
\
[Tony raises his hands and motions to activate the new suit]\
\
Tony Stark: Jarvis, drop my needle.\
\
[music starts playing, Tony moves with the music then points his arm where he'd been injecting himself toward the dismantled Iron Man suit on the table opposite, nothing happens]\
\
Tony Stark: Crap.\
\
[Tony bites his arm where he'd injected himself once and then hits it five times, he points his arm again and this time a part of the suit flies over to Tony and attaches itself to his hand and extends to his arm and shoulder, Tony then points his other arm toward the suit and the second part attaches itself to his hand and arm, Tony laughs]\
\
Tony Stark: Alright, I think we got this. Send 'em all.\
\
[the leg part flies over and attaches itself to Tony's leg, then as another part flies over it crashes into one of the Iron Man suit glass cages, then another part hurls itself at Tony and Tony inflects it with his arm making it crash]\
\
Tony Stark: Probably a little fast, slow it down. Slow it down just a...\
\
[suddenly another part of the suit shoots over and Tony ducks as it narrowly misses hitting him in the head]\
\
Tony Stark: ...little bit.\
\
[the other parts fly over and attach themselves with force to Tony's back and crotch area]\
\
Tony Stark: Cool it, will you, Jarvis?\
\
[then all the other parts shoot over and get attached to Tony, accept for the final face piece, which just hovers, facing Tony]\
\
Tony Stark: Come on. I ain't scared of you.\
\
[the face piece flies over and Tony flips over to grab the piece and finally the Iron Man suit is fully attached to Tony]\
\
Tony Stark: I'm the best.\
\
[at that moment, one of the stray pieces of the suit shoot over to Tony, knock hims down, which knocks the entire suit, except for the head piece, off Tony]\
\
JARVIS: As always, sir, a great pleasure watching you work.\
\
Tony Stark: [voice over] And I guess seventy-two hours isn't a long time between siesta's. Didn't think it could get any worse. Then I had to go and turn on the TV.\
\
[the news on TV shows footage of The Mandarin]\
\
Tony Stark: [voice over] That's when he happened.\
\
The Mandarin: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.\
\
[as this footage ends, the TV channels change and all the news channels are talking about The Mandarin]\
\
[the news on TV shows President Ellis addresses The Mandarin Threat]\
\
News Reporter #1: And now that we seem to be back, let's recap some of the frightening...\
\
News Reporter #2: American Airwaves were highjacked...\
\
News Reporter #3: The nation remains on high alert...\
\
News Reporter #4: All attempts to find the Mandarin have so far proved unsuccessful...\
\
President Ellis: Central to my Administration's response to this terrorist event, is a newly minted resource. I know him as Colonel James Rhodes, the American people will soon know him as the Iron Patriot.\
\
[we then see Bill Maher talking about this on his show]\
\
Bill Maher: And how is President Ellis responding? By taking the guy they call War Machine and giving him a paint job.\
\
[then we see Joan Rivers on 'The Fashion Police' talking about the new Iron Man suit]\
\
Joan Rivers: Same suit, but painted red, white, and blue. Look at rhat. And they also renamed him Iron Patriot. You know, just in case the paint was too subtle.\
\
[Rhodes and Tony Stark are at a bar and they see Joan Rivers making fun of the Iron Patriot suit on TV]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: It tested well with focus groups, alright?\
\
Tony Stark: [putting on a mocking voice] I am Iron Patriot...\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.\
\
Tony Stark: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?\
\
[Tony moves closer to Rhodes]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.\
\
Tony Stark: Nine.\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.\
\
Tony Stark: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?\
\
Tony Stark: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: People are concerned about you, Tony. I'm concerned about you.\
\
Tony Stark: You're gonna come at me like that?\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: No. No, look, I'm not trying to be a dic...\
\
[a girl and a boy come up to their table]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: ...tator.\
\
Erin: Do you mind signing my drawing?\
\
Tony Stark: If Richard doesn't mind. [to Rhodes] You alright with this, Dick?\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Fine with me.\
\
[Tony looks at the drawing of himself in his Iron Man suit that the girl has drawn]\
\
Tony Stark: [To the girl] What's your name?\
\
Erin: Erin.\
\
[Tony looks at the boy standing next to him]\
\
Tony Stark: I loved you in A Christmas Story, by the way.\
\
[as Tony is signing Erin's drawing]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After what happened in New York... aliens, come on. They need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority, but it's not...\
\
Tony Stark: It's not superhero business, I get it.\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.\
\
Tony Stark: That's why I said I...got it.\
\
[suddenly as Tony is signing the drawing he looks ill, he places his hand on his face]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Are you okay?\
\
Tony Stark: I broke the crayon.\
\
Erin: Are you okay, Mr. Stark?\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Take it easy. Tony...\
\
Little Boy: [the little boy whispers to Tony] How did you get out of the wormhole? How did you get out of the wormhole?\
\
[suddenly Tony rises and starts walking off]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Wait a minute! Tony!\
\
[Rhodes follows Tony as he walks out the bar]\
\
Tony Stark: What'd he say?!\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Tony!\
\
Tony Stark: Sorry. Have to check on the suit...make sure...okay.\
\
[Tony steps into his Iron Man suit that was parked outside the bar and collapses to his knees]\
\
Tony Stark: Check the heart, check the...check the...is it the brain?\
\
JARVIS: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, so I was poisoned?\
\
Jarvis: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.\
\
Tony Stark: Me?\
\
[Rhodes knocks on the Iron Suit's head, people have gathered around them watching Tony]\
\
Colonel James Rhodes: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.\
\
Tony Stark: Sorry, I gotta split.\
\
[Tony flies off in his suit]\
\
[at Stark Industries Hogan points to his badge as walks through the lobby passing the other employees]\
\
Happy Hogan: Badge. Badge. Come on, badge. Badge, guys. I put a memo in the toilet, come on. [referring to Tony's robots as Hogan meets with Pepper] Tony has got them in his basement, they're wearing party hats. This is an asset that we can put to use.\
\
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh. So, you're suggesting that I replace the entire janitorial staff with robots?\
\
Happy Hogan: What I'm saying is that the human element of Human Resources is our biggest point of vulnerability. We should start phasing it out immediately.\
\
Pepper Potts: What!?\
\
Happy Hogan: [to another employee as Hogan walks past them] Excuse me, Bambi.\
\
Pepper Potts: [Hogan points to his badge] Did you just say that?\
\
Happy Hogan: Security.\
\
Pepper Potts: Happy?\
\
Happy Hogan: Yes.\
\
Pepper Potts: Okay, I am thrilled that you're now the Head of Security, okay? It is the perfect position for you.\
\
Happy Hogan: Thank you.\
\
Pepper Potts: However...\
\
Happy Hogan: I do appreciate it\
\
Pepper Potts: Since you've taken the post...\
\
Happy Hogan: You don't have to thank me.\
\
Pepper Potts: We've had a rise in staff complaints of three hundred percent\
\
Happy Hogan: Thank you.\
\
Pepper Potts: That's not a compliment.\
\
Happy Hogan: That's not a compli...? It is a compliment! Clearly somebody's trying to hide something.\
\
Pepper Potts: I...\
\
Pepper's Assistant: Excuse me.\
\
Pepper Potts: Yes?\
\
Pepper's Assistant: Miss Potts, your four o'clock is here.\
\
Pepper Potts: Thank you.\
\
Happy Hogan: Did you clear this four o'clock with me?\
\
Pepper Potts: Happy, we'll talk about this later. But right now I have to go deal with this very annoying thing.\
\
[Pepper starts walking towards her office]\
\
Happy Hogan: How so?\
\
Pepper Potts: I used to work with him, and he used to ask me out all the time. So it's a little awkward.\
\
[Hogan opens her office glass door and they enter]\
\
Happy Hogan: I don't like the sound of that.\
\
[as they step inside, they see Aldrich, looking handsome and fit in a business suit]\
\
[Pepper looks shocked at the change in Aldrich's appearance]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Pepper.\
\
Pepper Potts: Killian?\
\
Aldrich Killian: You look great. You look really great.\
\
Pepper Potts: God, you look...you look great. I... I...I can't... What on earth have you been doing?\
\
Aldrich Killian: Nothing fancy, just five years in the hands of physical therapists. And please, call me Aldrich.\
\
Happy Hogan: Uh...you were supposed to be issued a security badge.\
\
Pepper Potts: Happy, it's okay.\
\
Happy Hogan: Yes?\
\
Pepper Potts: We're good.\
\
Happy Hogan: You sure?\
\
Pepper Potts: Yes. Stand down.\
\
Happy Hogan: Okay. I'm gonna linger, right here.\
\
Pepper Potts: Thank you.\
\
Happy Hogan: Okay.\
\
[Hogan steps out of Pepper's office and closes the glass door]\
\
Pepper Potts: It's very nice to see you, Killian.\
\
[as Hogan waits outside Pepper's office, he sees Aldrich's man sitting in the waiting area]\
\
Happy Hogan: Hey, guy.\
\
[Hogan points to his security badge and the guy picks up his badge from the table next to him and holds it up to show Hogan he has a badge; to an employee as they walk past him]\
\
Savin: Merry Christmas.\
\
[Hogan looks at him with suspicion]\
\
[back in Pepper's office]\
\
Aldrich Killian: After years dodging the President's ban on "immoral biotech research", my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis. I'm gonna turn your lights down.\
\
[he dims the lights then holds in his hand three small metal balls]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Regard the human brain.\
\
[he throws the balls onto the coffee table and as they roll and stop, they project a 3d image into the room]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Uh...wait. Hold on, hold on. That's...that's the universe, my bad. But if I do that...\
\
[he presses his projector control which changes the 3d image to show inside of the brain]\
\
Aldrich Killian: That's the brain. Strangely mimetic though, wouldn't you say?\
\
Pepper Potts Wow, that's amazing!\
\
Aldrich Killian: Thanks, it's mine.\
\
Pepper Potts: What?\
\
Aldrich Killian: This...you're inside my head. It's a...\
\
[he taps behind his ear, referring to something embedded inside his head]\
\
Aldrich Killian: It's a live feed. Come on up, I'll prove it to you.\
\
[Aldrich rises from the couch and stands on the coffee table]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Come on.\
\
[he helps Pepper to stand on the coffee table next to him, they stand directly in the 3d image]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Now, pinch my arm. I can take it. Pinch me.\
\
[Pepper pinches him and immediately something lights up in the 3d image of Aldrich's brain]\
\
Pepper Potts: What is that?\
\
Aldrich Killian: It's the primary somatosensory cortex. It's the brain's pain center. But this is what I wanted to show you.\
\
[he turns Pepper round and presses his projector control and starts changing and moving the image with his hand]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Now, Extremis harnesses our bioelectrical potential and it goes...here. This is essentially an empty slot, and what this tells us is that our mind, our entire DNA in fact, is destined to be upgraded.\
\
Pepper Potts: Wow.\
\
[as Hogan sits outside Pepper's office, he gets a call on his tablet, he answers the call and holds the tablet high so the camera monitor shows his forehead and eyes]\
\
Happy Hogan: Hello?\
\
Tony Stark: Is this forehead of Security?\
\
Happy Hogan: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.\
\
[we see Tony is in his lab]\
\
Tony Stark: What? Harassing interns?\
\
Happy Hogan: Let me tell you something, you know what happened when I told people I was Iron Man's body guard? They would laugh in my face.\
\
[Tony laughs]\
\
Happy Hogan: I had to leave while I still had a shred of dignity. Now I got a real job, I'm watching Pepper.\
\
Tony Stark: What's going on? Fill me in.\
\
Happy Hogan: For real?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
\
Happy Hogan: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.\
\
Tony Stark: Right.\
\
Happy Hogan: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?\
\
Tony Stark: Um...Switzerland.\
\
Happy Hogan: Right, right, exactly.\
\
Tony Stark: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.\
\
Happy Hogan: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.\
\
Tony Stark: His what?\
\
Happy Hogan: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? [he holds his tablet up and points it towards Pepper's glass office, where Aldrich and Pepper are standing close together on the coffee table watching the 3d image of the brain, but all Tony sees is Hogan pointing the tablet camera at himself]\
\
Tony Stark: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.\
\
Happy Hogan: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.\
\
Tony Stark: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.\
\
Happy Hogan: I can't! I don't know how to flip the screen! Don't talk to me like that anymore. You're not my boss.\
\
[as Hogan is talking, Tony uses his small tablet device to look up Aldrich and finds his photo]\
\
Happy Hogan: Alright, I don't work for you. Now I don't trust this guy. He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.\
\
Tony Stark: Relax.\
\
Happy Hogan: Seriously?\
\
Tony Stark: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?\
\
Happy Hogan: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.\
\
Tony Stark: A giant brain?\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.\
\
Tony Stark: I miss you, Happy.\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...\
\
Tony Stark: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?\
\
Happy Hogan: Why?\
\
Tony Stark: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.\
\
[he puts his small tablet in his wine fridge and closes it and walks off still with Hogan online]\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah, nice.\
\
[back in Pepper's office after Aldrich has show her his new research]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Imagine if you could hack into the hard drive of any living organism and recode its DNA.\
\
Pepper Potts: It would be incredible.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Mm.\
\
Pepper Potts: Unfortunately, to my ears it also sounds highly weaponizable. As in enhanced soldiers, private armies, and Tony is not...\
\
Aldrich Killian: Tony. Tony. You know, I invited Tony to join AIM thirteen years ago, he turned me down. But something tells me now there is a new genius on the throne who doesn't have to answer to Tony anymore, and who has slightly less of an ego.\
\
Pepper Potts: It's gonna be a no, Aldrich. As much as I'd like to help you.\
\
[we see Aldrich leaving the building]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Well, I can't say that I'm not disappointed. But then as my father used to say, 'Failure is the fog through which we glimpse triumph.'\
\
Pepper Potts: That's very deep.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Mm\
\
Pepper Potts: And I have no idea what it means.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Well, me neither. He was kind of an idiot, my old man.\
\
[Pepper laughs]\
\
Aldrich Killian: I'm sure I'll see you again, Pepper.\
\
[Aldrich kisses her gently on the cheek and Pepper watches him as he walks off, then Pepper notices Hogan coming toward her, Pepper looks flustered]\
\
Pepper Potts: Happy...\
\
Happy Hogan: The car is ready, if you're ready to go.\
\
[Pepper glances over to Aldrich as he walks towards his car]\
\
Pepper Potts: Yes. I just um... God, I forgot my... other thing, so... I'm just gonna...\
\
[she walks back into the building, Hogan glance over to Aldrich's car and as it drives away, Hogan takes a photo of the license plate]\
\
[later Pepper returns to Tony's home, as she gets out of the car she sees a large stuffed rabbit outside the house that Tony has bought for her as a gift, she walks inside]\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry I'm late. I was... What the...? What is that?!\
\
[she notices Tony sat in his Iron Man suit on the couch]\
\
Pepper Potts: You're wearing this in the house now? What is that, like Mark 15?\
\
[Tony looks at the small number marked 42 on the suit]\
\
Tony Stark: Uh...yeah. Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.\
\
Pepper Potts: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?\
\
[Tony rises and walks toward her]\
\
Tony Stark: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.\
\
[Tony shakes his ass and Pepper laughs]\
\
Tony Stark: Oh hey, did you see your Christmas present?\
\
Pepper Potts: Yes, I did. I...I don't know how I could have missed that Christmas present. Is it gonna fit through the door?\
\
Tony Stark: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.\
\
Pepper Potts: Okay.\
\
Tony Stark: So, uh...tense? Good day?\
\
[Tony walks up behind her and starts massaging her shoulders]\
\
Tony Stark: Ooh shoulders, a little naughty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?\
\
Pepper Potts: Did I like it?\
\
Tony Stark: Nailed it, right?\
\
Pepper Potts: Wow. I appreciate the thought very much.\
\
[Pepper turns to face Tony, she rises from her seat and stands close to him]\
\
Pepper Potts: So why don't you lift up that face mask and give me a kiss?\
\
[Tony knocks the metal helmet on his head]\
\
Tony Stark: Huh. Yup, dammit. No can do. You wanna just kiss it on the...\
\
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.\
\
Tony Stark: The facial slit?\
\
Pepper Potts: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?\
\
Tony Stark: Crowbar. Yeah.\
\
[Pepper starts walking towards Tony's lab]\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, except there's been a...uh...a radiation leak.\
\
Pepper Potts: I'll take my chances.\
\
Tony Stark: That's risky.\
\
[Pepper walks down the stairs to Tony's lab]\
\
Tony Stark: At least let me get you like a Hazmat suit or a Geiger counter or something like that.\
\
[Pepper sees Tony is in fact not in his Iron Man suit, but in the lab exercising as he remotely controls the suit, which follows Pepper into the lab]\
\
Tony Stark: Busted.\
\
Pepper Potts: This is a new level of lame.\
\
Tony Stark: Sorry.\
\
[Pepper notices the food tray in the corner]\
\
Pepper Potts: You ate without me, already? On date night?\
\
Tony Stark: [referring to Mark 42 suit] He was just...\
\
Pepper Potts: You mean you?\
\
Tony Stark: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.\
\
Pepper Potts: Uh-huh.\
\
Tony Stark: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.\
\
[Mark 42 suit turns its face toward her, as if to look at her accusingly]\
\
Pepper Potts: What?\
\
Tony Stark: What?\
\
Pepper Potts: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?\
\
Tony Stark: Happy was concerned.\
\
Pepper Potts: No, you're spying on me.\
\
Tony Stark: I wasn't...\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm going to bed.\
\
[Pepper turns and starts walking off]\
\
Tony Stark: Hold on. Come on. Pep.\
\
[as Pepper starts walking upstairs]\
\
Tony Stark: Hey, I admit it! My fault. Sorry.\
\
[Pepper stops and looks at him]\
\
Tony Stark: I'm a piping hot mess. It's been going on for a while, I haven't said anything.\
\
[Pepper walks back down]\
\
Tony Stark: Nothing's been the same since New York.\
\
Pepper Potts: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.\
\
Tony Stark: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.\
\
[he pauses for a moment and sits down]\
\
Tony Stark: But threat is imminent, and I have to protect the one thing that I can't live without. That's you. My suits, they're uh...\
\
Pepper Potts: Machines.\
\
Tony Stark: They're part of me.\
\
Pepper Potts: A distraction.\
\
Tony Stark: Maybe.\
\
[Pepper walks towards Tony and they hold each other. He rests his head against her chest and she removes his headband that controls the Iron Man suits]\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm gonna take a shower.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay.\
\
[Pepper turns to walk off, then stops and looks at him]\
\
Pepper Potts: And you're gonna join me.\
\
Tony Stark: Better.\
\
[later that night, as Tony and Pepper are sleeping, Tony starts having nightmares about when he was in New York with The Avengers and had to get rid of the nuke in space, Pepper wakes and starts to shake Tony awake]\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony...\
\
[suddenly Pepper gets grabbed and shoved off Tony by Mark 42 suit, this wakes Tony who commands the suit]\
\
Tony Stark: Power down!\
\
[the suit shuts down and Tony hits it making its pieces fall apart, he looks over at Pepper who is in shock]\
\
Tony Stark: I must have called it in my sleep. That's not supposed to happen. I'll recalibrate the sensors. Can we just...just let me...just let me catch my breath, okay?\
\
[Pepper rises and starts to leave]\
\
Tony Stark: Don't go, alright? Pepper?\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm going to sleep downstairs. Tinker with that.\
\
[Pepper leaves the room]\
\
[at the Chinese theater in Los Angeles, we see Aldrich's henchman meet a man who's sat outside the theater]\
\
Savin: Can you regulate?\
\
Taggert: Yes, I can regulate.\
\
Savin: Are you sure about that?\
\
Taggert: Yes.\
\
[Hogan who's been following Savin, keeps an eye on him from a distance, he sees Savin giving the man a briefcase]\
\
Savin: It's a decent batch. Don't say I never did nothin' for you.\
\
Taggert: Thank you...I mean for understanding.\
\
[Savin walks off, Hogan walks towards Taggert and as Taggert rises to leave Hogan bumps into him which knock the briefcase out of Taggert's hand, falling open on to the ground]\
\
Happy Hogan: I'm sorry, buddy.\
\
[Hogan helps him put the stuff back in the suitcase, and as he looks at Taggert he notices that he is glowing red, Hogan starts to walk off taking one of the items from the suitcase, but suddenly Savin bumps into him]\
\
Savin: What are you doin', buddy? You out by yourself? A little date night? Watching your favorite chick flick maybe?\
\
Happy Hogan: Yeah, a little movie called "The Party's Over", starring you and your junkie girlfriend, and here's the ticket. [Hogan shows him what he took from Taggert's suitcase]\
\
Savin: No kidding? That doesn't belong to you. [Savin goes to take the item from Hogan's hand, but Hogan punches Savin in the face twice, Hogan notices Savin's face glow red and heal, then Savin grabs hold of Hogan and with super strength throws him aside, as Savin walks towards Hogan, Taggert begins to glow red and turn super hot]\
\
Taggert: Savin!\
\
Savin: What?\
\
Taggert: Help! Help me! [Taggert suddenly explodes, causing a massive explosion inside the theater which wounds Hogan, as he lies injured, Hogan sees Savin, also glowing red and then healing and walking off as if nothing has happened]\
\
[we see another TV footage from The Mandarin]\
\
The Mandarin: True story about fortune cookies. They look Chinese, they sound Chinese, but they're actually an American invention. Which is why they're hollow, full of lies, and leave a bad taste in the mouth. My disciples just destroyed another cheap American knock-off, The Chinese Theater. Mr. President, I know this must be getting frustrating, but this season of terror is drawing to a close. And don't worry, the big one is coming; your graduation.\
\
[as Hogan lies in hospital critically injured, Tony is sat in his room when a nurse walks in to check on Hogan]\
\
Tony Stark: Hi.\
\
Happy's Nurse: Oh.\
\
Tony Stark: [referring to the TV] Uh...mind leaving that on?\
\
Happy's Nurse: Sure. [Tony rises from his seat]\
\
Tony Stark: Sunday night's PBS 'Downtown Abbey'. That's his show, he thinks it's elegant. [he pauses for a moment] One more thing...make sure everyone wears their badges. He's a stickler for that sort of thing, plus my guys won't let anyone in without them. [Tony turns to leave]\
\
[news reporters are all waiting for Tony outside the hospital]\
\
Hospital News Reporter: We're awaiting the arrival of Tony Stark. We're hoping he'll give us the reaction...his reaction to the latest attack. [Tony walks out and all the reporters swarm toward him] Mr. Stark! Mr. Stark! Our sources are telling us that this is another Mandarin attack. Anything else you can tell us? [Tony ignores the questions and walks toward his car]\
\
Pushy Tabloid Reporter: Hey, Mr. Stark! When is somebody gonna kill this guy? Just sayin'. [Tony turns to face the reporter]\
\
Tony Stark: Is that what you want? Here's a little Holiday greeting I've been wanting to send to the Mandarin. I just didn't know how to phrase it until now. My name is Tony Stark and I'm not afraid of you. I know you're a coward, so I've decided [He removes his sunglasses and stares into the phone's camera] that you just died, pal. I'm gonna come get the body. There's no politics here; it's just good old-fashioned revenge. There's no Pentagon; it's just you and me. And on the off-chance you're a man, here's my home address: 10-8-80, Malibu Point, 9-0-2-6-5. I'll leave the door unlocked. [to the reporter] That's what you wanted, right? [He takes the phone and throws it at a wall] Bill me. [Tony gets in his car and drives off]\
\
[as Tony is working his lab]\
\
JARVIS: I've compiled a Mandarin database for you, sir. Drawn from S.H.I.E.L.D., F.B.I., and C.I.A. intercepts. Initiating virtual crime scene reconstruction. [Tony starts looking at all the data gathered]\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, what do we got here? His name is an ancient Chinese war mantle, meaning "adviser to the King". South American insurgency tactics, talks like a Baptist preacher. There's lots of pageantry going on here...lots of theater. [Tony pushes the virtual information down to close] Close. [Tony looks at the virtual crime scene reconstruction]\
\
JARVIS: The heat from the blast was in excess of 3000 degrees Celsius. Any subjects within 12.5 yards were vaporized instantly.\
\
Tony Stark: No bomb parts found in a three mile radius of the Chinese theater.\
\
JARVIS: No, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: Talk to me, Happy. [in the virtual reconstruction, Tony sees Hogan pointing his finger at some dog tags] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] When is a bomb not a bomb? [Tony picks up the virtual image of the dog tags to investigate them further] Any military victims?\
\
JARVIS: Not according to public records, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.\
\
JARVIS: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.\
\
Tony Stark: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. [Tony looks at the information popping up] Nope. [he sees an attack in Rose Hill, Tennessee] That. You sure that's not one of his?\
\
JARVIS: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.\
\
Tony Stark: Bring her around.\
\
JARVIS: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. [Tony looks at all the information being presented on the Tennessee attack]\
\
Tony Stark: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?\
\
JARVIS: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. [as Tony is about to get ready to leave for Tennessee, he hears his door bell ring]\
\
Tony Stark: Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?\
\
JARVIS: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. [we see Maya standing outside Tony's house, the glass doors are opened and she enters]\
\
Tony Stark: Right there's fine. [Tony dressed in his Iron Man suit walks toward her] You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?\
\
Maya Hansen: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?\
\
Tony Stark: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.\
\
JARVIS: Gluten-free waffles, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: That's right.\
\
Maya Hansen: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.\
\
Tony Stark: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. [as he turns to walk into the living room, two bags are thrown down from the above balcony] It's...with her.\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony, is somebody there? [Tony steps out of his suit]\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. [Maya smiles] Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. [as Pepper starts walking downstairs, Tony moves towards Maya and speaks quietly] Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.\
\
Maya Hansen: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.\
\
Tony Stark: What...what for? Why now?\
\
Maya Hansen: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.\
\
Tony Stark: I'll be fine.\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.\
\
Tony Stark: We weren't.\
\
Maya Hansen: No, I...\
\
Pepper Potts: And old girlfriends!\
\
Tony Stark: She's not really.\
\
Maya Hansen: No, not really. It...it was just one night.\
\
Tony Stark: Yep.\
\
Pepper Potts: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.\
\
Tony Stark: It was a great night.\
\
Pepper Potts: Well, you know...\
\
Maya Hansen: Yeah.\
\
Pepper Potts: You have saved yourself a world of pain.\
\
Maya Hansen: I'm sure.\
\
Tony Stark: What?\
\
Pepper Potts: Trust me. [to Tony] We're going out of town.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.\
\
Pepper Potts: Yep!\
\
Tony Stark: The man says no.\
\
Pepper Potts: Immediately and indefinitely!\
\
Tony Stark: Honey...\
\
Maya Hansen: Great idea. Let's go.\
\
Tony Stark: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony, this is how normal people behave.\
\
Tony Stark: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... [Maya notices giant stuffed rabbit Tony had bought for Pepper]\
\
Maya Hansen: Is...is that normal?\
\
Tony Stark: Yes, this is normal!\
\
Pepper Potts: Sadly, that...is very normal.\
\
Tony Stark: It's a big bunny, relax about it!\
\
Pepper Potts: Calm down!\
\
Tony Stark: I got this for you.\
\
Pepper Potts: I'm aware of that.\
\
Tony Stark: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!\
\
Pepper Potts: I don't like it!\
\
Tony Stark: I asked you three... You don't like it?! [as Tony and Pepper are bickering, Maya notices on the TV that helicopters are coming toward Tony's home]\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.\
\
Tony Stark: I said no.\
\
Maya Hansen: Guys, can we um...\
\
Tony Stark: What?\
\
Maya Hansen: [she points to the bomb heading straight for the house] Do we need to worry about that? [The house is suddenly hit, as everything explodes around them, Tony manages to get his Iron Man suit onto Pepper to protect her from the fall, Tony looks over to Maya, who's lying unconscious on the ground, as the ceiling is about to fall on Tony, Pepper saves him with the Iron Man suit]\
\
Pepper Potts: I got you.\
\
Tony Stark: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here. [the helicopters starts shooting at the house] Move! I'm right behind! [as they run to get out, the floor between Pepper and Tony collapses] Get her, I'm gonna find a way around. [Pepper hesitates] Stop stopping! Get her, get outside! Go! [Pepper manages to grab Maya and use the Iron Man suit to get them safely out of the house, but the house gets further destroyed as the helicopters continue to fire on it]\
\
Pepper Potts: Oh my God. Tony! [back inside as the house is being destroyed around Tony]\
\
JARVIS: Sir, Miss Potts is clear of the structure. [Tony motions for his Iron Man suit to come off Pepper and onto him]\
\
Tony Stark: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!\
\
JARVIS: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. [Tony manages to fire a piano at a helicopter to destroy it]\
\
Tony Stark: That's one.\
\
JARVIS: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. [Tony manages to get away from the bullets being fired at him from one of the remaining helicopters and again uses his suit to bring down the helicopter]\
\
Tony Stark: That's two. [as the helicopter explodes it crashes into the house, the remaining helicopter continues on shooting at the house, finally the remains of house with Tony inside fall into the ocean, Pepper runs to the edge of the cliff and looks down into the ocean. In the water, Tony starts to feel like he's drowning]\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony!\
\
JARVIS: Sir, take a deep breath. [after a few moments Tony's suit gets its flight power activated by Jarvis] Flight power restored. [finally Tony manages to fly out of the ocean.]\
\
[The screen goes black]\
\
JARVIS: Sir. Sir!\
\
Tony Stark: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.\
\
JARVIS: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. [Tony notices that he's flying through the snow at night, he falls and crashes into the ground in the middle of a forest, he takes off his face helmet as he lies on the ground catching his breath]\
\
Tony Stark: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?\
\
JARVIS: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.\
\
Tony Stark: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...\
\
JARVIS: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.\
\
Tony Stark: Who asked you? Open the suit.\
\
JARVIS: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: Open eject. [the suit gets off Tony and he sits up] That's brisk! [as Tony starts to feel the cold weather.] Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.\
\
JARVIS: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. [the suit loses power]\
\
Tony Stark: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. [Tony drags the suit to a petrol station and makes a call to Pepper]\
\
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server: Now transferring to all known receivers.\
\
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. [Tony drags the suit to an abandoned looking farmhouse, he places the suit on a couch and sits next to it] Let's get you comfy. [he places its hand by its side] You happy now? [as Tony tries to fix the micro-repeater implants in his arm, a boy stands by the doorway and points his toy gun at Tony]\
\
Harley Keener: Freeze! Don't move.\
\
Tony Stark: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. [the boy points his gun at a glass on a shelf and shoots at it, breaking the glass] And now you're out of ammo.\
\
Harley Keener: What's that thing on your chest?\
\
Tony Stark: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.\
\
Harley Keener: What does it power? [Tony stands and points the desk light at his suit sitting on the couch behind him] Oh my God! [Harley drops his toy gun and takes a step towards Tony] Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?\
\
Tony Stark: Technically, I am.\
\
Harley Keener: Technically, you're dead. [he give Tony a newspaper which has Tony's picture with the headline 'Mandarin Attack: Stark presumed dead']\
\
Tony Stark: A valid point.\
\
Harley Keener: [referring to the suit as he sits next to it on the couch checking it out] What happened to him?\
\
Tony Stark: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.\
\
Harley Keener: Like a mechanic?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
\
Harley Keener: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.\
\
Tony Stark: [Interupting Harley] It's Iron Patriot now.\
\
Harley Keener: That's way cooler!\
\
Tony Stark: No, it's not.\
\
Harley Keener: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...\
\
Tony Stark: Retroreflective panels?\
\
Harley Keener: To make him stealth mode.\
\
Tony Stark: You want a stealth mode?\
\
Harley Keener: Cool, right?\
\
Tony Stark: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.\
\
Harley Keener: [as he touches the suit, Harley accidentally snaps off one of its fingers] Oops!\
\
Tony Stark: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.\
\
Harley Keener: S...Sorry.\
\
Tony Stark: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?\
\
Harley Keener: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.\
\
Tony Stark: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.\
\
Harley Keener: What's in it for me?\
\
Tony Stark: Salvation. What's his name?\
\
Harley Keener: Who?\
\
Tony Stark: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?\
\
Harley Keener: How'd you know that?\
\
Tony Stark: I got just the thing. [he opens a compartment on the suit and takes out a metal object] This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. [Harley reaches out to take it, but Tony pulls his hand away] Deal? Deal? What'd you say?\
\
Harley Keener: Deal.\
\
Tony Stark: Deal? [Tony gives the object to Harley] What's you're name?\
\
Harley Keener: Harley. And you're...\
\
Tony Stark: The mechanic. Tony [Tony looks at Harley for a moment] You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? [back at Tony's house, which is now surrounded by emergency rescue and news reporters, Pepper stands alone and looks out across the ocean. She sees one of Tony's shattered Iron Man helmets and pulls it towards her, her forehead resting against the helmet's. She sees a red flashing light inside the helmet and as she puts the helmet on she receives the message Tony had left her earlier]\
\
Computer Voice: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.\
\
Tony Stark: Pepper, it's me. [Pepper gasps and smiles] I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.\
\
[later that night as Pepper drives Maya home]\
\
Pepper Potts: Why were you at the house tonight? What was so important that you had to speak to Tony?\
\
Maya Hansen: [A beat] I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin. So if you still want to talk about it, I suggest that we get ourselves someplace safe.\
\
Pepper Potts: Your boss works for the Mandarin, you think? But Tony says you're a botanist, so...\
\
Maya Hansen: That figures. What I actually am is a biological DNA coder running a team of forty out of a privately-funded think tank, but sure you can call me a botanist.\
\
Pepper Potts: This boss of yours, does he have a name?\
\
Maya Hansen: Yeah, Aldrich Killian. [Pepper looks at her in shock]\
\
[we see Aldrich talking on the phone to Savin]\
\
Savin: Well, we took the house down, sir...\
\
Aldrich Killian: Mmhmm.\
\
Savin: But there's no sign of a body.\
\
Aldrich Killian: I see.\
\
Savin: No Stark.\
\
Aldrich Killian: I have to go. [Aldrich rises from his seat walks towards another room] The Master is about to record and he's a little... Well, you know how he gets. Keep your appointment tonight and call me when it's done. [Aldrich walks into a room which has been set up as a set with all of Mandarin's props in place and camera crew ready to record Mandarin's message] Alright everybody. No talking and no eye contact, unless you wanna get shot in the face.\
\
[we then see the Mandarin arrive with his entourage and enter the house]\
\
Mandarin Look-Out: The Master is travelling. [the Mandarin arrives on set and takes a sit, he looks at Aldrich]\
\
The Mandarin: Well then. What are we waiting for?\
\
[in Rose Hills, Tennessee, Tony and Harley walk in town at night]\
\
Tony Stark: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. [he pulls his sleeve up and we see he's wearing a little girl's pink watch, Harley laughs]\
\
Harley Keener: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?\
\
Tony Stark: Maybe never, relax about it.\
\
Harley Keener: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?\
\
Tony Stark: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. [they stop and Tony looks at the remains of the local explosion site that Tony came to investigate] What's the official story here? What happened?\
\
Harley Keener: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. [Tony looks around at the remains]\
\
Tony Stark: Six people died, right?\
\
Harley Keener: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: Including Chad Davis?\
\
Harley Keener: Yeah. [Tony keeps looking around at the remains of the explosion site]\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. [he sits next to Harley] Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.\
\
Harley Keener: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.\
\
Tony Stark: Do you buy that?\
\
Harley Keener: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?\
\
Tony Stark: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.\
\
Harley Keener: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?\
\
Tony Stark: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.\
\
Harley Keener: Are they coming back? The aliens?\
\
Tony Stark: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?\
\
Harley Keener: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?\
\
Harley Keener: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?\
\
Tony Stark: Nope.\
\
Harley Keener: Do you need to be on it?\
\
Tony Stark: Probably.\
\
Harley Keener: Do you have PTSD?\
\
Tony Stark: I don't think so.\
\
Harley Keener: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?\
\
Tony Stark: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! [Tony, looking agitated, suddenly rises] Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?\
\
Harley Keener: What did I say? [Tony starts running off and Harley runs after him] Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. [Tony stops running and Harley catches up with him] What the hell was that? [Tony holds his face in his hands for a moment and then throws some snow at Harley]\
\
Tony Stark: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?\
\
Harley Keener: Where she always is.\
\
Tony Stark: See, now you're being helpful. [later we see Tony walking towards a bar and he bumps into a woman] Sorry. [the woman drops something] Lady, this uh... [he picks up the item and hands it back to the woman]\
\
Brandt: Thank you. [Tony notices the woman has burn marks on one side of her face]\
\
Tony Stark: Nice haircut, suits you.\
\
Brandt: Nice watch.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, limited edition.\
\
Brandt: Oh, I don't doubt it. [there's a moment's pause] Well, have a good evening. [the woman turns and walks off] [Tony enters the bar and walks up to Mrs. Davis, who's sat at table drinking alone]\
\
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?\
\
Mrs. Davis: Free country.\
\
Tony Stark: It sure is. [Tony sits next to her, Mrs. Davis looks at Tony for a moment]\
\
Mrs. Davis: Alright. Where'd you like to start?\
\
Tony Stark: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.\
\
Mrs. Davis: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. [she drops the file in front of him] Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. [Tony opens the file]\
\
Tony Stark: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?\
\
Mrs. Davis: Yeah. [Tony looks at the file again and notices a photo of Taggart next to the photo of Chad]\
\
Tony Stark: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.\
\
Mrs. Davis: What?\
\
Tony Stark: As a weapon.\
\
Mrs. Davis: You're not the person who called me after all, are you? [suddenly a cell phone is slammed on their table]\
\
Brandt: Actually, I am. [Tony looks up and it's the woman he bumped into outsid the bar] [suddenly Brandt grabs hold of Tony's arm and twists it, slamming his head onto the table, Tony manages to quickly grab hold of Chad's dog tags that were on the table]\
\
Rose Hills Sheriff: Hey, hey, hey! What's all this about? What the hell's going on here?\
\
Brandt: It's called an arrest. [she pushes Tony to the ground and steps towards the Sheriff] Sheriff, is it?\
\
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yes ma'am, it is. And you are?\
\
Brandt: Homeland Security. [she holds up her badge] We good here?\
\
Rose Hills Sheriff: No, we're not good. I need a little more information than that.\
\
Brandt: Well, I think it's a little above your pay grade, Sheriff.\
\
Rose Hills Sheriff: Yeah, well, why don't you get on the horn to Nashville and uh...upgrade me? [Tony gestures to Mrs. Davis to hide the file, she pushes it under the bar]\
\
Brandt: Alright, you know what? I was hoping to do this the smart way, but uh...the fun way's always good. [Tony notices her hand turning red hot, burning the badge in her hand]\
\
Rose Hills Sheriff: Deputy, get this woman and... [suddenly Brandt shoves the hot badge into the Sheriff's face, she takes his gun and shoots him, Tony runs out of the bar and Brandt follows him, he turns to her]\
\
Tony Stark: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. [as Tony turns to run again he sees Savin getting out of a car and walk towards him, as Savin gets his gun out to shoot at him, Tony runs off and Harley throws something at Savin to make him miss Tony, Tony stops behind a car and sees a man hiding low on the ground] Crazy, huh?\
\
Rose Hill Christmas Tree Shopper: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: Watch this. [Tony smashes into the window of a shop] [as Tony and Brandt are fighting in the shop, Tony starts a fire in shop] You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. [Tony puts Chad's dog tags into the microwave and he turns on the gas]\
\
Brandt: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?\
\
Tony Stark: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. [Tony quickly leaves through the back door, as the dog tags heat up in the microwave they start sparking up fire, Brandt realizes the gas has been left on and suddenly the shop explodes killing Brandt] [Tony stumbles out of the shop as people run past. A watertank falls down and traps Tony's leg. He finds that Savin has grabbed Harley]\
\
Harley Keener: Let me go! [Savin mocks Harley]\
\
Savin: Help me! Help me! [as Tony's leg is trapped under some rubble, Savin sits in front of him with Harley sat on his lap] Hey kid, what would you like for Christmas?\
\
Harley Keener: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry!\
\
Savin: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, "I want my god damn file."\
\
Tony Stark: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. [Harley uses the gadget Tony gave him earlier and runs away] Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. [Tony brings up his hand and reveals his Iron Man suit hand. He fires at Savin and sends him flying backwards. Tony makes his way out of the rubble before leaving.]\
\
Harley Keener: You're welcome\
\
Tony Stark: For what? Did I miss something?\
\
Harley Keener: Me saving your life\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.\
\
Harley Keener: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.\
\
Tony Stark: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. [Tony gets in his car] I'm sorry, kid, you did good.\
\
Harley Keener: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?\
\
Tony Stark: Yep [A beat] Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?\
\
Harley Keener: [Childishly] I'm cold.\
\
Tony Stark: [Mocking him] I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. [Tony drives away]\
\
Harley Keener: It was worth a shot.\
\
[Savin wakes up, coughing and healed from Extremis. His face glows red.] [During an advert, the Mandarin takes over the satellite.]\
\
Government Employee: Mr Vice President, I think you should see this.\
\
Vice President: Oh god, not again. Is the President getting this?\
\
[On a plane, the President looks at a TV is shock.]\
\
The Mandarin: Mr President. Only two lessons remain and I intend to finish this before Christmas morning. Meet Thomas Richards. [The screen zooms out to show a man lying on the floor while Mandarin points a gun at him] Good strong name. Good strong job. Thomas, here, is an accountant for the Roxxon Oil Corporation. [Thomas sobs] But I'm sure he's a really good guy. I'm going to shoot him in the head, live on your television in 30 seconds.\
\
Thomas Richards: No!\
\
The Mandarin: The number for this telephone is in your cell phone. Exciting, isn't it, imagining how it got there? America, if your president calls me in the next half-minute, Tom lives. Go!\
\
Government Official #1: How did he hack my phone?\
\
Government Official #2: We can't allow terrorists to dictate...\
\
President Ellis: I have to make this call.\
\
Government Official #2: I'd strongly advise against that.\
\
President Ellis: This is the right thing to do. [The phone rings but Mandarin doesn't answer. He waits for a few seconds before firing the gun.]\
\
The Mandarin: There's just one lesson left, President Ellis. So run away, hide, kiss your children goodbye. Because nothing, not your army, not your red, white and blue attack dog, can save you. I'll see you soon.\
\
President Ellis: Tell Rhodes, find this lunatic right now.\
\
Military Aide: Sir, we tracked the broadcast signal. We have a possible point of origin in Pakistan and the Patriot is ready to strike.\
\
President Ellis: Right now.\
\
Military Aide: Yes, sir.\
\
(Tony Stark is reading over some files in a car. He sighs.)\
\
Tony Stark: Man. Happy, Happy, Happy-\
\
(Rhodey, suited in his Iron Patriot armor, kicks down a door & marches forwards.)\
\
Rhodey: Don't move! (His phone rings.) Uh... Hang on a second. Hello?\
\
Tony Stark: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?\
\
Tony Stark: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?\
\
Rhodey: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?\
\
Tony Stark: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.\
\
Rhodey: It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."\
\
Tony Stark: And password, please.\
\
Rhodey: Well, look, I gotta change it every time you hack in, Tony.\
\
Tony Stark: It's not the '80s, nobody says "hack" any more. Give me your login. (Rhodey sighs.)\
\
Rhodey: "WAR MACHINE ROX" with an "X," all caps.\
\
Tony Stark: (He's laughing.) That is so much better than "lron Patriot."\
\
EMCEE: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?\
\
Elk Ridge: Well, David...\
\
Crew: Do not erase a programme from my DVR unless you are 100% sure...\
\
EMCEE: One more time! Ms Elk Ridge, everybody! All right.\
\
Cameraman: Because you erase my shows!\
\
Tony Stark: That ain't gonna cut it.\
\
Cameraman: We talked about this. Excuse me, sir. I don't know who... (Tony turns around.)\
\
Tony Stark: Shh.\
\
Cameraman: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.\
\
Tony Stark: Shh. Keep it down.\
\
Cameraman: Tony Stark is in my van!\
\
Tony Stark: No, he's not.\
\
Cameraman: I knew you were still alive!\
\
Tony Stark: Come on in. Close the door. (The cameraman gets in the van & closes the door.) Shh...\
\
Cameraman: Oh, wow. Can I just say, sir...\
\
Tony Stark: Yep.\
\
Cameraman: I am your biggest fan.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?\
\
Cameraman: No, no, no. Just us.\
\
Tony Stark: Great. What's your name?\
\
Cameraman: Gary\
\
Tony Stark: Gary?\
\
Gary: Oh, wow.\
\
Tony Stark: Right there is fine.\
\
Gary: Okay.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.\
\
Gary: Oh, good. Can I just say?\
\
Tony Stark: What do you want?\
\
Gary: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...\
\
Tony Stark: It's fine.\
\
Gary: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.\
\
Tony Stark: Right.\
\
Gary: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!\
\
Tony Stark: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?\
\
Gary: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...\
\
Tony Stark: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.\
\
Gary: Got it.\
\
Tony Stark: All right? It's a mission.\
\
Gary: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: Tony needs Gary.\
\
Gary: And Gary needs Tony.\
\
Tony Stark: Be quiet about it. Go.\
\
Gary: Yeah.\
\
(Tony types on the keyboard & accesses the files he needs. A video starts playing.)\
\
Aldrich Killian: What would you regard as the defining moment of your life?\
\
Chad Davis: Well, uh, I think that would be the day I decided not to let my injury beat me. (Tony types again and another video shows up.)\
\
Aldrich Killian: Will you please state your name for the camera?\
\
Brandt: Ellen Brandt.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Okay. So, the injections are administered periodically. Addiction will not be tolerated. And those who cannot regulate will be out from the programme. (More typing, another video.) Once misfits, cripples... You are the next iteration of human evolution. Everybody, before we start... I promise you, looking back at your life, there will be nothing as bitter as the memory of that glorious risk you prudently elected to forego. Today is your glory- Let's begin. (Brandt's missing arm grows back as she glows red. The other volunteers glow red & scream too.) We gotta get out of here! We gotta get out of here! Get her out! Get them out of here! (One of the volunteers exploads.)\
\
Tony Stark: (He's muttering.) A bomb is not a bomb when it's a misfire. The stuff doesn't always work. Right, pal? It's faulty, but you found a buyer, didn't you? Sold it to the Mandarin. Got you, pal.\
\
(Pepper and Maya are in a bedroom talking.)\
\
Maya Hansen: What happened? Fun fact. Before he built rockets for the Nazis, the idealistic Wernher von Braun dreamed of space travel. He stargazed. Do you know what he said when the first V-2 hit London? "The rocket performed perfectly. It just landed on the wrong planet." See, we all begin wide-eyed. Pure science. And then the ego steps in, the obsession. And you look up, you're a long way from shore.\
\
Pepper Potts: You can't be too hard on yourself, Maya. I mean, you gave your research to a think tank.\
\
Maya Hansen: Yeah, but Killian built that think tank on military contracts.\
\
Pepper Potts: That's exactly what we used to do. So, don't judge yourself.\
\
Maya Hansen: Thank you, Pepper. I really appreciate that. (Someone knocks on the door & Pepper looks over. She gets up & opens the door. Room service pushes in a tray of food but Killain appears & snaps his neck. Pepper gasps.)\
\
Pepper Potts: Maya, run! [Killian grabs Pepper by the arm, spins her around and slams her against the wall, holding her by the neck.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Hi, Pepper. (To Maya) So, you want to tell me why you were at Stark's mansion last night?\
\
Maya Hansen: I'm trying to fix this thing. I didn't know you and the master were gonna blow the place up.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Oh, I see. So, you were trying to save Stark when he threatened us?\
\
Maya Hansen: I've told you, Killian, we can use him.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Pepper. Pepper. Pepper.\
\
Maya Hansen: Look, if we want to launch product next year, I need Stark. He just lacked a decent incentive. Now, he has one.\
\
[Rhodey flies across the sky in his Iron Patriot armor.]\
\
Man: [On radio] This is support team Blue-Zero. Sending coordinates for a suspected Mandarin broadcast point of origin.\
\
Rhodey: Copy. [Repulsor firing, people shrieking] Nobody move. [Women exclaiming in fear] Oh. Support Blue-Zero, unless the Mandarin's next attack on the U.S. involves cheaply-made sportswear, I think you messed up again. Yes, you're free, uh, if you weren't before. It's... Of course. Yes, ma'am. Iron Patriot on the job. Happy to help. No need to thank me, ma'am. It's my pleasure. [One of the women shakes Rhodey's hand and her hand glows red. Rhodey falls backwards, grunting.]\
\
Woman: Savin? I've acquired the Patriot armour.\
\
Rhodey: If you want this suit, you're going to have to pry my cold dead body out of it.\
\
Woman: That's the plan, Colonel.\
\
Tony Stark: Harley, tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.\
\
Harley Keener: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?\
\
Tony Stark: How much have you had?\
\
Harley Keener: Two or three bowls.\
\
Tony Stark: Can you still see straight?\
\
Harley Keener: Sort of.\
\
Tony Stark: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?\
\
JARVIS: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.\
\
Tony Stark: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?\
\
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.\
\
Harley Keener: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?\
\
Harley Keener: Uh, it's not charging. [Tony pulls over to the side of the road, heavy breathing]\
\
JARVIS: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.\
\
Tony Stark: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... [Breathing heavily] Oh, God, not again.\
\
Harley Keener: Tony? [Tony gets out of the car] Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.\
\
Tony Stark: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.\
\
Harley Keener: Okay, um, uh...\
\
Tony Stark: [Panting] God, what am I gonna do?\
\
Harley Keener: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?\
\
Tony Stark: Right.\
\
Harley Keener: You said so.\
\
Tony Stark: Yes, I did.\
\
Harley Keener: Why don't you just build something?\
\
Tony Stark: Okay. Thanks, kid. [He gets back in the car.] [Cut to Tony in a shop buying supplies.] [Cut to Tony building something.] [Cut to Miama, Florida. Tony climbs a wall and begins fighting guards. He makes his way into the house and finds a woman lying on a table.] [Cut to a different woman lying on a sofa with a man sitting at a desk.]\
\
Woman: Why is it so hot in here? I told you to put it at 68.\
\
Man: [Scoffs] My fault again. Let me tell you something, sweetheart. I am not your personal air con... [Tony puts a gloved hand on his head, electrocuting him. He gets the gun and leaves the room. He makes his way to the bedroom and pulls the duvet off the bed, revealling two girls. Tony sushes them and the toilet flushes.]\
\
The Mandarin: Well, I wouldn't go in there for 20 minutes. [He laughs] Now, which one of you is Vanessa?\
\
Vanessa: That's me.\
\
The Mandarin: Ah! Nessie. Did you know that fortune cookies aren't even Chinese?\
\
Vanessa: There's some guy over here.\
\
The Mandarin: They're made by Americans, based on a Japanese recipe.\
\
Tony Stark: Hey! [Mandarin raises his hands]\
\
The Mandarin: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.\
\
Tony Stark: Don't move.\
\
The Mandarin: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.\
\
Tony Stark: What?\
\
The Mandarin: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?\
\
Tony Stark: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?\
\
The Mandarin: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.\
\
Tony Stark: What do you mean?\
\
The Mandarin: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.\
\
Tony Stark: It is?\
\
The Mandarin: It's complicated.\
\
Tony Stark: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. [Door closes. Gunshot. Women exclaim in fear]\
\
The Mandarin: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.\
\
Tony Stark: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?\
\
Trevor Slattery: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. [Tony points the gun at Trevor's face] Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.\
\
Tony Stark: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.\
\
Trevor Slattery: It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.\
\
Tony Stark: Then how did you get here, Trevor?\
\
Trevor Slattery: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.\
\
Tony Stark: Next?\
\
Trevor Slattery: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.\
\
Tony Stark: What did they say? They'd get you off them?\
\
Trevor Slattery: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. [Snoring]\
\
Tony Stark: Did you just nod off? Hey. [Tony kicks him]\
\
Trevor Slattery: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. [Mimic explosion]\
\
Tony Stark: "He"? Killian?\
\
Trevor Slattery: Killian.\
\
Tony Stark: He created you?\
\
Trevor Slattery: He created me.\
\
Tony Stark: Custom-made terror threat.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.\
\
Tony Stark: Your performance? Where people died?\
\
Trevor Slattery: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.\
\
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... [Savin hits Tony around the head, unconcious]\
\
Savin: Okay, Trevor, what did you tell him?\
\
Trevor Slattery: I didn't tell him anything.\
\
Savin: Nothing?\
\
Trevor Slattery: No.\
\
Savin: You should have pressed the panic button.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.\
\
Tony Stark: Ah... [Sighs] Okay.\
\
Maya Hansen: It's just like old times, huh?\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.\
\
Maya Hansen: It wasn't my idea.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay. So you took Killian's card.\
\
Maya Hansen: I took his money.\
\
Tony Stark: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.\
\
Maya Hansen: No.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
\
Maya Hansen: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah?\
\
Maya Hansen: [Sighs and walks towards him] A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.\
\
Tony Stark: [Shouting] I'm telling you it isn't. [Lowers voice to usual volume] I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.\
\
Maya Hansen: Then help me fix it. [She shows him the "You Know Who I Am" note he left in 1999.]\
\
Tony Stark: Did I do that?\
\
Maya Hansen: Yes.\
\
Tony Stark: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?\
\
Maya Hansen: You don't remember?\
\
Tony Stark: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.\
\
Aldrich Killian: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."\
\
Tony Stark: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?\
\
Aldrich Killian: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.\
\
Tony Stark: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.\
\
Aldrich Killian: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.\
\
Tony Stark: You're something else.\
\
Aldrich Killian: You have met him, I assume?\
\
Tony Stark: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.\
\
Aldrich Killian: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.\
\
Tony Stark: What's next for you in your world?\
\
Aldrich Killian: Well, I wanted to repay you the selfsame gift that you so graciously imparted to me. [Killian rolls three balls forwards and they stop, projecting an image of Pepper. She has Extremis.] Desperation. Now, this is live. I'm not sure if you can tell, but at this moment the body is trying to decide whether to accept Extremis or just give up. And if it gives up, I have to say, the detonation is quite spectacular. But until that point, it's really just a lot of pain. We haven't even talked salary yet. What kind of perk package are you thinking of?\
\
Maya Hansen: Let him go.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Hold on, hold on. Maya...\
\
Maya Hansen: I said, let him go.\
\
Aldrich Killian: What are you doing?\
\
Maya Hansen: 1200 CCs. A dose half of this size, I'm dead.\
\
Aldrich Killian: It's times like this my temper is tested somewhat. Maya, give me the injector.\
\
Maya Hansen: If I die, Killian, what happens to your soldiers? What happens to your product?\
\
Aldrich Killian: We're not doing this, okay?\
\
Maya Hansen: What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot? [He looks back at Tony and shoots Maya]\
\
Aldrich Killian: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.\
\
Tony Stark: You are a maniac.\
\
Aldrich Killian: No, I'm a visionary. But I do own a maniac. And he takes the stage tonight. [Killian leaves and talks to Savin] Once we get the Patriot installed, it will take me nine or 10 minutes for the takedown.\
\
Savin: Well, that's great, but the last time I looked there was somebody inside of it. [Whirring]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Afternoon, gentlemen. [Whirring ceases] Hello, Colonel. Step aside. [Killian places his hand on the suit and it blows orange.] Oh! We'll get you out of there. Don't worry.\
\
Savin: You'll damage the armour.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Yes, I will. But you can fix it, right? I'm gonna take the Chinook to base camp. And I want Potts with me.\
\
Savin: She's still in Phase Two.\
\
Aldrich Killian: You're not going deaf, are you?\
\
Tony Stark: [Watch beeping.] Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?\
\
Guard #1: 832 miles.\
\
Tony Stark: Very nice.\
\
Guard #1: I'm good like that. Can you, uh, stop that?\
\
Tony Stark: Break it, you bought it.\
\
Guard #2: I think I bought it.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, that wasn't mine to give away. That belongs to my friend's sister. And that's why I'm gonna kill you first.\
\
Guard #2: What are you gonna do to me?\
\
Tony Stark: You'll see.\
\
Guard #2: You're zip-tied to a bed. This. [Nothing happens.] That. [Nothing happens again]\
\
Alrich Killian: Are you coming out?\
\
Rhodey: [Panting and sweating] Do not open. Do not open. Don't open. Don't open. [Beeping.] All right. Let's go. [The suit opens, Rhodey jumps and punches Savin in the face, then kicks him. Killian glows red and breathes fire at Rhodey.] You... You breathe fire? Okay. [Savin knocks Rhodey unconcious.]\
\
Aldrich Killian: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.\
\
Tony Stark: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...\
\
Guard #2: How did we get this shift?\
\
Tony Stark: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!\
\
Guard #2: Wow. That was...\
\
Tony Stark: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.\
\
Guard #2: I am just beyond terrified.\
\
Tony Stark: Here it comes. Three, four...\
\
Guard #2: Shut up.\
\
Tony Stark: [Quickly] Five, four, three, two, one! [The Iron Man suit joins to his left arm] Told you. Where's the rest? [He blasts one of the men and unties himself. As they fight, the suit connects to his rigth leg and he kicks them] Where's the rest? [Meanwhile, Harley watches as the garage door shakes. He runs over and blows it open. The suit flies out.] [Repulsor powering up, gunfire, screaming.]\
\
Man: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. [Tony leaves.]\
\
Tony Stark: Ah! Better late than never. [He gets outside and catches the face mask.] Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.\
\
JARVIS: Oh, hello, sir.\
\
Guard: [Beeping, Rhodey wakes up.] All personnel, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound. Repeat, Stark is loose and somewhere in the compound.\
\
Tony Stark: Ah! Let's go! [Thrusters misfiring.] Aw, crap.\
\
Rhodey: Tony?\
\
Tony Stark: Rhodey, tell me that was you in the suit.\
\
Rhodey: No. You got yours'?\
\
Tony Stark: Uh... Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.\
\
Rhodey: You, you, you! Move! Get out!\
\
Tony Stark: [Girls whimpering] The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.\
\
Rhodey: What's this? I had winners. [Gunshots. Trevor wakes up and begins drinking beer again.]\
\
Tony Stark: What have you come as?\
\
Rhodey: You make a move, and I break your face.\
\
Tony Stark:I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.\
\
Rhodey: This is the Mandarin?\
\
Tony Stark:Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.\
\
Tony Stark:Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.\
\
Rhodey: You tell him where Pepper is and he'll stop doing it.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Doing what? Ow, I get it! Ow! That hurt. I get it! I get it! I don't know about any Pepper, but I know about the plan.\
\
Tony Stark: Spill.\
\
Rhodey: Do you know what they did to my suit?\
\
Tony Stark: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Woah! [Rhodey jumps.] Ole', ole', ole', ole'...\
\
Rhodey: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, a little bit.\
\
Tony Stark: So?\
\
Rhodey: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.\
\
Tony Stark: Right. [Beer opens] Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.\
\
Rhodey: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?\
\
Tony Stark: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.\
\
Vice President: Thanks. Hello?\
\
Tony Stark: Sir, this is Tony Stark.\
\
Vice President: Welcome back to the land of the living.\
\
Tony Stark: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.\
\
Vice President: Mr Stark, I'm about to eat honey-roast ham, surrounded by the Agency's finest. The president's safe on Air Force One with Colonel Rhodes. I think we're good, here.\
\
Rhodey: Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They're using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan horse. They're gonna take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.\
\
Vice President: Okay, I'm on it. I'll have security lock it down. If need be, they can have F-22s in the air in 30 seconds. Thank you, Colonel.\
\
Rhodey: Rhodes and Stark out.\
\
Man: Everything okay, sir?\
\
Vice President: Couldn't be better. (To his daughter) I love you, babe.\
\
[The Iron Patriot lands and walks towards President Ellis]\
\
President Ellis: Colonel Rhodes. [Salutes] Glad to see you could make it, son. I feel safer already.\
\
Rhodey: We gotta make a decision. We can either save the president, or Pepper. We can't do both.\
\
JARVIS: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.\
\
Tony Stark: And what about the suit I'm wearing?\
\
JARVIS: The armour is now at 92%.\
\
Tony Stark: That's going to have to do.\
\
[The Iron Patient's arm opens and the suit wearer puts their hand against the door handle on a plane, burning it.]\
\
Military Aide: Everything all right, Colonel? [Iron Patriot kills the aide and people begin shooting at him. He kills everyone beside the President. The helmet lifts up to reveal Savin.\
\
Savin: It is an honour, Mr President.\
\
President Ellis: If you're gonna do it, do it!\
\
Savin: Whoa! Cool your boots, sir. That's not how the Mandarin works.\
\
Officer: Sir, Air Force One has been compromised. Internal shots, temperature spikes.\
\
Officer #2: Get me eyes on it now.\
\
Officer: Image coming through now, sir.\
\
Officer #2: Was that Rhodes?\
\
Man: Is anyone there?\
\
Woman: Let us out! [Tony attacks Savin and pins him against the wall.]\
\
Tony Stark: The President. Now.\
\
Savin: He's not here. [Savin burns the Iron Man suit's arm. Electrical crackling, mechanisms grinding, soft groaning.] Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. [A door blasts open on the plane, people screaming, metal creaking, more screaming. Tony blasts Savin in the chest.]\
\
Tony Stark: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. [Savin falls to the ground.] How many in the air?\
\
JARVIS: Thirteen, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: How many can I carry?\
\
JARVIS: Four, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?\
\
Heather: [Screaming] Oh, God! No! No!\
\
Tony Stark: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?\
\
Heather: What? Oh!\
\
Tony Stark: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.\
\
JARVIS: 18,000 feet.\
\
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.\
\
JARVIS: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.\
\
Tony Stark: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!\
\
JARVIS: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. [Tony drops them all in the water from a few feet above.]\
\
Man: We made it!\
\
Tony Stark: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... [The Iron Man suit flies into a truck and the suit disassembles. He sighs.] That came out of nowhere. Wow [We now see Tony on the boat, where he was controlling the suit.]\
\
Rhodey: Give me some good news, man.\
\
Tony Stark: I think they all made it.\
\
Rhodey: Oh, thank God.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, but I missed the president.\
\
Rhodey: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?\
\
Tony Stark: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?\
\
JARVIS: The House Party Protocol, sir?\
\
Tony Stark: Correct.\
\
Aldrich Killian: [Pepper wakes up and gasps.] Hi.\
\
Pepper Potts: [Breathing heavily.] You think he's gonna help you? He won't.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Having you here is not just to motivate Tony Stark. It's, um... Well, it's actually more embarrassing than that. You're here as my, um...\
\
Pepper Potts: Trophy\
\
Aldrich Killian: [Chuckles.] Mmm. [Iron Patriot walks in and Pepper gasps.] Good evening, sir. [The armor opens and the President falls out.] Welcome aboard, Mr President. Ever hear of an elephant graveyard? Well, two years ago, the elephant in the room was this scow.\
\
President Ellis: This is the Roxxon Norco.\
\
Aldrich Killian:And, of course, you'll remember that when she spilled a million gallons of crude off Pensacola, thanks to you, not one fat cat saw a day in court.\
\
President Ellis: What do you want from me?\
\
Aldrich Killian: Uh, nothing, sir. I just needed a reason to kill you that would play well on TV. You see, I've moved on. I found myself a new political patron, and this time tomorrow, he'll have your job. String him up.\
\
President Ellis: Hey!\
\
Rhodey: [Climbs on to the boat.] Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?\
\
Tony Stark: I hope not.\
\
Rhodey: Oh, my God. [Sighs] He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.\
\
Tony Stark: Viking funeral. Public execution.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, death by oil.\
\
Announcer: (On PA) Broadcast will commence shortly. Take final positions.\
\
Aldrich Killian: Okay. That's good. Now give me cameras A through E and we'll do a full tech rehearsal. (Technician typing)\
\
Rhodey: ls your gun up?\
\
Tony Stark: Yep. What do I do?\
\
Rhodey: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.\
\
Tony Stark: Six, high, back. Alright. [Gunfire, bullets ricocheting] You see that? Nailed it.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, you really killed the glass.\
\
Tony Stark: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance. [Rhodey fires a bullet and hits the bulb.]\
\
Announcer: [On PA] All personnel, we have hostiles on east unit 12.\
\
Man: Over there!\
\
Announcer: [On PA] I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.\
\
Tony Stark: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?\
\
Rhodey: They're not universal, Tony.\
\
Tony Stark: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.\
\
Rhodey: Okay\
\
Tony Stark: Give me one of yours.\
\
Rhodey: I don't have one that fits that gun.\
\
Tony Stark: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?\
\
Rhodey: What'd you see?\
\
Tony Stark: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. [Clears throat] Three guys, one girl, all armed.\
\
Rhodey: God, I would kill for some armour right now.\
\
Tony Stark: You're right. We need backup.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, a bunch.\
\
Tony Stark: You know what? [He nods at something in the distance, whooshing]\
\
Rhodey: Is that...?\
\
Tony Stark: Yep.\
\
Rhodey: Are those...?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. [Dozens of Iron Man suits fly over.] Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.\
\
JARVIS: [Through armors] Yes, sir.\
\
Tony Stark: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.\
\
JARVIS: Gentlemen. [Grunting, screaming.]\
\
Tony Stark: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. [Mechanisms whirring.]\
\
Rhodey: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?\
\
Tony Stark: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? [Tony suits up.] Nice timing.\
\
Rhodey: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?\
\
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.\
\
Rhodey: What does that mean?\
\
Tony Stark: I got you covered.\
\
JARVIS: Good evening, Colonel. Can I give you a lift?\
\
Rhodey: Very funny.\
\
JARVIS: Sir, I've located Ms Potts.\
\
Tony Stark: About time.\
\
Pepper Potts: [Gasps, panting.] Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.\
\
Tony Stark: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?\
\
Pepper Potts: You're such a jerk.\
\
Tony Stark: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. [Metal creaking, Pepper sobbing.] Come on. A little more, baby. [Pepper straining, Tony grunting. Killian shoves his hand on Tony's suit, burning it.]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Is this guy bothering you? Don't get up. Ooh. Is it hot in there? [Sizzling.] Stuck? Do you feel a little stuck? Like a little turtle, cooking in his little turtle suit.\
\
Pepper Potts: Tony.\
\
Aldrich Killian: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. [Tony cuts off Killian's arm, it burns through the floor and Pepper falls down.]\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, you take a minute. [Groaning, sizzling, metal creaking, yelling, grunts, Pepper whimpers.] Jarvis, give me a suit right now! [The suit he called gets destroyed.] Oh, come on!\
\
Rhodey: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. [Gunfire] Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.\
\
Tony Stark: Nice work.\
\
Rhodey: Ready, sir?\
\
President Ellis: What do you mean "ready"? [Rhodey blasts off and the President screams.]\
\
Tony Stark: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! [Pepper falls to the ground and into the flames below.]\
\
Aldrich Killian: A shame. I would've caught her. [Tony and Killian run towards each other. Killian jumps up to attack, Tony slides under and armors up. Repulsors firing, flesh burning, both grunting.]\
\
Tony Stark: Eject. [More repulsors firing.]\
\
Aldrich Killian: Well, here we are on the roof. [Killian slices the suit in half.]\
\
JARVIS: Mark 42, inbound.\
\
Tony Stark: I'll be damned. The prodigal son returns. [The suit flies to Tony, hits a piece of metal and falls apart. Rolls his eyes.] Whatever.\
\
Aldrich Killian: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. [Tony motions to the suit and it flies on to Killian.] Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.\
\
Aldrich Killian: [Muffled screaming.] No! [He walks towards Tony, his flesh held together by flames.] No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am the Mandarin! [Someone hits Killian and he flies to the side. It's Pepper. Heavy breathing.]\
\
Tony Stark: I got nothing. [Repulsor powering up.] Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? [Pepper runs towards Tony, flips in the air, punches through the Iron Man suit and destroys it. She uses the suit to blow up Killian.] Honey?\
\
Pepper Potts: Oh, my God. That was really violent.\
\
Tony Stark: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...\
\
Pepper Potts: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?\
\
Tony Stark: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.\
\
Pepper Potts: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?\
\
Tony Stark: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.\
\
Pepper Potts: No, don't touch me.\
\
Tony Stark: Don't worry about it.\
\
Pepper Potts: No, I'm gonna burn you.\
\
Tony Stark: No, you're not. Not hot.\
\
Pepper Potts: Am I gonna be okay?\
\
Tony Stark: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.\
\
Pepper Potts: And all your distractions?\
\
Tony Stark: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.\
\
JARVIS: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?\
\
Tony Stark: You know what to do.\
\
JARVIS: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?\
\
Tony Stark: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. [Pepper and Tony hug as the Iron Man suits blow up.] Okay, so far? Do you like it?\
\
Pepper Potts: It'll do.\
\
Tony Stark (V.O): And so, as Christmas morning began, my journey had reached its end. You start with something pure, something exciting. Then, come the mistakes. The compromises. We create our own demons.\
\
Trevor Slattery: Oh! Great to see you! Oh, bloody hell!\
\
Tony Stark (V.O): But then I thought to myself, "Why stop there?" Of course, there are people who say progress is dangerous, but I'll bet none of those idiots ever had to live with a chestful of shrapnel. And now, neither will I. Let me tell you,[Metal clinking.] that was the best sleep I'd had in years.\
\
Nurse: [Happy wakes up, gasping and coughing.] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.\
\
Happy Hogan: [Weak] No, look.\
\
Tony Stark (V.O): [Throws Arc Reactor into the ocean.] So, if I were to wrap this up, tie it with a bow, or whatever... I guess I'd say my armor, it was never a distraction, or a hobby. It was a cocoon. And now, I'm a changed man. You can take away my house, all my tricks and toys. One thing you can't take away... I am Iron Man. [Thrilling music playing, credit scene.] You know, and thank you by the way. For listening. Plus, something about just getting it off my chest, and putting it out there in the atmosphere, instead of holding this in... I mean, this is what gets people sick, you know. Wow, I had no idea you were such a good listener.\
\
Tony Stark: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. [The camera zooms out to show Bruce Banner, asleep.] And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... [Tony stops and looks over as Bruce rubs his eyes.] Are you with me?\
\
Bruce Banner: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...\
\
Tony Stark: Are you actively napping?\
\
Bruce Banner: [Stammering] I was... I... I drifted.\
\
Tony Stark: Where did I lose you?\
\
Bruce Banner: Elevator in Switzerland.\
\
Tony Stark: So, you heard none of it?\
\
Bruce Banner: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.\
\
Tony Stark: So?\
\
Bruce Banner: I don't have the...\
\
Tony Stark: What? The time?\
\
Bruce Banner: Temperament.\
\
Tony Stark: You know what? Now that I think about it... Oh! God, my original wound. 1983, all right?\
\
Bruce Banner: Yes.\
\
Tony Stark: I'm 14 years old, I still have a nanny. That was weird.\
\
Tony (V.O.): Been a while since I was up here in front of you. Maybe I\'92ll do us all a favour and just stick to the cards. There\'92s been some speculation that I was somehow involved in the events that occurred on the freeway and on the rooftop\'85\
Christine Everhart (V.O.): Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?\
Tony (V.O.): Yes\
MOSCOW\
Christine (V.O.): And this mysterious bodyguard was somehow equipped with an undisclosed Stark high-tech powered battle\'85\
Tony (V.O.): I know that it\'92s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I\'92m a superhero.\
Switch to view of a TV\
Tony (on TV): I mean, let\'92s face it, I\'92m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I\'92ve made, largely public. The truth is\'85 I am Iron Man.\
Anton Vanko [Russian]: Ivan. Vanya. That should be you.\
Ivan Vanko [Russian]: Don\'92t listen to that crap\
Anton Vanko [Russian]: I\'92m sorry. All I can give you is my knowledge.\
(Anton coughs and dies. Ivan is naturally distraught. Takes a swig of vodka. Pulls out blueprints for an arc reactor. Engineering montage as opening credits roll.)\
\
IRON MAN 2\
\
Man (V.O): 270 at 30 knots. Holding steady at 15000 feet. You are clear for exfiltration over the drop zone\
(ACDC\'92s Shoot to Thrill starts to play)\

(And a picture of Iron Man with an opening door in the bottom of an aeroplane. And he jumps out said aeroplane, landing on a stage. All very ostentatious. Dancing girls. Fireworks.)\
STARK EXPO \'96 FLUSHING, NEW YORK.\
(Dismantling Iron Man suit.)\
Pretty much everyone in the crowd: Tony! Tony! Tony! Tony!\
Tony: It\'92s good to be back. You missed me?\
Man in crowd: Blow something up!\
Tony: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I\'92m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I\'92m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I\'92m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven\'92t come across anyone who\'92s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.\
Woman in crowd: I love you Tony!\
Tony: Please, it\'92s not about me. [People still cheering Tony] It\'92s not about you. It\'92s not even about us. It\'92s about legacy. It\'92s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that\'92s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It\'92s not about us. Therefore, what I\'92m saying, if I\'92m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. [Big cheer from crowd.] And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it\'92s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.\
Howard Stark (on a screen, courtesy of a video recording): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. So, from all of us here at Stark Industries, I would like to personally introduce you to the City of the Future. Technology holds infinite possibilities for mankind, [Tony is off the stage, doing something. Blood toxicity test. Gives a reading of 19%. Not good] and will one day rid society of all its ills. Soon technology will affect the way you live your life every day. No more tedious work, leaving more time for leisure activities and enjoying the sweet life. The Stark Expo. Welcome.\
\
[Video ends. Cut to news feed of reporter outside.]\
Reporter: We are coming to you live from the kickoff at the Stark Expo, where Tony Stark has just walked offstage. Don\'92t worry if you can\'92t make it down here tonight because this Expo goes on all year long. And I\'92m gonna be here checking out all the attractions and the pavilions and inventions from all around the world.\
\
Happy Hogan: Make sure you join me\'85\
\
Tony: All right, it\'92s a zoo out there, watch out.\
\
Happy: Open up, let\'92s go.\
\
[Image is Tony trying to pass through the crowd, from Tony\'92s perspective.]\
\
Tony: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.\
\
People: Tony, Tony\
\
Tony: Hey, hey.\
\
Woman: Call me.\
\
Happy: Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on, come on.\
\
Tony: [signing a picture of Iron Man] Hello. It would be a pleasure.\
\
Happy: Okay\
\
Tony: [what would be ruffling the hair of a small boy if said small boy were not wearing an Iron Man helmet making hair unreachable] See you buddy\
\
Happy: This is Larry.\
\
Tony: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.\
\
Larry: Call me. Call me.\
\
Happy: Larry King.\
\
Tony: Larry! Larry. Yes, my people, my people.\
\
Happy: [Scene shows them finally at the door] Come on, Tony. There we go.\
\
Tony: Very mellow.\
\
Happy: That wasn\'92t so bad.\
\
Tony: No, it was perfect.\
\
Happy: Look what we got here, the new model.\
\
Tony: Hey, does she come with the car?\
\
Happy: I certainly hope so. Hi.\
\
Tony: Hi. And you are?\
\
Woman: Marshal.\
\
Tony: Irish. I like it.\
\
Marshal: Pleased to meet you Tony.\
\
Tony: I\'92m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?\
\
Marshal: Bedford.\
\
Tony: What are you doing here?\
\
Marshal: Looking for you.\
\
Tony: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?\
\
Marshal: Serving subpoenas. [Hands him a letter. Tony doesn\'92t take it]\
\
Tony: Yikes.\
\
Happy: [Reaching over and taking the letter] He doesn\'92t like to be handed things.\
\
Tony: Yeah, I have a peeve.\
\
Marshal: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.\
\
Tony: Can I see a badge?\
\
Marshal: You wanna see the badge?\
\
Happy: He likes the badge.\
\
Marshal: [showing him her badge.] You still like it?\
\
Tony: Yep. [Starts engine] How far are we from D.C.?\
\
Happy: D.C.? 250 miles.\
\
[Drive off. Image slides over, like when you used to make Powerpoints with all the transitions. It now shows Washing D.C. You can tell because words appear saying\'85]\
\
WASHINGTON D.C.\
\
Senator Stern: Mr Stark, could we pick up now where we left off? Mr Stark. Please.\
\
Tony: [turns around from where he was trying to talk to Pepper who looks like she was trying to tell him off.] Yes dear?\
\
Senator Stern: Can I have your attention?\
\
Tony: Absolutely.\
\
Stern: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?\
\
Tony: I do not.\
\
Stern: You do not?\
\
Tony: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.\
\
Stern: The Iron Man weapon.\
\
Tony: My device does not fit that description.\
\
Stern: Well\'85 How would you describe it?\
\
Tony: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.\
\
Stern: As?\
\
Tony: It\'92s a high-tech prosthesis. That is\'85 That is\'85 That\'92s actually the most apt description I can make of it.\
\
Stern: It\'92s a weapon. It\'92s a weapon, Mr Stark.\
\
Tony: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen\'85\
\
Stern: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.\
\
Tony: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you\'92re in. You can\'92t have it.\
\
Stern: Look, I\'92m no expert\'85\
\
Tony: In prostitution? Of course not. You\'92re a senator. Come on.\
\
[People laugh. He waves. Pepper does not look impressed at all. He mouths \'93no?\'94 and she shakes her head.]\
\
Stern: I\'92m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I\'92d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.\
\
Tony: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.\
\
Justin Hammer: Absolutely. I\'92m no expert. I defer to you, Anthony. You\'92re the wonder boy. Senator, if I may. I may well not be an expert, but you know who was the expert? Your dad. Howard Stark. Really a father to us all, and to the military-industrial age. Let\'92s just be clear, he was no flower child. He was a lion. We all know why we\'92re here. In the last six months, Anthony Stark has created a sword with untold possibilities. And yet, he insists it\'92s a shield. He asks us to trust him as we cower behind it. I wish I were comforted, Anthony, I really do. I\'92d love to leave my door unlocked when I leave the house, but this ain\'92t Canada. You know, we live in a world of grave threats, threats that Mr Stark will not always be able to foresee. Thank you. God bless Iron Man. God bless America.\
\
Stern: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.\
\
Tony: Rhodey? What?\
\
[Rhodey walks in, Tony gets up to greet him] \\\
\
Tony: Hey, buddy. I didn\'92t expect to see you here.\
\
Rhodey: Look, it\'92s me, I\'92m here. Deal with it. Let\'92s move on.\
\
Tony: I just\'85\
\
Rhodey: Drop it.\
\
Tony: All right, I\'92ll drop it.\
\
Stern: I have before me a complete report on the Iron Man weapon, complied by Colonel Rhodes. And, Colonel, for the record, can you please read page 57, paragraph four?\
\
Rhodey: You\'92re requesting that I read specific selections from my report, Senator?\
\
Stern: Yes, sir.\
\
Rhodey: It was my understanding that I was going to be testifying in a much more comprehensive and detailed manner.\
\
Stern: I understand. A lot of things have changed today. So if you could just read\'85\
\
Rhodey: You do understand that reading a single paragraph out of context does not reflect the summery of my final\'85\
\
Stern: Just read it, Colonel. I do. Thank you.\
\
Rhodey: Very well. \'93As he does not operate within any definable branch of government, Iron Man presents a potential threat to the security of both the nation and to her interests.\'94 I did however, go on to summarise that the benefits of Iron Man far outweigh three liabilities and that it would be in our interest\'85\
\
Stern: That\'92s enough Colonel\
\
Rhodey: \'85to fold Mr Stark\'85\
\
Stern: That\'92s enough\
\
Rhodey: \'85into the existing chain of command, Senator.\
\
Tony: I\'92m not a joiner, but I\'92ll consider Secretary of Defence, if you ask nice.\
\
[Laughs from crowd.]\
\
Tony: We can amend the hours a little bit.\
\
Stern: I\'92d like to go on and show, if I may, the imagery that\'92s connected to your report.\
\
Rhodey: I believe it is somewhat premature to reveal these images to the general public at this time.\
\
Stern: With all due respect, Colonel, I understand. And if you could just narrate those for us, we\'92d be very grateful. Let\'92s have the images.\
\
Rhodey: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark\'92s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground\'85\
\
[Tony is doing something on a Stark device]\
\
Rhodey: \'85 indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.\
\
Tony: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. [Sets up his device to connect with the screen showing the pictures.] Boy, I\'92m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let\'92s see what\'92s really going on.\
\
Stern: What is he doing?\
\
Tony: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that\'92s North Korea. [Video of a suit. It falls over and clearly doesn\'92t work very well at all.]\
\
Stern: Can you turn that off? Take it off. [Justin Hammer stands up]\
\
Tony: Iran.\
\
[This suit can fly. For all of five seconds before crashing, judging by the smoke, probably on fire. Justin is by the screen, trying to find the off switch.]\
\
Tony: No grave threat here. Is that Justin Hammer? How did Hammer get in the game?\
\
[Yep, it\'92s a video of Justin Hammer. With a suit. Again that really doesn\'92t work.]\
\
Tony: Justin, you\'92re on TV. Focus up.\
\
TV Justin: Okay, give me a left twist. Left\'92s good. Turn to the right. Oh, shit. Oh, shit.\
\
[Language Justin]\
\
Tony: [Just as not-TV Justin finds the plug and unplugs the screen] Wow. Yeah, I\'92d say most countries, five, ten years away. Hammer Industries, twenty.\
\
Justin: I\'92d like to point out that that test pilot survived.\
\
Stern: I think we\'92re done is the point that he\'92s making. I don\'92t think there\'92s any reason\'85\
\
Tony: The point is, you\'92re welcome, I guess\
\
Stern: For what?\
\
Tony: Because I\'92m your nuclear deterrent. It\'92s working. We\'92re safe. America is secure. You want my property? You can\'92t have it. But I did you a big favour.\
\
[Stands up and turns around to face the crowd]\
\
Tony: I\'92ve successfully privatised world peace.\
\
[Both hands make peace signs and everyone stands up, all talking at once]\
\
Tony: What more do you want? For now! I tried to play ball with these ass-clowns.\
\
Stern: [beep] you, Mr Stark. [beep] you, buddy. We\'92re adjourned. We\'92re adjourned for today.\
\
Tony: [puts on sunglasses. Rhodey\'92s still sitting down and has the same look on his face as Pepper did. Basically, they\'92re both tired of Tony not taking serious things seriously] Okay.\
\
Stern: You\'92ve been a delight.\
\
[Kind of scene change. It\'92s now on a television on a Russian news channel with Russian dubbing. Because it\'92s a film where the selected language is English, we can still here the English clearer than the Russian. We\'92re back to Ivan.]\
\
Tony (on TV): My bond is with the people. And I will serve this great nation at the pleasure of myself. If there\'92s one thing I\'92ve proven it\'92s that you can count on me to pleasure myself.\
\
[Ivan is still working. There\'92s things going blue. It works. It\'92s not a full suit, but it does now look like he has whips made of lightning. Scene change. Tony\'92s house. He\'92s in his workshop. Pans in from across the ocean]\
\
MALIBU, CALIFORNIA\
\
Tony: Wake up, Daddy\'92s home.\
\
Jarvis (V.O., A.I): Welcome home, sir. Congratulations on the opening ceremonies. They were such a success, as was your Senate hearing. And may I say how refreshing it is to finally see you in a video with your clothing on, sir.\
\
[One of the robots is trying to make a smoothie. Without a blender lid]\
\
Tony: You!\
\
[You knocks over the blender. Well, he tried.]\
\
Tony: I swear to God I\'92ll dismantle you. I\'92ll soak your motherboard. I\'92ll turn you into a wine rack.\
\
[You looks down, sad.]\
\
Tony: How many ounce a day of this gobbledegook am I supposed to drink?\
\
Jarvis: We are up to 80 ounces a day to counteract the symptoms, sir.\
\
[Tony downs green liquid]\
\
Tony: Check palladium levels.\
\
[Using the same machine as before]\
\
Jarvis: Blood toxicity, 24%. It appears that the continued use of the Iron Man suit is accelerating your condition. Another core has been depleted.\
\
Tony: [Takes Arc Reactor out of chest. The core pops out, rusted and slightly smoking.] God, they\'92re running out quick.\
\
Jarvis: I have run simulations on every known element, and none can serve as a viable replacement for the palladium core.\
\
[Tony inputs a new core. It\'92s silver, giving a judgment of just how badly damaged the other one was. Replaces Arc Reactor in chest.]\
\
Jarvis: You are running out of both time and options. Unfortunately, the device that\'92s keeping you alive is also killing you.\
\
[Which we can see from the image of Tony\'92s chest on the computer screen. There\'92s blue lines all around the Arc Reactor. Camera angle shifts to focus on his actual chest.]\
\
Jarvis: Miss Potts is approaching. I recommend that you inform her\'85\
\
Tony: Mute.\
\
[Shirt back down, computers switched to screen saver, Pepper inputs a code and opens the door]\
\
Pepper: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?\
\
Tony: What?\
\
Pepper: What are you thinking?\
\
Tony: Hey, I\'92m thinking I\'92m busy. And you\'92re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don\'92t want to get sick.\
\
Pepper: Did you just donate\'85\
\
Tony: Keep your business.\
\
[Both walking around the room]\
\
Pepper: \'85our entire modern art collection to the\'85\
\
Tony: Boy Scouts of America.\
\
Pepper: \'85Boy Scouts of America?\
\
Tony: Yes. It is a worthwhile organisation. I didn\'92t physically check the crates but, basically, yes. And it\'92s not \'93our\'94 collection, it\'92s my collection. No offence.\
\
Pepper: No, you know what? I think I\'92m actually entitled to say \'93our\'94 collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.\
\
Tony: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.\
\
Pepper: You know, there\'92s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.\
\
Tony: [to another robot] Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport\'92s already machining that part.\
\
Pepper: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.\
\
Tony: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you\'92re feeling better. Is that okay?\
\
Pepper: That\'92s rude.\
\
Tony: There\'92s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It\'92s my primary point of concern. I don\'92t know why you\'92re\'85\
\
Pepper: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.\
\
Tony: [Picking up a painting. Of Iron Man] Wow. Look at that. That\'92s modern art. That\'92s going up.\
\
Pepper: You\'92ve got to be kidding.\
\
Tony: I\'92m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.\
\
Pepper: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?\
\
Tony: No. Our stocks have never been higher.\
\
Pepper: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.\
\
Tony: You are\'85 Well, if\'92s messy then let\'92s double back.\
\
Pepper: Let me give you an example.\
\
Tony: Let\'92s move onto another subject.\
\
Pepper: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.\
\
Tony: I\'92m not taking it down. I\'92m just replacing it with this.\
\
[Tony is now stood on a desk about to take down the Barnett Newman to put the Iron Man picture up].\
\
Tony: Let\'92s see what I can get going on here.\
\
Pepper: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.\
\
Tony: Yeah. Don\'92t say \'93wind farm.\'94 I\'92m already feeling gassy.\
\
Pepper: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll\'85\
\
Tony: Everything was my idea.\
\
Pepper: \'85and you won\'92t make a decision.\
\
Tony: I don\'92t care about the liberal agenda any more. It\'92s boring. Boring. I\'92m giving you a boring alert. [Jumps off desk] You do it.\
\
Pepper: I do what?\
\
Tony: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.\
\
Pepper: Yeah, I\'92m trying to run the company.\
\
Tony: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.\
\
Pepper: You will not give me the information\'85\
\
Tony: I\'92m not asking you to try\'85\
\
Pepper: \'85in order to\'85\
\
Tony: I\'92m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.\
\
Pepper: I am trying to do it.\
\
Tony: Pepper, you\'92re not listening to me!\
\
Pepper: No, you are not listening to me.\
\
Tony: I\'92m trying to make you CEO. Why won\'92t you let me?\
\
Pepper: Have you been drinking?\
\
Tony: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I\'92ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. [One of the robots brings him a tray which a bottle and glasses on it] Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it\'92s you. It\'92s always been you. [Pours champagne. Pepper sits down, shocked and confused]. I thought there\'92d be a legal issue, but actually I\'92m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. [Hands her a glass. She doesn\'92t take it.] Congratulations? Take it, just take it.\
\
Pepper: I don\'92t know what to think.\
\
Tony: Don\'92t think, drink. There you go. [They tap glasses and drink]\
\
[We\'92re back in Russia. A man hands Ivan a letter down a twitten, out of sight. It contains a fake passport and a ticket. Another scene change. Tony and Happy are boxing. Pepper walks in.]\
\
Pepper: The notary\'92s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?\
\
Tony: I\'92m on happy time. [Tony hits Happy in the face with his elbow] Sorry.\
\
Happy: What the hell was that?\
\
Tony: It\'92s called mixed martial arts. It\'92s been around for three weeks.\
\
Happy: It\'92s called dirty boxing, there\'92s nothing new about it\
\
Tony: All right, put them up. Come on. [The Notary walks in. Both Happy and Tony\'92s attention shifts to her]\
\
Pepper: I promise this is the only time I will ask you to sign over your company.\
\
Notary: I need you to initial each box.\
\
Happy: [Taps Tony on the back of the head with a light punch, not enough to hurt him] Lesson one. Never take your eye off\'85 [Tony kicks him and he goes crashing into the corner of the ring. Camera angle shifts to Pepper and the Notary and clangs are heard.]\
\
Tony: That\'92s it. I\'92m done. What\'92s your name, lady?\
\
Notary: Rushman. Natalie Rushman [So we shall now refer to the Notary as Natalie]\
\
Tony: Front and centre. Come into the church.\
\
Pepper: No. You\'92re seriously not gonna ask\'85\
\
Tony: If it pleases the court, which it does.\
\
Natalie: [To Pepper] It\'92s no problem.\
\
Pepper: [To Natalie] I\'92m sorry. He\'92s very eccentric.\
\
[Natalie enters ring. Tony swigs down more green liquid out of a bottle]\
\
Tony: Can you give her a lesson?\
\
Happy: No problem.\
\
Tony: [Steps out of ring and towards Pepper] Pepper.\
\
Pepper: What?\
\
Tony: [Sitting down next to Pepper] Who is she?\
\
Pepper: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.\
\
Tony: I need a new assistant, boss.\
\
Pepper: Yes, and I\'92ve got three excellent potential candidates. They\'92re lined up and ready to meet you.\
\
Tony: I don\'92t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it\'92s her.\
\
Pepper: No, it\'92s not.\
\
Happy: You ever boxed before?\
\
Natalie: I have, yes.\
\
Happy: What, like, the Tae Bo? Booty Boot Camp? Crunch? Something like that? [Natalie\'92s face shows brief annoyance at his statement before Tony distracts her]\
\
Tony: How do I spell your name, Natalie?\
\
Natalie: R-U-S-H-M-A-N.\
\
Pepper: What, are you gonna google her now?\
\
Tony: I thought I was ogling her. [Brings up Natalie\'92s file on table which doubles up as a computer. He has computers on everything.] Wow. Very, very impressive individual.\
\
Pepper: You\'92re so predictable, you know that?\
\
Tony: She\'92s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?\
\
Pepper: No one speaks Latin.\
\
Tony: No one speaks Latin\
\
Pepper: It\'92s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can\'92t speak Latin.\
\
Tony: Did you model in Tokyo? \'91Cause she modelled in Tokyo.\
\
Pepper: Well\'85\
\
Tony: I need her. She\'92s got everything that I need. [Camera is now on Natalie and Happy, Natalie looking over, hearing what Tony is saying]\
\
Happy: Rule number one, never take your eyes off your opponent. [He goes to take a swing, she grabs his hand and flips him over, legs over his head.]\
\
Pepper: Oh, my God! Happy.\
\
Tony: That\'92s what I\'92m talking about.\
\
Happy: I just slipped.\
\
Tony: You did?\
\
Happy: [Who looks a little like he\'92s in pain] Yeah.\
\
Tony: Looks like a TKO to me. [Rings the bell and Natalie leaves the ring]\
\
Natalie: Just\'85 I need your impression.\
\
Tony: You have a quiet reserve. I don\'92t know, you have an old soul.\
\
Natalie: I meant your fingerprint.\
\
Tony: Right.\
\
Pepper: So, how are we doing?\
\
Tony: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You\'92re the boss.\
\
Natalie: Will that be all, Mr Stark?\
\
Tony: No.\
\
Pepper: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. [She leaves. Tony turns to Pepper]\
\
Tony: I want one.\
\
Pepper: No.\
\
[News report is heard. In French. It\'92s about the Grand Prix.\
\
Tony, Pepper and Happy are seen leaving a car and walking into a building. Happy is carrying a red suitcase]\
\
Tony: You know, it\'92s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.\
\
Pepper: Go with it? Go with what?\
\
Natalie: Mr Stark?\
\
Tony: Hey.\
\
Natalie: Hello. How was your flight?\
\
Tony: It was excellent. Boy, it\'92s nice to see you.\
\
Natalie: We have one photographer from the ACM, if you don\'92t mind. Okay?\
\
Pepper: When did this happen?\
\
Tony: What? You made me do it.\
\
Pepper: I made you do what?\
\
Tony: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don\'92t flare your nostrils.\
\
Pepper: You are so predictable.\
\
Tony: That\'92s the amazing thing.\
\
Natalie: Right this way.\
\
Tony: You look fantastic.\
\
Natalie: Why, thank you very much.\
\
Tony: But that\'92s unprofessional. What\'92s on the docket?\
\
Natalie: You have a 9:30 dinner.\
\
Tony: Perfect. I\'92ll be there at 11:00.\
\
Natalie: Absolutely.\
\
Tony: Is this us?\
\
Natalie: It can be.\
\
Tony: Great. Make it us.\
\
Natalie: Okay.\
\
Pepper: Mr Musk. How are you?\
\
Mr Musk: Hi, Pepper. Congratulations on the promotion.\
\
Pepper: Thank you very much.\
\
Tony: Elon, how\'92s it going. Those Merlin engines are fantastic.\
\
Mr Musk: Thank you. Yeah, I\'92ve got an idea for an electric jet.\
\
Tony: You do?\
\
Mr Musk: Yeah.\
\
Tony: Then we\'92ll make it work. [To Pepper as they walk] You want a massage?\
\
Pepper: Oh, God. No. I don\'92t want a massage.\
\
Tony: I\'92ll have Natalie make an\'85\
\
Pepper: I don\'92t want Natalie to do\'85\
\
Tony: Don\'92t want you tense. By the way, I didn\'92t mean to spring this on you.\
\
Pepper: Thank you very much.\
\
Tony: Green is not your best colour. [Justin\'92s head appears from behind someone]\
\
Pepper: Oh, please.\
\
Justin: Anthony. Is that you?\
\
Tony: [To Pepper] My least favourite person on Earth.\
\
Justin: Hey, pal.\
\
Tony: Justin Hammer.\
\
Justin: How you doing? You\'92re not the only rich guy here with a fancy car. You know Christine Everhart from Vanity Fair. You guys know each other? [She appears.]\
\
Christine: Hi. Yes.\
\
Pepper: Yes.\
\
Tony: Yes, roughly.\
\
Pepper: We do.\
\
Justin: BTW, big story. The new CEO of Stark Industries.\
\
Christine: I know, I know.\
\
Justin: Congratulations.\
\
Christine: My editor will kill me if I don\'92t grab a quote for our Powerful Women issue.\
\
Pepper: Oh.\
\
Christine: Can I?\
\
Pepper: Sure.\
\
Justin: She\'92s actually doing a big spread on me for Vanity Fair. I thought I\'92d throw her a bone, you know. Right?\
\
Pepper: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.\
\
Tony: And she wrote a story as well.\
\
Pepper: It was very impressive.\
\
Tony: That was good.\
\
Pepper: It was very well done.\
\
Christine: Thank you.\
\
Pepper: I\'92m gonna go wash.\
\
Tony: Don\'92t leave me.\
\
Justin: Hey, buddy. How you doing?\
\
Tony: I\'92m all right.\
\
Justin: Looking gorgeous.\
\
Tony: Please, this is tough.\
\
Christine: Can I ask you\'85 Is this the first time\'85\
\
Justin: [Posing for a camera while Tony replaces sunglasses and tries to escape] Fromage [French for cheese. That bit did have a subtitle] Say \'93Brie\'94.\
\
Christine: \'85that you guys have seen each other?\
\
Tony: God, that\'92s so awful.\
\
Christine: Listen, is it the first time you\'92ve seen each other since the Senate?\
\
Tony: Since he got his contract revoked\'85\
\
Justin: Actually, it\'92s on hold.\
\
Tony: \'85when you were attempting to\'85That\'92s not what I heard. What\'92s the difference between \'93hold and \'93cancelled\'94? The truth?\
\
Christine: Yes, what is it?\
\
Justin: No. The truth is\'85 Why don\'92t we put that away? The truth is, I\'92m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.\
\
Tony: Well, if you invent something that works, I\'92ll make sure I get you a slot.\
\
Natalie: Mr Stark?\
\
Tony: Yes?\
\
Natalie: Your corner table is ready.\
\
Justin: I actually have a slot this year. Yes, I do.\
\
Tony: Hammer needs a slot, Christine.\
\
Justin: We kid, yeah. We kid. We\'92re kidders.\
\
[Tony is doing another test. It reads Blood toxicity 53%. He\'92s in a bathroom.]\
\
Tony: [In the mirror] Got any other bad ideas?\
\
[And now he\'92s in a racing suit, jumping over the barrier towards a car.]\
\
Justin: [Still inside, talking to Christine.] Tony and I\'85 Tony\'85 I love Tony Stark. Tony loves me. We\'92re not competitors. Him being out of the picture created tremendous opportunities for Hammer Industries, you know? Everything that Tony and I do\'85\
\
Tony (on TV behind Justin): Well, what\'92s the use of having\'85\
\
Justin: \'85is a healthy\'85\
\
Tony: \'85and owning a race car\'85\
\
Justin: \'85competition.\
\
Tony: \'85if you don\'92t drive it?\
\
Justin: Is he driving?\
\
[Camera shift to Pepper sitting at her table, probably waiting for Tony. She notices the television.]\
\
Pepper: Natalie. Natalie!\
\
Natalie: Yes, Ms Potts?\
\
Pepper: What do you know about this?\
\
Natalie: This is the first that I have known of it.\
\
Pepper: This, this cannot happen.\
\
Natalie: Absolutely. I understand. How can I help you?\
\
Pepper: Where\'92s Happy?\
\
Natalie: He\'92s waiting outside.\
\
Pepper: Okay, get him. I need Happy.\
\
Natalie: Right away.\
\
Justin: Tony\'92s\'85 You know, he\'85 We\'92re not competitive. You know what I mean?\
\
Christine: Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, can you excuse me just one second?\
\
Justin: Just read me what you wrote.\
\
Christine: I will. I will, after.\
\
Justin: Just read it back to me.\
\
Christine: But I have to make one quick phone call.\
\
Justin: Where are you going?\
\
Christine: This is great.\
\
Justin: I\'92ve got some caviar coming.\
\
Christine: This is great stuff. I\'92ll be right back.\
\
Someone in background: Look! That\'92s Stark.\
\
[And engines revving, set, go! The race takes off. A man dressed in orange as pit crew walks beside the track. He looks familiar. Tony\'92s surprisingly not bad at this race car driving. Orange man is on the track. Oh look, it\'92s Ivan. More French words. I got a \'93Mon Dieu\'94 I think. The lightning whips strike a car. Pepper looks terrified. For Tony. Another \'93Mon Dieu\'94 from the French commentator. Means \'93My God\'94 by the way. Happy appears at the door and holds up the briefcase. Pepper goes with him to the car and gets in the back.]\
\
Pepper: Go, go.\
\
Happy: Hang on. [Crashes through a barrier onto the track heading the opposite way to the race cars. Tony\'92s car gets hit and he goes flying, loosing the front. Ivan heads forward. Another car gets hit. Bit of fire. Dripping petrol. Never a good sign.]\
\
Pepper: Give me the case.\
\
Happy: Here, take it.\
\
Pepper: Where\'92s the key?\
\
Happy: It\'92s in my pocket.\
\
Pepper: Car!\
\
[Ivan slices more of Tony\'92s car, but he\'92s gone. Tony comes up from behind him and whacks him around the head with a sheet of metal. Fighting. Tony is knocked on the floor. Sees dripping petrol. Ivan begins to swings the whips. Tony moves, hits petrol and the car bursts into flames. Happy appears, driving and runs Ivan into the fence. Tony is up the fence]\
\
Tony: Are you okay?\
\
Happy: Yeah.\
\
Tony: Were you heading from me or him?\
\
Happy: I was trying to scare him.\
\
Tony: \'91Cause I can\'92t tell!\
\
Pepper: Are you out of your mind?\
\
Tony: Better security.\
\
Pepper: Get in the car right now!\
\
Tony: I was attacked. We need better security.\
\
Happy: Get in the car.\
\
Tony: You\'92re CEO. Better security measures. God, it\'92s embarrassing. [Ivan\'92s head moves. Tony opens the door] First vacation in two years. [And Ivan slices the door in half. Darn it Ivan, it\'92s a Rolls, be nicer to her]\
\
Pepper: Oh my God! [Happy reverses a bit and runs into Ivan again.]\
\
Happy: I got him!\
\
Tony: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.\
\
Happy: I got him.\
\
Pepper: Take the case! Take it!\
\
Tony: Give him the case!\
\
Pepper: Stop banging the car! [Out comes the airbag and Ivan slices the car in half. He continues to slice at the car]\
\
Tony: Calm down.\
\
Pepper: God. God.\
\
Tony: Give me the case! Please! Come on! [Pepper throws the case, Tony stand on it and it turns into the Iron Man Suit! A fight begins. Which involves more damage to the car and damage to the Iron Man suit. Tony rips out the Arc Reactor, shutting off Ivan\'92s suit.]\
\
Ivan: [Being taken away by the police] You\'85 You lose. You lose Stark. [Justin smiles.]\
\
[Scene change. In a prison.]\
\
Police officer [French]: We ran his prints. We got nothing back, not even a name.\
\
Tony [French]: Where are we going?\
\
Police Officer [French]: Over there. We\'92re not even sure he speaks English. He hasn\'92t said a word since he got here.\
\
Tony [French]: Five minutes.\
\
Police officer [French]: [opening door] Five minutes. \{Door is shut behind Tony.]\
\
Tony: Pretty decent tech. Cycles per second were a little low. You could have doubled up your rotations. You focused the repulsor energy through ionised plasma channels. It\'92s effective. Not very efficient. But it\'92s a passable knock-off. I don\'92t get it. A little fine tuning you could have made a solid pay check. You could have sold it to North Korea, China, Iran, or gone onto the black market. You look like you got friends in low places.\
\
Ivan: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.\
\
Tony: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?\
\
Ivan: My father. Anton Vanko.\
\
Tony: Well, I never heard of him.\
\
Ivan: My father is the reason you\'92re alive.\
\
Tony: The reason I\'92m alive is \'91cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.\
\
Ivan: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.\
\
Tony: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That\'92s right. A prison cell. I\'92ll send you a bar of soap. [He gets up to leave]\
\
Ivan: Hey, Tony. Before you go, palladium in the chest, painful way to die. [Tony leaves the cell]\
\
[Scene change. On Tony\'92s private aeroplane. Stern is on the television]\
\
Stern: It\'92s just unbelievable. It proves that the genie is out of the bottle and this man has no idea what he\'92s doing. He thinks of the Iron Man weapon as a toy. I was at a hearing where Mr Stark, in fact, was adamant that these suits can\'92t exist anywhere else, don\'92t exist anywhere else, never will exist anywhere else, at least for five to ten years, and here we are in Monaco realising, \'93These suits exist now.\'94\
\
Tony: Mute. He should be giving me a medal. That\'92s the truth.\
\
Pepper: What is that?\
\
Tony: This is your in-flight meal.\
\
Pepper: Did you just make that?\
\
Tony: Yeah. Where do you think I\'92ve been for three hours?\
\
Pepper: Tony, what are you not telling me?\
\
Tony: I don\'92t want to go home. At all. Let\'92s cancel my birthday party and\'85 We\'92re in Europe. Let\'92s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?\
\
Pepper: Oh, yes.\
\
Tony: It\'92s a great place to be healthy.\
\
Pepper: I don\'92t think this is the right time. We\'92re in kind of a mess.\
\
Tony: Yeah, but maybe that\'92s why it\'92s the best time. \'91Cause then we can\'85\
\
Pepper: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.\
\
Tony: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.\
\
Pepper: A leave?\
\
Tony: A company retreat.\
\
Pepper: A retreat? During a time like this?\
\
Tony: Just a ride. Well, I\'92m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.\
\
Pepper: Not everybody runs on batteries Tony.\
\
[Ivan is in a cell. A guard drops of food. Someone\'92s left a note about enjoying the potatoes. That would be easier if they were potatoes and not an explosive. A man enters, dressed like Ivan, down to the number. Ivan escapes. More French shouting. There was defiantly an \'93allez\'94 in there. Ivan gets knocked out. He awakens somewhere else]\
\
Justin: Hey. There he is. There he is. What an absolute pleasure. Welcome. Oh goodness gracious. Can we get the handcuffs off my friend here? Forgive me, I\'92m sorry. I\'92m such a huge fan of yours. I didn\'92t want to make a first impression like this. He\'92s not an animal. Come on. He\'92s a human being. Thank you. We\'92re fine. My name is Justin Hammer. I\'92d like to do some business with you. Please sit. Dig in. What do we have today Jack?\
\
Jack: We have some salmon carpaccio.\
\
Justin: Salmon carpaccio. Anything you want here, we got it. I like my dessert first. I had this flown in from San Francisco. It\'92s Italian though. Organic ice cream. I got a sweet tooth. Apparently you do too, for Tony Stark. What I saw you do to Tony Stark on that track, how you stepped up to him in front of God and everybody that was\'85 Wow. You spoke to me with what you did. And I know that you knew that I\'92d be listening. This is why I couldn\'92t bear to have you shipped off to God knows where. It would have been such a waste of talent. But if I might make a suggestion, you know, you don\'92t just go and try to kill the guy. I think, if I may, you go after his legacy. That\'92s what you kill. You and me, we are a lot alike in a lot of ways. The only difference between you and I is that I have resources. I think, if I may, you need my resources. Someone behind you, a benefactor. I\'92d like to be that guy.\
\
Ivan: [Russian; no subs unintelligible]\
\
Justin: Okay. Do you speak English? Because I can get a translator. I don\'92t know. Have you been understanding everything I\'92m saying?\
\
Ivan: Very good, man.\
\
Justin: Very good, man.\
\
Ivan: Very good, man.\
\
Justin: Hey!\
\
Ivan: [clinking bottle with Justin\'92s glass] Hey.\
\
Justin: Yes?\
\
Ivan: I want my bird.\
\
Justin: A bird? You want a bird?\
\
Ivan: I want my bird.\
\
Justin: I can get you a bird. I can get you ten birds.\
\
Ivan: I want my bird.\
\
Justin: Well, okay. Nothing\'92s impossible. I could\'85 Are we talking about\'85 Is this a bird back in Russia?\
\
[Scene change. Pepper and Natalie are back in Malibu.]\
\
Pepper: [on phone] Yes, but the fundamentals of the company are still very, very strong despite the events in Monaco.\
\
Natalie: [also on phone. But a different phone] Yes, of course. [To Pepper] The AP wants a quote.\
\
Pepper: [covers speaker] Don\'92t tell them. Fax them\'85\
\
Rhodey: [entering] Where is he?\
\
Natalie: He doesn\'92t want to be disturbed.\
\
Pepper: He\'92s downstairs.\
\
News reader (on television): But what happened in Monaco?\
\
Pepper: Yes, but\'85.\
\
News reader: But his continuing erratic behaviour may lead many people to ask themselves, \'93Can this man still protect us?\'94\
\
Pepper: Iron Man never stopped protecting us. The events in Monaco proved that.\
\
[Scene change. Tony is sitting in a car in his workshop looking at holograms.]\
\
JARVIS: Query complete sir. Anton Vanko was a Soviet physicist who defected to the United States in 1963.However, he was accused of espionage and was deported in 1967. His son, Ivan, who is also a physicist, was convicted of selling Soviet-era weapons grade plutonium to Pakistan, and served 15 years in Kopeisk prison. No further records exist. [Rhodey enters]\
\
Rhodey: Tony, you gotta get upstairs and get on top of this situation right now. Listen. I\'92ve been on the phone with the National Guard all day, trying to talk them out of rolling tanks up the PCH, knocking down your front door and taking these. They\'92re gonna take your suits, Tony, okay? They\'92re sick of the games. You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It\'92s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay?\
\
Tony: Let\'92s go. [Gets out the car. And falls.]\
\
Rhodey: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?\
\
Tony: Yeah, I should get to my desk. [Rhodey supports him] See that cigar box?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah.\
\
Tony: It\'92s palladium.\
\
Rhodey: [Tony removes Arc Reactor] Is that supposed to be smoking?\
\
Tony: If you must know, it\'92s neutron damage. It\'92s from the reactor wall.\
\
Rhodey: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?\
\
Tony: Road rash. Thank you. [Replaces Arc Reactor and starts drinking green liquid again.] What are you looking at?\
\
Rhodey: I\'92m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it\'92s unnecessary. You don\'92t have to do this alone.\
\
Tony: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you\'92ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I\'92m doing.\
\
QUEENS, NEW YORK.\
\
Justin: This is where we do it. This is my humble abode. You can work in absolute peace. Must be fun to be dead, right? No pressure. Here they are. I\'92m very excited. They\'92re combat-ready. I may have done a few miscalculations and rushed the prototype into production. Sue me, I\'92m enthusiastic. Go ahead, take a look around. [Ivan puts on glasses and heads towards a computer] You don\'92t wanna do that. You\'92ll be able to access that as soon as we generate some encrypted pass codes. Can we generate some encrypted pass codes? Get some of those encrypted pass codes, Jack. Never mind, I\'85 Wow. Okay. Good stuff.\
\
Ivan: [Something Russian] unintelligible\
\
Justin: Sorry?\
\
Ivan: Software shit.\
\
Justin: Well\'85 You\'92re good. You really blasted in past the firewall there. Let me show you where you\'92re gonna be working primarily. Go ahead, take a look. Get a good look at that. That\'92s something, isn\'92t it? You know, those are really just for show and tell. They\'92re $125.7 million a pop, so\'85 Wait! [Ivan pulls off one\'92s head] Oh gosh. Jesus Christ. Get somebody up here. That\'92s where the pilot goes. I\'92m having a tough time finding volunteers. I\'92ll take care of that, just leave it.\
\
Ivan: What you want them do?\
\
Justin: Well, long term, I want them to put me in the Pentagon for the next 25 years. I want to make Iron Man look like an antique. I wanna go to that Stark Expo, I wanna take a dump in Tony Stark\'92s front yard. You know what I\'92m talking about?\
\
Ivan: I can do that. No problem.\
\
Justin: Yeah? Hey, fabulous! I love it. Hey, this is our guy. Didn\'92t I tell you? I had a feeling.\
\
[Tony\'92s rash on his chest is getting worse. Natalie enters.]\
\
Natalie: Do you know which watch you\'92d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?\
\
Tony: I\'92ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.\
\
Natalie: Probably.\
\
Tony: Yeah. \'91Cause it\'92s\'85\
\
Natalie: Ill-timed.\
\
Tony: Right, sends the wrong message.\
\
Natalie: Inappropriate. [Tony drinks a bit of his drink that Natalie hands him] Is that dirty enough for you?\
\
Tony: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I\'92ll give that a look. Bring them over. [Natalie hands him the box of watches] I\'92ll take that. Why don\'92t you\'85 [She sits, smiles softly and starts helping him cover his bruise] I gotta say it. It\'92s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?\
\
Natalie: Legal.\
\
Tony: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?\
\
Natalie: I\'92d do whatever I wanted to do with whoever I wanted to do it with. [She leaves Tony finishes his drink. Scene change. He\'92s now drunk, by a DJ, dancing in the suit. Cars pull up outside]\
\
Person: Good evening\
\
Person: Good evening\
\
Rhodey: Yes, sir, I understand. No. No, sir, that will not be necessary. I\'92ll handle it. Sir, I personally guarantee that within 24 hours, Iron Man will be back on watch. [Enters party] Hey Pepper.\
\
Pepper: I\'92m going to get some air.\
\
Rhodey: What\'92s wrong?\
\
Pepper: [Showing Rhodey Tony] I don\'92t know what to do.\
\
Rhodey: You gotta be kidding me. [Tony falls over, drunk] That\'92s it, I\'92m making\'85.\
\
Pepper: No, no, no. Don\'92t call anyone.\
\
Rhodey: Pepper. This is ridiculous. I just stuck my neck out for this guy.\
\
Pepper: I know. I know. I get it. I\'92m gonna handle it, okay Just let me handle it.\
\
Rhodey: Handle it. Or I\'92m gonna have to.\
\
Tony: [To crowd] You know, the question I get asked most often is, \'93Tony, how do you go to the bathroom in the suit?\'94 Just like that. [Cheering. Pepper walks up to him]\
\
Pepper: Does this guy know how to throw a party or what?\
\
Tony: I love you.\
\
Pepper: Unbelievable! Thank you so much. Tony, we all thank you so much for such a wonderful night. And we\'92re gonna say good night now, and thank you all for coming.\
\
Tony: No, no, no, we can\'92t \'85 Wait, wait, wait. We didn\'92t have the cake. We didn\'92t blow out the candles.\
\
Pepper: You\'92re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?\
\
Tony: You\'92re out of control gorgeous.\
\
Pepper: It\'92s time to go to bed. It\'92s time.\
\
Tony: Give me another smooch\
\
Pepper: You\'92re not going to be happy about this.\
\
Tony: Come on, you know you want to.\
\
Pepper: You just peed in the suit.\
\
Tony: I know. It has a filtration system.\
\
Pepper: It\'92s not sexy.\
\
Tony: You could drink that water.\
\
Pepper: Just send everybody home, okay? It\'92s time to\'85\
\
Tony: If you say so.\
\
Pepper: Okay. I\'92ll take this, you take that [exchanges microphone for bottle]\
\
Tony: Pepper Potts. She\'92s right. The party\'92s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn\'92t like it, there\'92s the door. [accidently shoots it with the suit.] Yeah! [Girl throws bottle it the air] Hit! [Rhodey leaves as he shoots it] Pull! [Rhodey goes downstairs. Drunk girl is still throwing things for Tony to shoot. Rhodey gets into one of the suits. Another girl appears with a watermelon] I think she wants the Gallagher!\
\
Rhodey: [In full suit] I\'92m only gonna say this once. Get out. [Helmet slips down. Everybody leaves.] You don\'92t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!\
\
Tony: [To DJ] Goldstein.\
\
Goldstein: Yes, Mr Stark?\
\
Tony: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy\'92s ass to. [Laughs. Another One Bites the Dust by Queen starts to play.]\
\
Rhodey: [Grabbing hold on Tony from behind] I told you to shut it down. [Tony takes off backwards]\
\
Tony: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. [Rhodey throws things at him] Really? [Tony hits him with a set of weights] Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn\'92t have a sidekick.\
\
Rhodey: [Hitting Tony with a pipe] Sidekick this. [Tony goes up throw the ceiling.] Had enough?\
\
[Quick camera angle shift]\
\
Pepper: Natalie!\
\
Natalie: Miss Potts.\
\
Pepper: Don\'92t you \'93Miss Potts\'94 me! I\'92m on to you. You know what? Ever since you came here\'85 [Tony and Rhodey come crashing through the ceiling]\
\
Happy: Pepper! [Runs in to get her out of the way] Get out of here. Get out of here now. [Natalie heads off somewhere.]\
\
Tony: You want it? Take it! [Beats Rhodey and turns to growl at crowd, who run off. Rhodey gets back up]\
\
Rhodey: Put you hand down.\
\
Tony: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?\
\
Rhodey: We don\'92t have to do this, Tony.\
\
Tony: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.\
\
Rhodey: Put it down!\
\
Tony: You gonna take a shot?\
\
Rhodey: Put it down!\
\
Tony: No!\
\
Rhodey: Drop it Tony!\
\
Tony: Take it! [Their blasts meet and there goes Tony\'92s house. Both of them are knocked backwards. Tony looks around and sees Rhodey take off in the suit.]\
\
EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE\
\
MOJAVE, CA\
\
Rhodey: Edwards Tower, this is Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes, inbound from three miles east at 5,000 feet\'85 [Rhodey lands in suit.]\
\
Major Allen: Colonel.\
\
Rhodey: Major.\
\
Major Allen: Wow.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah. Let\'92s take it inside.\
\
Major Allen: Clear the area.\
\
[Scene change. Tony is sitting inside a doughnut, eating a doughnut. Pans out to see Nick Fury looking up at him.]\
\
Nick Fury: Sir! I\'92m gonna have to ask you to exit the doughnut.\
\
Tony: [Now inside sitting at a table with Fury] I told you I don\'92t wanna join your super-secret boy band.\
\
Fury: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How\'92s that working out for you?\
\
Tony: It\'92s\'85 It\'92s\'85 It\'92s\'85 I\'92m sorry. I don\'92t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I\'92m a bit hung over. I\'92m not sure if you\'92re real of if I\'92m having\'85\
\
Fury: I am very real. I\'92m the realest person you\'92re ever gonna meet.\
\
Tony: Just my luck. Where\'92s the staff here?\
\
Fury: That\'92s not looking so good.\
\
Tony: I\'92ve been worse. [A woman walks over. Camera angle is such that you can\'92t see her face.]\
\
SHIELD agent: We\'92ve secured the perimeter but I don\'92t think we should hold it for too much longer.\
\
Tony: [Looks over top of glasses. Sees Natalie.] You\'92re fired.\
\
Natalie: That\'92s not up to you. [Sits down next to Fury]\
\
Fury: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.\
\
Tony: Hi.\
\
Natalie/Agent Romanoff: I\'92m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.\
\
Tony: I suggest you apologise.\
\
Fury: You\'92ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you\'92re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn\'92t know better\'85\
\
Tony: You don\'92t know better. I didn\'92t give it to him. He took it.\
\
Fury: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He took it? You\'92re Iron Man and he just took it? The little brother walked in there, kicked your ass and took your suit? [Turns to Agent Romanoff] Is that possible?\
\
Agent Romanoff: Well, according to Mr Stark\'92s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.\
\
Tony: What do you want from me?\
\
Fury: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? [Agent Romanoff leaves] You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. [Romanoff returns with an injection] Hit him.\
\
Tony: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? [Rash goes down] Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?\
\
Fury: What did we just do for you? That\'92s lithium dioxide. It\'92s gonna take the edge off. We\'92re trying to get you back to work.\
\
Tony: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I\'92ll be right as rain.\
\
Agent Romanoff: It\'92s not a cure, it just abates the symptoms.\
\
Fury: Doesn\'92t look like it\'92s gonna be an easy fix.\
\
Tony: Trust me, I know. I\'92m good at this stuff. I\'92ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I\'92ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.\
\
Fury: Well, I\'92m here to tell you, you haven\'92t tried them all.\
\
[Scene change. Hammer Industries]\
\
Justin: Hey, hey, het. Special delivery. Candygram. [Ivan climbs down from where he was working] I brought you something. Oh yeah. [Removes cloth] We got you the bird, pal.\
\
Ivan: This is not my bird.\
\
Justin: What do you mean? That\'92s the bird. This is the bird. Yeah, pulled a lot of strings to get this bird. This is a great bird.\
\
Jack: It\'92s a beautiful bird.\
\
Justin: We got this bird all the way from Russia.\
\
Ivan: Hey, man, this is not my bird.\
\
Justin: Well, listen, even if it\'92s not the bird, I mean, this is a gorgeous bird. I mean, you know, look, don\'92t get so attached to things. Learn to let go. Wait a minute. Jack, what is that? Is that\'85 That\'92s not a helmet. What is that? [Walks up to suit] Ivan\'85 What\'92s this? Jack. Is that a helmet? It doesn\'92t look like a helmet to me. How\'85 How are you supposed to get a head in there? Jack, could you put your head in there?\
\
Jack: No.\
\
Justin: Try to put your head in there. Go ahead. Try to put your head in there. [Jack put it on his head] See, Ivan? He can\'92t put his head in there. That\'92s\'85 That\'92s not a helmet. It\'92s a head. I need to put a guy in there. I need to fit a person in that suit. You understand?\
\
Ivan: Drone better.\
\
Justin: What? Drone better? Why is drone better? Why is drone better?\
\
Ivan: People make problem. Trust me. Drone better.\
\
Justin: Ivan, you know, I like you. I got you the bird. You said, \'93No problem.\'94 That\'92s what you said to me. You said, \'93No problem.\'94 Now I need suits. The government wants suits. Like Iron Man. You understand? That\'92s what the people want. That\'92s what\'92s gonna make them happy.\
\
Ivan: Hey, man. Don\'92t get too attached to things. Learn to let go.\
\
Justin: These drones better steal the show, Ivan. You understand? Better rock my world, Ivan.\
\
[Scene change. Air base]\
\
General: Unbelievable. This ought to get the Senate off my ass. It\'92s functional?\
\
Rhodey: Fully mission-capable.\
\
General: Good. Get Hammer down here to weaponise it.\
\
Rhodey: Sir?\
\
General: Justin Hammer\'92s making a weapons presentation at the Expo. We\'92d like this to introduce it.\
\
Rhodey: Sir, I don\'92t believe that the Expo\'85\
\
General: Colonel, the world needs to see this fast. We\'92ve got to make this happen.\
\
Rhodey: Yes, General, but\'85\
\
General: It\'92s also an order.\
\
Rhodey: Yes sir.\
\
General: Good work, Colonel. You\'92ve made your country proud.\
\
Rhodey: Thank you sir.\
\
[Scene change. Tony\'92s house. It\'92s a bit broken. He is sitting with Nick Fury.]\
\
Fury: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.\
\
Tony: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my\'85\
\
Fury: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.\
\
Tony: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?\
\
Fury: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn\'92t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.\
\
Tony: You told me I hadn\'92t tried everything. What do you mean I haven\'92t tried everything? What haven\'92t I tried?\
\
Fury: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.\
\
Tony: He said that?\
\
Fury: Are you that guy? Are you? \'91Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.\
\
Tony: I don\'92t know where you get your information, but he wasn\'92t my biggest fan.\
\
Fury: What do you remember about your dad?\
\
Tony: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it\'92s a little tough for me to digest when you\'92re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he\'92s passing it down. I don\'92t get that. You\'92re talking about a guy who\'92s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.\
\
Fury: That\'92s not true.\
\
Tony: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.\
\
Fury: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.\
\
Tony: What?\
\
Fury: I got a two o\'92clock\
\
Tony: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What\'92s this?\
\
Fury: Okay, you\'92re good, right?\
\
Tony: No, I\'92m not good.\
\
Fury: You got this? Right? Right?\
\
Tony: Got what? I don\'92t even know what I\'92m supposed to get.\
\
Fury: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?\
\
Tony: Yeah.\
\
Fury: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you. [Fury leaves]\
\
Natalie/Agent Romanoff/Natasha (We\'92ll stick with Natasha from now on): We\'92ve disabled all communications. No contact with the outside world. Good luck. [She leaves]\
\
Tony: [Turning to Agent Coulson] Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I\'92ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that\'92d be nice.\
\
Agent Coulson: I\'92m not here for that. I\'92ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?\
\
Tony: I think I got it, yeah.\
\
Agent Coulson: Enjoy your evening\'92s entertainment. [Leaves. Tony looks at the box that has been left for him.]\
\
[Scene change. Air base. Dismantling the suit]\
\
Major Allen: Think this is the power source?\
\
Rhodey: Major, this is not a scientific exercise. Let\'92s just focus on arming it, all right?\
\
Major Allen: Yes, sir.\
\
Justin: [Entering. Sucking on a red lollipop.] Oh, yes! Oh, yes, yes, yes. Is it my birthday? You got it. What did you do? What did you do? Is this what I think it is?\
\
Rhodey: Yes it is. Hammer, I want to know what you\'92re gonna do for us.\
\
Justin: What am I going to do for you? Well, the first thing I\'92m gonna do for you is I\'92m gonna upgrade your software. And then, second, I think I should\'85\
\
Rhodey: That\'92s not what I\'92m talking about. I\'92m talking about firepower.\
\
Justin: Well, you\'92re talking to the right guy. [Bites lollipop. Time jump. Kind of. He now has weapons to show to Rhodey.] Claridge Hi-Tec, semi-automatic, 9mm pistol. Too downtown? I agree. M24 shotgun, pump action. Five-round magazine. You know what? You\'92re not a hunter. What am I talking about? I\'92m getting rid of it. This is the FN-2000 from Belgium. They do make something better than waffles. It\'92s beautiful, But I can tell this isn\'92t disco enough for you, so I\'92m gonna put it right here. You\'92re looking at a Milkor 40mm grenade launcher. Tear gas, smoke. Hippie control. You\'92re tough. Let me tell you something. Size does matter. Don\'92t let anyone tell you different. This is an M134 7.62 Minigun. Six invidual barrels. The torso taker, powder maker. Our boys in uniform call in Uncle Gazpacho or Puff the Magic Dragon. Okay. These are the Cubans, baby. This is the Cohibas, the Montecristos. This is a kinetic-kill, side-winder vehicle with a secondary cyclotrimethlyenetrinitamine RDX burst. It\'92s capable of busting the bunker under the bunker you just busted. If it were any smarter, it would write a book. A book that would make Ulysses look like it was written in crayon. It would read it to you. This is my Eiffel Tower. This is my Rachmaninoff\'92s Third. My Pieta. It\'92s completely elegant. It\'92s bafflingly beautiful. And it\'92s capable of reducing the population of any standing structure to zero. I call it the Ex-Wife. That\'92s the best I got. Are we gonna do this? Give me something here. You\'92re like a sphinx. I can\'92t read you.\
\
Rhodey: I think I\'92ll take it.\
\
Justin: Which one?\
\
Rhodey: All of it.\
\
Justin: All of it.\
\
[Scene change. Tony is looking through the box. Blue prints for the arc reactor. Newspaper articles. Video reels.]\
\
Howard (on video): Everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust heath, [Tony is flicking through a notebook as the video plays] and for the first time in human history, the possibility of world peace. I\'92m Howard Stark, and everything you\'92ll need for the future can be found right here. City of the Future? City of Tomorrow? City of\'85 I\'92m Howard Stark and everything you\'92ll need in the future can be found right here. So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I would like to personally\'85 Tony, what are you doing back there? What is that? [Little Tony has picked one of the buildings up off the model.] Put that back. Put it back where you got it from. Where\'92s your mother? Maria? Go on. Go, go, go, go. [A man takes little Tony off, presumably to where his mother is]\
\
Man (out of sight): All right, I think we got\'85\
\
Howard: I\'92ll\'85 I\'92ll\'85 I\'92ll come in and\'85 [Video changes]\
\
Man: Are you waiting on me? [Howard drinks. Looks like whiskey. Video changes again]\
\
Howard: So, from all of us at Stark Industries, I\'92d like to personally show you my ass. I\'92d like to\'85 I can\'92t\'85 This is\'85 I can\'92t\'85 We have this, don\'92t we? This is a ridiculous way\'85 Everything [Tony reaches end of notebook. Blank pages. Probably ones his father never got to fill in as he died] is achievable through technology. [Tony throws the book to one side and drinks] Tony. You\'92re too young to understand this right now, so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you. And someday you\'92ll realise that it represents a whole lot more than just people\'92s inventions. It represents my life\'92s work. This is the key to the future. I\'92m limited by the technology of my time, but one day you\'92ll figure this out. And when you do, you will change the world. What is and always will be my greatest creation is you. [Tony looks like he\'92s about to cry as the film ends.\
\
Scene change. He\'92s driving down a road in car number plate Stark11\
\
He stops to but some strawberries.]\
\
Tony [Spanish]: How much?\
\
Strawberry man: $6. Six.\
\
Tony: I don\'92t have any dough. Here. [Takes off watch]\
\
Strawberry man: No, sir, that\'92s too much.\
\
Tony: No, it\'92s fine. Take that. It\'92s fine\
\
Strawberry man: No, se\'f1or.\
\
Tony: Take it. Take it. I don\'92t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that\'92d be great.\
\
Strawberry man: Are you Iron Man?\
\
Tony: Sometimes.\
\
Strawberry man: [As Tony drives off] We believe in you!\
\
[Now in Pepper\'92s office]\
\
Pepper: It was an illegal seizure of trademark property.\
\
PA: Miss Potts?\
\
Tony: Relax.\
\
PA: Mr Stark\'85\
\
Tony: Is here.\
\
PA: He refuses\'85\
\
Tony: I don\'92t. It\'92s fine. I\'92ll just be a second.\
\
Pepper (on phone): Listen, it\'92s our position that Stark has and continues to maintain propriety ownership of the Mark II platform.\
\
News reporter (on telly): When Mr Stark announced he was indeed Iron Man, he was making a promise to America.\
\
Pepper: No, the suit belongs to us.\
\
News reporter: We trusted that he would look out for us.\
\
Pepper: Yeah, but you\'92re not\'85\
\
News reporter: He obviously did not.\
\
Pepper: Burt\'85\
\
News reporter: And now we learn that his secretary\'85\
\
Pepper: Yes, it does.\
\
News reporter: \'85a woman named Virginia \'93Pepper\'94 Potts, has been appointed as CEO of Stark Industries. What are her qualifications?\
\
Pepper: No.\
\
News reporter: Miss Potts has done nothing to manage this terrible\'85\
\
Tony: Mute.\
\
Pepper: No\'85 Burt\'85 Burt\'85 Burt, listen to me. Don\'92t tell me that we have the best patent lawyers in the country and then not let me pursue this.\
\
Tony: [Looking at boxes and things in the corner.] I\'92ll get this stuff out of here.\
\
Pepper: Well, then, tell the President to sign an order. We\'92ll talk about it at the Expo. [Tony pulls back a sheet and finds the same model as that that was in the video with his father] Hammer\'92s giving some presentation tomorrow evening. Will Tony Stark be there?\
\
Tony: [Pulling up a chair] Will I?\
\
Pepper: No, he will not. Bye.\
\
Tony: I would like to be. Got a minute?\
\
Pepper: No.\
\
Tony: Come on, you just got off the phone. You\'92re fine. 30 seconds.\
\
Pepper: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.\
\
Tony: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I\'92m not.\
\
Pepper: You didn\'92t come here to apologise?\
\
Tony: Look, that goes without saying, and I\'92m working on that. But I haven\'92t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It\'92s like a Ferris wheel, going. I\'92m trying to get some\'85\
\
Pepper: No.\
\
Tony: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express\'85 And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don\'92t care\'85 I mean, I care. It would be nice. I\'92m not expecting you to\'85 Look, here\'92s what I\'92m trying to say. I\'92m just gonna say it.\
\
Pepper: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say \'93I\'94 one more time, I\'92m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?\
\
Tony: Yes.\
\
Pepper: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you\'92ve disappeared, and all I\'92m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there\'92s only one thing on Earth that I\'92m allergic to?\
\
Tony: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.\
\
Pepper: I need you\'85\
\
Tony: I need you too.\
\
Pepper: \'85to leave now\
\
Tony: That\'92s what I\'92m trying to\'85\
\
Natasha: [Entering as Natalie in front of Happy] Ms Potts?\
\
Pepper: Hi, come on in.\
\
Natasha: Wheels up in 25 minutes.\
\
Pepper: Thank you.\
\
Happy: Anything else, boss?\
\
Tony: I\'92m good, Hap.\
\
Pepper: No, I\'92ll be just another minute.\
\
Tony: I lost both the kids in the divorce. [Tony looks over to Happy, who shakes his head.] Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn\'92t it? I thought you two didn\'92t get along?\
\
Pepper: No. That\'92s not so.\
\
Tony: It\'92s just me you don\'92t care for. No? Nothing?\
\
Pepper: Actually, while you\'92re here maybe you and Natalie could discuss the matter of the personal belongings.\
\
Natasha: Absolutely. [Pepper and Happy leave] I\'92m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.\
\
Tony: Boy, you\'92re good. You are mind-blowingly duplicitous. How do you do it? You just tear things\'85 You\'92re a triple imposter. I\'92ve never seen anything like you. Is there anything real about you? Do you even speak Latin?\
\
Natasha: [Latin]\
\
Tony: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?\
\
Natasha: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. [She leaves.]\
\
Tony: You\'92re good. [Piles things up under desk spinny thing and throws strawberries in the bin. Goes back to the model and looks at it through one eye.\
\
Scene change. Driving it home, fading into workshop]\
\
Tony: Jarvis, could you kindly Vac-U-Form a digital wire frame? I need a manipulatable projection.\
\
Jarvis: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.\
\
Tony: [Lifting the blue projection away from the model] How many buildings are there?\
\
Jarvis: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?\
\
Tony: That was rhetorical. Just show me. [Clicks his fingers and the model begins to spin and lifts upright] What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.\
\
Jarvis: What is it you\'92re trying to achieve, sir?\
\
Tony: I\'92m discovering\'85 Correction. I\'92m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. [Tony flicks things away] Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. [The model now resembles a nucleus and Tony expands it.] Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. [Tony snaps down so the model fits in his hand]\
\
Jarvis: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.\
\
Tony: Thank Dad.\
\
Jarvis: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.\
\
Tony: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We\'92re back in hardware mode.\
\
[Smashing walls with sledge hammers, drilling holes in the floor, fiddling with wires, putting together pipes.\
\
Agent Coulson enters]\
\
Agent Coulson: I heard you broke the perimeter.\
\
Tony: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?\
\
Agent Coulson: I was doing some stuff.\
\
Tony: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I\'92m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?\
\
Agent Coulson: [Pulls a familiar looking object out of a box] What\'92s this doing here?\
\
Tony: That\'92s it. Bring that to me.\
\
Agent Coulson: You know what this is?\
\
Tony: [As Agent Coulson hands it to him] It\'92s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And\'85 Drop it. Drop it. [The shield is now in position and the coil straight.] Perfectly level. I\'92m busy. What do you want?\
\
Agent Coulson: Nothing. Goodbye. I\'92ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.\
\
Tony: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.\
\
Agent Coulson: So I\'92m told.\
\
Tony: Secret stuff?\
\
Agent Coulson: Something like that. Good luck.\
\
Tony: Bye. Thanks. [They shake hands]\
\
Agent Coulson: We need you.\
\
Tony: Yeah, more than you know.\
\
Agent Coulson: Not that much. [He leaves. Tony goes back to building.]\
\
Jarvis: Initialising prismatic accelerator. [Tony turns a wheel on top] Approaching maximum power. [Using a wrench as a lever, the wheel is turned, but not before cutting holes in the wall. Eventually it\'92s concentrated on a triangle which begins to glow blue.]\
\
Tony: That was easy. [He removes the triangle using a pair of pliers]\
\
Jarvis: Congratulations sir. You have created a new element. [Placed into arc reactor] Sir, the reactor has accepted the modified core. I will begin running diagnostics.\
\
[Scene change. Ivan is also building an arc reactor]\
\
Justin (on phone from golf course): Hey Ivan. I got Senator Stern here. Thought we\'92d swing over and look at some of the drone designs.\
\
Ivan: The drone is not going to be ready.\
\
Justin: Not ready? What do you mean?\
\
Ivan: I can make presentation, not demonstration.\
\
Justin: What the hell is the difference?\
\
Ivan: Presentation. No fly. No shoot.\
\
Justin: Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait. What can you make them do? I mean, this is a weapons demonstration.\
\
Ivan: I can make salute.\
\
Justin: You can make salute? What do you mean \'93make salute\'94? What the hell does that mean Ivan? This is not what we agreed to, okay? You promised me suits and then you promised me drones. [Camera pans to show Ivan has remade his arc reactor whips]\
\
Ivan: Hey, man, everything will be okay.\
\
Justin: This is not what I wanted.\
\
[Justin is back at Hammer Industries. Enters Ivan\'92s room with two men.]\
\
Justin: Hey, there he is. It\'92s the bird man. Now you like the bird. Is that right? Is that your bird? I\'92m confused. You said it wasn\'92t, but now it looks like you\'92re the best of pals. You love that bird, don\'92t you? You know what? Take the bird.\
\
Ivan: [As man grabs bird] Hey!\
\
Justin: Take his pillows too. Both of them. And his shoes. Take his shoes. I took your stuff. How does that make you feel? Do you feel bad? Good. \'91Cause that\'92s how I feel! We had a contract. I saved your life and you give me suits. That was our deal. And you did not deliver. I don\'92t know if you\'92re a genius or a fraud. I don\'92t know what you are. Something really, really great fell into my lap. And if it hadn\'92t, I\'92d be at your mercy tonight. Now I have a piece of Stark tech that I pimped out myself. And now your overpriced paperweights and gonna look like a backdrop to my demonstration. Do you dig what I\'92m getting at here?\
\
Ivan: [Russian] unintelligible\
\
Justin: I don\'92t know if you know this, but I don\'92t speak Russian! I\'92m gonna leave now. I\'92m gonna go to the Expo. Maybe I\'92ll even get laid. You see these guys? They\'92re your babysitters. They are not to be trifled with. When I get back, we\'92re gonna renegotiate the terms of our agreement. And you\'92re gonna make good on our arrangement because if you don\'92t, you\'92re gonna be exactly what you were when I found you, a dead man. You got that? Maybe you can watch me on TV. [Leaves]\
\
[Tony\'92s house]\
\
Tony: Dummy, You, can we clean up this mess? You\'92re killing me. You know I don\'92t\'85\
\
Jarvis: Incoming call with a blocked number sir.\
\
Tony: My phone privilege is reinstated. Lovely. Coulson. How\'92s the Land of Enchantment?\
\
Ivan: Hey, Tony, how you doing? I double cycle.\
\
Tony: You what?\
\
Ivan: You told me double cycle\'92s more power. Good advice.\
\
Tony: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.\
\
Ivan: You too.\
\
Tony: [mutes his speaker] Trace him.\
\
Jarvis: Sir.\
\
Ivan: Now, the true history of Stark name will be written.\
\
Tony: Jarvis, where is he?\
\
Jarvis: Accessing the Oracle grid. Eastern Seaboard.\
\
Ivan: What your father did to my family over 40 years, I will do to you in 40 minutes.\
\
Tony: Sounds good. Let\'92s get together and hash it out.\
\
Jarvis: Tri-State area. Manhattan and outlying boroughs.\
\
Ivan: I hope you\'92re ready. [Call ends]\
\
Jarvis: Call trace incomplete.\
\
[Sees advert for Justin\'92s presentation. Picks up new arc reactor]\
\
Jarvis: Sir\
\
Tony: You want to run some tests, run them. And assemble the suit while you\'92re at it. Put it together now.\
\
Jarvis: We are unclear as to the effects.\
\
Tony: I don\'92t want to hear it Jarvis. [Reactor gains power] That tastes like coconut. And metal. Oh wow, yeah!\
\
[Stark Expo. Natasha opens the door for Pepper to exit the car]\
\
Happy: I\'92ll keep the car down here, all right?\
\
Pepper: Thank you Happy.\
\
Announcer: \'85Justin Hammer. His presentation will begin shortly in the main pavilion.\
\
[Begins. Justin dances on to the stage]\
\
Justin: Yeah. That\'92s what I\'92m talking about. Thanks for coming. Ladies and gentlemen, for far too long, this country has had to place its brave men and women in harm\'92s way, but then the Iron Man arrived, and we thought the days of losing lives were behind us. Sadly, that technology was kept out of reach. That\'92s not fair. That\'92s not right. And it\'92s just too bad.\
\
Pepper: Oh, Lord.\
\
Justin: Regardless, it was an impressive innovation, one that grabbed the headlines the world over. Well, today, my friends, the press is faced with quite a difficult problem. They are about to run out of ink. [Two people run on to remove the podium] Get that out of here. Ladies and gentlemen, today I present to you the new face of the United States military. The Hammer drone. [Drones rise out of the stage as he calls names] Army! Navy! Air Force! Marines! Yeah! Yeah! Woo! That\'92s a hell of a lot better than some cheerleaders, let me tell you. But as revolutionary as this technology is, there will always be a need for man to be present in the theatre of war [Ivan is typing something] Ladies and gentlemen, today I am proud to present to you the very first prototype in the Variable Threat Response Battle Suit and its pilot, Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes.\
\
Pepper: What? [Rises and salutes.]\
\
Justin: For America and its allies, Hammer Industries is reporting for\'85 [incoming Iron Man]\
\
Tony: We got trouble.\
\
Rhodey: Tony, there are civilians present. I\'92m here on orders. Let\'92s not do this right now.\
\
Tony: Give them a wave.\
\
Justin: Hey, all right. Yeah.\
\
Tony: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?\
\
Tony: Listen, I think he\'92s working with Vanko.\
\
Rhodey: Vanko\'92s alive?\
\
Justin: Yeah. [Tony approaches him]\
\
Tony: What is he?\
\
Justin: What?\
\
Tony: Where\'92s Vanko?\
\
Justin: Who?\
\
Tony: Tell me.\
\
Justin: What are you doing here man?\
\
Rhodey: Whoa, whoa, whoa.\
\
Tony: [As a large gun takes aim] Is that you?\
\
Rhodey: No, I\'92m not doing that. That\'92s not me. I can\'92t move. I\'92m locked up. I\'92m locked up! [Drones take aim] Get out of here. Go! This whole system\'92s been compromised.\
\
Tony: [Takes off] Let\'92s take it outside. [Drones and Rhodey fire at him. Rhodey takes off]\
\
Rhodey: No, no!\
\
Tony: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.\
\
Jarvis: Yes sir.\
\
Rhodey: Tony, Tony, I\'92m locked on. I have target lock.\
\
Tony: On what?\
\
Rhodey: On you. [Shooting at Tony] Tony, on your six!\
\
Justin: [Running to a computer] What\'92s going on? What\'92s happening?\
\
Technician: The software\'92s been overridden.\
\
Justin: What? What do you mean it\'92s been overridden? What does that mean?\
\
Technician: I think he slaved the drones.\
\
Justin: That\'92s impossible. Call the guards.\
\
Jack: All the phones are down sir.\
\
Justin: Well, then call their\'85 Call their cells.\
\
Jack: Their cell phones are not working either sir.\
\
Technician: He\'92s locked us out of the mainframe.\
\
Pepper: [Entering] Who\'92s locked you out of the mainframe?\
\
Justin: Please, please, go away. Go away. I\'92ve got this handled.\
\
Pepper: Have you now?\
\
Justin: Yes, I do. In fact, if your guy hadn\'92t showed up, this wouldn\'92t be happening. So, please, now go away. Thank you [To technician] Listen, we got to get these bitches out of here. What?\
\
Natasha: [Grabs Justin and holds him down on the desk] You tell me who\'92s behind this. Who\'92s behind this?\
\
Justin: Ivan. Ivan Vanko.\
\
Natasha: Where is he?\
\
Justin: At my facility.\
\
[Natasha lets go and leaves. Pepper dials a number on her phone]\
\
Pepper: I need NYPD, please.\
\
Justin: No, no, no!\
\
Pepper: Command Central.\
\
Justin: No, no, honey. Don\'92t call the authorities.\
\
Pepper: Okay. Right away. Right away. [To Justin] Step aside. Step aside. [To technician] Tell me everything you know. Go.\
\
[Tony is still being chased by Rhodey\'92s suit and the air force drones]\
\
Tony: How are we doing Jarvis?\
\
Jarvis: Remote reboot unsuccessful.\
\
[Other drones are now firing at the running crowds. Natasha leaves the building.]\
\
Security guard: This way.\
\
Happy: Nobody\'92s answering the phone. What\'92s going on?\
\
Natasha: Get in the car. Take me to Hammer Industries.\
\
Happy: I\'92m not taking you anywhere.\
\
Natasha: Fine. You want me to drive?\
\
Happy: No, I\'92m driving. Get in the car.\
\
[Lots of shooting drones and people screaming. The kid with the Iron Man helmet is targeted by a drone and holds his hand up. Tony lands behind him and shoots the drone with his hand repulsor]\
\
Tony: Nice work kid. [Takes off again]\
\
Rhodey: You got multiples coming in on you.\
\
Tony: Let\'92s get this away from the Expo.\
\
[Inside car]\
\
Natasha: Wen we arrive, I need you to watch the perimeter. [She\'92s getting undressed in the back of the car] I\'92m gonna enter the facility and take down the target. Watch the road.\
\
Happy: I got it. I got it.\
\
[Tony and Rhodey. Tony sets off one car alarm, the drones set off the rest.\
\
Ivan is still typing inside Hammer Industries]\
\
Rhodey: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They\'92re headed back to the Expo.\
\
Tony: Got it.\
\
Rhodey: In closing in on you. Ordnance coming in hot Tony. Watch it.\
\
[Hammer Industries. Happy parks the car outside. More of less]\
\
Natasha: Stay in the car.\
\
Happy: I\'92m not staying in the car.\
\
Natasha: I said, stay in the car.\
\
Happy: [As Natasha heads up the stairs to the front door] What are you wearing? Look, I\'92m not letting you go in there alone.\
\
Natasha: You want to help? Keep the car running.\
\
Happy: [Opens the door as she unlocks it and runs in] Okay.\
\
[Ivan gets a security breach message]\
\
Hammer security guard: Hey, hey, hey. You can\'92t come in here.\
\
[Happy punches him and Natasha heads past.]\
\
Second guard: Hold on. Hey!\
\
[Natasha fights the other guards. Some using her SHIELD tech, some just kicking or punching them.\
\
Back at Expo]\
\
Technician: Each set of drone is communicating in its own unique language.\
\
Pepper: Well, choose one and focus on that.\
\
Justin: Have you tried Russian? Why don\'92t you try Russian?\
\
[Hammer Industries. Happy is still fighting the same guard.]\
\
Announcement: Attention. We have intrusion on Grid W.\
\
Security guard: We got it. We\'92re on our way.\
\
[And Natasha throws something. And takes on like five guards at once. She walks away, casually spraying one with pepper spray. All this while Happy\'92s fighting one guy. Happy wins.]\
\
Happy: I got him! [Sees what Natasha has done\
\
Ivan gets up.\
\
Tony is trying to let the drones away]\
\
Tony: Rhodey, you still locked on?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah.\
\
Tony: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We\'92re about to get wet on this ride.\
\
Rhodey: Wait, wait, wait!\
\
[Tony leads the drones through the globe sculpture. Most explode hitting parts of it.\
\
Natasha kicks open Ivan\'92s door, a gun in each hand. Happy is behind her. The room is empty.]\
\
Natasha: He\'92s gone.\
\
[Tony and Rhodey]\
\
Tony: I\'92m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd. What\'92s your 20?\
\
[Directly above him. Both crash into biodome\
\
Natasha puts her guns on the table and starts typing.]\
\
Happy: What are you doing?\
\
Natasha: I\'92m rebooting Rhodey\'92s suit.\
\
[Rhodey is on top of Tony, who is pushing the gun to keep it from shooting him]\
\
Rhodey: Tony.\
\
[Natasha gains access.\
\
Rhodey\'92s suit shuts down]\
\
Natasha: Reboot complete [Image of Tony on screen] You got your best friend back.\
\
Tony: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.\
\
Natasha: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.\
\
Tony: Yes, for the moment, I\'92m not dying. Thank you.\
\
Pepper: [Image appears on second screen] What do you mean you\'92re not dying? Did you just say you\'92re dying?\
\
Tony: Is that you? No, I\'92m not. Not anymore. [Natasha looks confused.]\
\
Pepper: What\'92s going on?\
\
Tony: I was going to tell you. I didn\'92t want to alarm you.\
\
Pepper: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?\
\
Tony: You didn\'92t let me.\
\
Pepper: Why didn\'92t you tell me that?\
\
Tony: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.\
\
Natasha: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight\'92s coming to you.\
\
Tony: Great. Pepper?\
\
Pepper: Are you okay now?\
\
Tony: I am fine. Don\'92t be mad. I will formally apologise\'85\
\
Pepper: I am mad!\
\
Tony: \'85when I\'92m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.\
\
Pepper: Fine.\
\
Tony: We could have been in Venice.\
\
Pepper: Oh please.\
\
[Tony taps Rhodey\'92s helmet as the system restarts.]\
\
Tony: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They\'92re coming. Come on, let\'92s roll. Get up.\
\
Rhodey: [Helmet opens] Oh, man. You can have your suit back.\
\
Tony: [Helps him up] You okay?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I\'92m sorry, okay?\
\
Tony: Don\'92t be.\
\
Rhodey: No. I should have trusted you more.\
\
Tony: I\'92m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.\
\
Rhodey: No. It\'92s your fault. I just wanted to say I\'92m sorry.\
\
Tony: Thank you. That\'92s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They\'92re coming in hot, any second. What\'92s the play?\
\
Rhodey: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let\'92s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.\
\
Tony: Got you. Where do you want to be?\
\
Rhodey: Where are you going?\
\
Tony: What\'92re you talking about?\
\
Rhodey: I meant me.\
\
Tony: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.\
\
Rhodey: Tony, don\'92t be jealous.\
\
Tony: No. It\'92s subtle all the bells and whistles.\
\
Rhodey: Yeah. It\'92s called being a badass.\
\
Tony: Fine. All right. You go up to. I\'92ll draw them in.\
\
Rhodey: Don\'92t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.\
\
Tony: Okay, you got a spot. Where\'92s mine?\
\
Rhodey: It\'92s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. [Drones incoming. And Rhodey and Ton are still in the kill box. Helmets down. Shooting begins.]\
\
Tony: See that?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah, yeah. Nice.\
\
Tony: Rhodey? Get down. [Laser slices all the drones in half. And a tree.]\
\
Rhodey: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.\
\
Tony: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It\'92s a one-off.\
\
[Back inside Expo]\
\
Justin: I told you that five minutes ago.\
\
Pepper: [As police enter] That\'92s your guy here.\
\
Justin: Excuse me?\
\
Police officer: You\'92re being placed under arrest.\
\
Justin: Are you kidding me?\
\
Police officer: Hands behind your back sir.\
\
Justin: I\'92m trying to help here. I get it. I see what you\'92re doing. You\'92re trying to pin this on me, huh? That\'92s good. That\'92s good. You\'92re starting to think like a CEO, taking out the competition. I like that. You think you\'92re making a problem for me? [Being led away] I\'92m gonna make a problem for you. I\'92m gonna be seeing you again real soon.\
\
Pepper: [Now outside with some police officers] When they get here, I think you should station them at the south, east and both west exits.\
\
Police officer: We shut down the 7 train in and out of Willets Point already.\
\
Pepper: Well, have city buses there to ferry people to operating lines.\
\
Police officer: Yeah. Are you coming with us?\
\
Pepper: No, I\'92m gonna stay until to park is clear.\
\
Police officer: Okay.\
\
[Hammer Industries]\
\
Natasha: Head up. You got one more drone incoming. This one looks different. [Tony and Rhodey; Natasha on speaker] The repulsor signature is significantly higher.\
\
Ivan: [Landing in a full suit] Good to be back.\
\
Rhodey: This ain\'92t gonna be good. [Ivan\'92s whisps turn on] I got something special for this guy. I\'92m gonna bust his bunker with the Ex-Wife.\
\
Tony: With the what? [Rhodey shoots it and it bounces off Ivan, fizzling off in the water] Hammer tech?\
\
Rhodey: Yeah.\
\
Tony: I got this. [Targets points on Ivan\'92s armour. Doesn\'92t do much. Both shooting, fighting. Ends with both Tony and Rhodey held onto by Ivan\'92s whips] Rhodes. I got an idea. You want to be a hero?\
\
Rhodey: What?\
\
Tony: I could really use a sidekick. Put your hand up.\
\
Rhodey: This is your idea?\
\
Tony: Yep.\
\
Rhodey: I\'92m ready. I\'92m ready. Go, go, go!\
\
Tony: Take it! [Same as at the house, they shoot each other and the middle explodes. Unfortunately for Ivan, he is in the middle]\
\
Ivan: You lose. [Dies. Reactor starts flashing red. So do all the drones]\
\
Rhodey: All these drones are rigged to blow. We gotta get out of here man.\
\
Tony: Pepper? [Takes off. Pepper is by a drone. Tony grabs her just as it explodes. They land on a roof. Takes off helmet.]\
\
Pepper: Oh my God. I can\'92t take this anymore.\
\
Tony: You can\'92t?\
\
Pepper: I can\'92t take this.\
\
Tony: Look at me.\
\
Pepper: My body, literally, cannot handle the stress. I never know if you\'92re gonna kill yourself or wreak the whole company.\
\
Tony: I think I did okay. [Everything being on fire having been covered by exploding drones behind him. One more explosion. Just as he finishes speaking.]\
\
Pepper: I quit. I\'92m resigning. That\'92s it.\
\
Tony: What did you just say? You\'92re done? That\'92s surprising. No, it\'92s not surprising. I get it. You don\'92t have to make excuses.\
\
Pepper: I\'92m\'85 I\'92m\'85 I\'92m not making any excuses.\
\
Tony: You actually were just making excuses. But you don\'92t have to.\
\
Pepper: No, I wasn\'92t making an excuse. I\'92m actually very justified.\
\
Tony: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.\
\
Pepper: Well\'85\
\
Tony: You\'92ve taken such good care of me. I\'92ve been in a tough spot, but you got me through it, so\'85 Right?\
\
Pepper: Thank you.\
\
Tony: Yeah.\
\
Pepper: Thank you for understanding.\
\
Tony: Yeah, yeah. Let\'92s talk clean-up.\
\
Pepper: I\'92ll handle the transition. It\'92ll be smooth.\
\
Tony: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That\'92s gonna seem\'85\
\
Pepper: Well, with you it\'92s like dog years.\
\
Tony: I know.\
\
Pepper: I mean, it\'92s like the Presidency. [They kiss]\
\
Tony: Weird.\
\
Pepper: No, it\'92s not weird.\
\
Tony: It\'92s okay, right?\
\
Pepper: Yeah.\
\
Tony: Run that by me again. [They start to kiss again]\
\
Rhodey: I think it was weird. [They break apart and turn around] You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape.\
\
Pepper: I had just quit, actually.\
\
Tony: Yeah, so we\'92re not\'85\
\
Rhodey: You don\'92t have to do that. I heard the whole thing.\
\
Tony: You should get lost.\
\
Rhodey: I was here first. Get a roof.\
\
Tony: I thought you were out of one-liners.\
\
Rhodey: That\'92s the last one.\
\
Tony: You kicked ass back there, by the way.\
\
Rhodey: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I\'92m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay?\
\
Tony: Not okay. Not okay with that.\
\
Rhodey: It wasn\'92t a question. [Takes off]\
\
Tony: How are you gonna resign if I don\'92t accept?\
\
[Scene change. Some kind of building. Tony is inside sitting at a table. SHIELD logo is there.\
\
Picks up file. AVENGERS INITIATIVE PREMLIMIARY REPORT\
\
Nick Fury enters while looking and stops him opening it]\
\
Fury: I don\'92t think I want you looking at that. I\'92m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff\'92s assessment of you. Read it. [Hands Tony the file]\
\
Tony: \'93Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.\'94 In my own defence, that was last week. \'93Prone to self-destructive tendencies.\'94 I was dying. I mean, please. Aren\'92t we all? \'93Textbook narcissism\'94? Agreed. Okay, here it is. \'93Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.\'94 I gotta think about it.\
\
Fury: Read on.\
\
Tony: \'93Tony Stark not\'85 Not recommended\'94? That doesn\'92t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I\'92m trying to do right by Pepper. I\'92m in a stable-ish relationship. [Fury walks round and rest against the table by Tony\'92s chair]\
\
Fury: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we\'92d only like to use you as a consultant. [Tony stands and offers his hand. They shake]\
\
Tony: [Clasping his other hand on top of Fury\'92s] You can\'92t afford me. [Goes to leave, but turns around again] Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.\
\
Fury: I\'92ll see what I can do.\
\
[Scene change. Washington. ACDC\'92s Highway To Hell Starts to play]\
\
Stern: It is my honour to be here today to present these distinguished awards to Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes and Mr Tony Stark, who is, of course, a national treasure. [Pinning on medals] Thank you Lieutenant Colonel, for such and exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this.\
\
Rhodey: Thank you sir.\
\
Stern: Mr Stark. Thank you for such as exceptionally distinguished performance. You deserve this. [Tony winces in pain] Oh, sorry. Funny how annoying a little prick can be, isn\'92t it? Let\'92s get a photo.\
\
[Pose for a photo. Roll credits. Cue end credits scene. A car rolls up. Well-dressed shoes. Agent Coulson looks down on a crater. Takes off sunglasses and pulls out phone]\
Agent Coulson: Sir, we\'92ve found it.\
[Camera pans out and there seems to be a hammer. The End.]\
\
\
[Marvel Opening Credits]\
\
[Radio transmission sound]\
\
[The Marvel Studios Logo plays as usual but this time, at the end of that logo, the background changes from red to black and the I and O in "Studios" become 10 in red. The logo now reads "Marvel Studios". Throughout the logo, an Asgardian is reporting a distress signal.] Asgardian PA: This is the Asgardian refugee vessel Statesman. We are under assault, I repeat, we are under assault - The engines are dead, life support failing. Requesting aid from any vessel within range. We are 22 jump points out of Asgard. [The voice becomes more desperate and pleading] Our crew is made up of Asgardian families, we have very few soldiers here. This is not a warcraft. I repeat, this is not a warcraft! [The ship is being hit by missiles.]\
\
[Inside the ship, Ebony Maw walks among the bodies of dead Asgardians. Heimdall, badly wounded, reaches out as if he would stop Maw as he passes, but lacks the strength. Maw steps over them with no mind as he speaks, as if they were scattered pieces of dirty clothing on a bedroom floor.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You have had the privilege of being saved by the Great Titan.... You may think this is suffering... no. It is salvation. Universal scales tip toward balance because of your sacrifice. Smile... [Corvus Glaive stabs one of the lingering Asgardians] for even in death, you have become Children of Thanos.\
\
[Loki stands with the Black Order. He watches Thanos, shrouded in darkness and light, a vague silhouette.]\
\
Thanos: [Looking out the large window we saw at the end of Thor: Ragnarok] I know what it's like to lose. To feel so desperately that you're right... yet to fail, nonetheless. [Lifts Thor by the neck of his breastplate. Thor struggles feebly.] It's frightening. Turns the legs to jelly. I ask you, to what end? Dread it. Run from it. Destiny arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say... I AM.\
\
[Thanos holds up his hand to reveal the Infinity Gauntlet, which already hosts the violet Power Stone.]\
\
Thor: [Now being held by Thanos with one huge hand wrapping around his head; blood drools from his mouth] You talk too much.\
\
Thanos: [To Loki] The Tesseract, or your brother's head. I assume you have a preference.\
\
[The Black Order heft their weapons or smirks, as appropriate.]\
\
Loki: Oh, I do. Kill away!\
\
[Thanos' face expresses surprise briefly before presses the gauntlet to Thor's left temple. The Power Stone glows brightly. Thor screams hoarsely.]\
\
Loki: [Starts losing his cool demeanor almost immediately as Thor suffers, and breaks after only a few moments] ALL RIGHT, STOP!\
\
Thor: We don't have the Tesseract. It was destroyed on Asgard.\
\
[Loki glances at Thor like he knows something he doesn't. He lifts his right hand into the air and the Tesseract reveals itself.]\
\
Thor: You really are the worst brother.\
\
Loki: [While holding the Tesseract out to Thanos and advancing] I assure you, brother... the sun will shine on us again.\
\
Thanos: Your optimism is misplaced, Asgardian.\
\
Loki: Well, for one thing, I'm not Asgardian. And for another... we have a Hulk.\
\
[Thanos looks to his right just as a green and very angry mass slams into him. Loki dives for Thor, pulling both of them out of the way as the Tesseract skitters across the floor, and the Hulk charges Thanos. The Hulk pummels Thanos, forcing him backwards and shoving him into the wall of the ship. Maw stops Cull Obsidian from interfering.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Let him have his fun.\
\
[Thanos pries the Hulk's hands away; an expression of surprise and fear crosses his green face. After several hard blows, Thanos picks up the Hulk and slams him to the deck, defeated. Thor slams a metal bar across Thanos' back to no avail, is kicked across the deck by Thanos and is promptly bound in metal debris by Ebony Maw to keep him from interfering further.]\
\
Heimdall: [Prays] Allfathers\'85 let the dark magic flow through me one last... time.\
\
[Heimdall summons the Bifrost, which carries the Hulk away; he meets Thor's eye.]\
\
Thanos: That was a mistake.\
\
[Thanos borrows Corvus's glaive and stabs Heimdall through the heart, twisting the blade in the wound.]\
\
Thor: NO!!! [After Thanos kills Heimdall] You're going to die for that!\
\
Ebony Maw: [Shuts Thor's mouth with his telekinesis] Shh.\
\
Ebony Maw: [Kneels before Thanos, offering up the Tesseract] My humble personage\'85 bows before your grandeur. No other being has ever had the might, nay the nobility, to wield not one, but two Infinity Stones. The universe lies within your grasp.\
\
[Thanos crushes the Tesseract, revealing the blue Space Stone. He blows some of the fractals away, fingering the Stone between his thumb and index, before placing it on the gauntlet, and is momentarily rocked by the surge of energy that pulses as the stone seats in its setting.]\
\
Thanos: There are two more Stones on Earth. Find them, my children, and bring them to me on Titan.\
\
Proxima Midnight: [Kneeling] Father, we will not fail you.\
\
Cull Obsidian: We're going to New York City and We will tear The Avengers Apart and Smash! Once and for all, my lord.\
\
Loki: [Emerging from behind the Black Order] [cheerfully] If I might interject\'85 if you're going to Earth, you might want a guide. I do have a bit of experience in that arena.\
\
Thanos: [Unimpressed] If you consider failure experience.\
\
Loki: I consider experience, experience. Almighty Thanos, I... Loki... Prince of Asgard... [looks significantly at Thor] Odinson... the rightful King of Jotunheim... God of Mischief... do hereby pledge to you, my undying fidelity.\
\
[Thor squints and notices a dagger materialize in Loki's hand. Loki braces himself, thrusts upward with lightning speed and attempts to stab Thanos, but is frozen in place by the Space Stone's power before the point could strike home.]\
\
Thanos: "Undying?" You should choose your words more carefully.\
\
[Thanos twists the dagger out of Loki's hand with his right hand, then takes hold of Loki's neck with the gauntlet and lifts him to eye level. Loki struggles, kicking, as his throat is squeezed. He makes eye contact with Thor before he increases his force on Loki's neck.]\
\
Loki: [Giving up on fighting against Thanos] You will... never be... a god. [Thanos crushes Loki's neck, killing him.]\
\
Thor: [Muffled] NO!\
\
Thanos: [Walks over and drops Loki's body in front of Thor.] No resurrections this time.\
\
[Thanos raises the gauntlet, sends violet Power fire through the remains of the Statesman, and uses the Space Stone to teleport away with the Black Order.]\
\
Thor: No\'85 Loki\'85.\
\
[Thor is released from his bonds. He crawls over to Loki's body -- which, unlike in The Dark World, has not returned to its Jotun form -- and lays his head down on Loki's chest, shedding tears for all that he has lost. The ship explodes.]\
\
[The Bifrost continues its journey, bringing the Hulk across space to Earth.]\
\
[Sanctum Sanctorum, New York City]\
\
[Doctor Strange, Master of the Mystic Arts, proceeds down the main steps of the Sanctum with Wong.]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Dressed in casual American clothes.] Seriously? You don't have any money?\
\
Wong: [Dressed as Wong is always dressed.] Attachment to the material is detachment from the spiritual.\
\
Stephen Strange: I'll tell the guys at the deli. [Wryly] Maybe they'll make you a metaphysical ham on rye.\
\
Wong: Oh, wait, wait, wait, I think I have 200.\
\
Stephen Strange: Dollars?\
\
Wong: Rupees.\
\
Stephen Strange: Which is?\
\
Wong: Uh, buck and a half.\
\
Stephen Strange: What do you want?\
\
Wong: I wouldn't say no to a tuna melt.\
\
[Bruce crash-lands through the Sanctum stairs. The Cloak of Levitation swirls around Strange's shoulders immediately.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Thanos is coming. He's coming...\
\
Stephen Strange: [Sharing a look with Wong, and now fully in his mage attire] Who?\
\
[Title Screen: Avengers: Infinity War]\
\
[Public Park, New York City, day. Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk on having a conversation.]\
\
Tony Stark: Slow down, slow down. I'm totally not kidding.\
\
Pepper Potts: [Laughing slightly and talking over him] You're totally rambling.\
\
Tony Stark: [Also talking over her] No, I'm not.\
\
Pepper Potts: Lost me.\
\
Tony Stark: Look, you know how you're having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?\
\
Pepper Potts: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: Okay, and then you're like, 'Oh my god, there's no bathroom, what am I gonna do?', 'Oh! Someone's watching,' ''m gonna go in my pants.'\
\
Pepper Potts: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.\
\
Tony Stark: Yes.\
\
Pepper Potts: Yeah. Everybody has that.\
\
Tony Stark: Right! That's the point I'm trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?\
\
Pepper Potts: [Nodding in understanding] Right.\
\
Tony Stark: Morgan! Morgan.\
\
Pepper Potts: So you woke up, and thought that we were...\
\
Tony Stark: Expecting.\
\
Pepper Potts: Yeah.\
\
Tony Stark: [Becoming excited] Yes?\
\
Pepper Potts: [Shaking her head] No.\
\
Tony Stark: I had a dream about it. It was so real.\
\
Pepper Potts: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn't have done that.\
\
[Pepper unties his jacket sleeves and taps Tony's chest attachment.]\
\
Tony Stark: I'm glad you brought this up, 'cause it's nothing. It's just a housing unit for nano particles.\
\
Pepper Potts: It's not helping your case, OK?\
\
Tony Stark: No, no, it's an attachment, it's not a-\
\
Pepper Potts: [Insistently] You don't need that.\
\
Tony Stark: I know. I had the surgery. I'm just trying to protect us. The future uses, and that's it. Just in case there's a monster in the closet, instead of, you know...\
\
Pepper Potts: Shirts?\
\
Tony Stark: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.\
\
Pepper Potts: You should have shirts in your closet.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We're gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Win-stone. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.\
\
Pepper Potts: Yes.\
\
Tony Stark: I will. [Tony kisses Pepper.]\
\
[Doctor Strange comes through a portal.]\
\
Stephen Strange: Tony Stark, I'm Doctor Stephen Strange. I need you to come with me. Oh, uh, congratulations on the wedding, by the way.\
\
[Tony and Pepper are understandably shocked.]\
\
Tony Stark: I'm sorry, you giving out tickets or something?\
\
Stephen Strange:We need your help. Look, it's not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.\
\
Tony Stark: And who's "we"?\
\
Bruce Banner: [Emerges from behind Doctor Strange] Hey, Tony.\
\
Tony Stark: [Looking surprised] Bruce.\
\
Bruce Banner: Pepper.\
\
Pepper Potts: Hi.\
\
Tony Stark: You okay?\
\
[Bruce gives Tony a desperate hug, not answering. After everything he has been through, we understand.]\
\
[Back at the Sanctum Sanctorum.]\
\
Wong: [Using magic to show the universe and five out of six Infinity Stones.] From the dawn of the universe, there was nothing. Then, boom! The Big Bang sent six elemental crystals, hurtling across the virgin universe. These Infinity Stones each control an essential aspect of existence.\
\
Stephen Strange: [Each Stone lights up as Dr. Strange names them.] Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.\
\
[Dr. Strange opens the Eye of Agamotto, revealing the Time Stone emitting emerald light.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Very attentive] Tell me his name again.\
\
Bruce Banner: Thanos. He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets. He takes what he wants. He wipes out half the population. He sent Loki. The attack on New York. That's him.\
\
Tony Stark: [Speaking to himself] This is it... What's our timeline?\
\
Bruce Banner: No telling. He has the Power and Space Stones, that already makes him the strongest creature in the whole universe. If he gets his hands, on all six Stones, Tony...\
\
Stephen Strange: He can destroy life on a scale hitherto undreamt of.\
\
Tony Stark: [Leans against a cauldron, stretching like he's about to go for a run.] Did you seriously just say "hitherto undreamt of"?\
\
Stephen Strange: Are you seriously leaning on the Cauldron of the Cosmos?\
\
Tony Stark: Is that what this is.... ?\
\
[The Cloak of Levitation smacks Tony's arm, surprising him.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Looking offended] [Straightening himself] I'm going to allow that. If Thanos needs all six, why don't we just stick this one down the garbage disposal?\
\
Stephen Strange: No can do.\
\
Wong: We swore an oath to protect the Time Stone. With our lives.\
\
Tony Stark: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry's named a flavor after me, so....\
\
Stephen Strange: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.\
\
Tony Stark: It's not bad.\
\
Stephen Strange: A bit chalky.\
\
Wong: A Hunka-Hulka Burning Fudge is our favorite.\
\
Bruce Banner: That's a thing?\
\
Tony Stark: Whatever. Point is: things change.\
\
Stephen Strange: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.\
\
Tony Stark: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.\
\
Stephen Strange: Well, if we don't do our jobs.\
\
Tony Stark: [Slightly condescending] What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?\
\
Stephen Strange: [Completely calm] Protecting your reality, douchebag.\
\
[You seriously can't tell who's sarcasm is better.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Okay, guys, could we table this discussion right now? The fact is that we have this Stone. We know where it is. Vision is out there somewhere with the Mind Stone, and we have to find him now.\
\
Tony Stark: [Awkwardly] Yeah, that's the... thing.\
\
Bruce Banner: What do you mean?\
\
Tony Stark: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He's offline.\
\
Bruce Banner: What? Tony, you lost another super bot?\
\
Tony Stark: I didn't lose him. He's more than that. He's evolving.\
\
Stephen Strange: Who could find Vision, then?\
\
Tony Stark: [Quietly to himself] Shit. [To the other men in a normal tone] Probably Steve Rogers.\
\
Stephen Strange: [Sighing in exasperation] Oh, great.\
\
Tony Stark: Maybe. But... [Sighs]\
\
Bruce Banner: [Missing the events of the Avengers' Civil War] Call him.\
\
Tony Stark: It's not that easy. God, we haven't caught up in a spell, have we?\
\
Bruce Banner: No.\
\
Tony Stark: The Avengers broke up. We're toast.\
\
Bruce Banner: [Rather surprised and slightly let-down] Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?\
\
Tony Stark: Cap and I fell out hard. We're not on speaking terms.\
\
Bruce Banner: [Almost pleading] Tony, listen to me. Thor's gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter who you're talking to or not.\
\
[Tony hesitates, before pulling out the cellular phone Steve mailed him, muttering 'flip phone'. It seems as though he brings it everywhere, always ready to call his lost friend. Before clicking "Call", he pauses, distracted by an unusual rumbling.]\
\
Tony Stark: Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to be moving your hair, would you?\
\
Stephen Strange: [Looking up at his forelock fluttering] Not at the moment, no.\
\
[Tony looks at the Hulk-made opening through the ceiling and sees debris flying by outside. He exits the Sanctum through the front door and scans the chaotic surroundings, the camera shaking around in this following long take to illustrate the chaos -- people running and screaming in alarm, traffic becoming impossibly tangled, a litter-filled wind like a nor'easter's. A woman falls nearly at his feet and he helps her up.]\
\
Tony Stark: You okay?\
\
[The woman ignores him and runs away. A car crashes in on a pole behind Tony.]\
\
Tony Stark: Help him! Wong, Doc.\
\
Bruce Banner: Go! Got it!\
\
Tony Stark: [Putting on his sunglasses] F.R.I.D.A.Y., what am I looking at?\
\
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Not sure, I'm working on it.\
\
Tony Stark: Hey! You might wanna put that Time Stone in your back pocket, Doc!\
\
Stephen Strange: [Bands of spells are readied around his forearms] Might wanna use it.\
\
[A mechanical hum grows louder as Tony approaches the intersection. As he turns the corner, he sees a huge circular ship floating over Bleecker Street.]\
\
[On a school bus, the hairs on Peter Parker's arms stand up. He looks out the window and sees the ship.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Tapping his best friend in the seat in front of him] Ned, hey. I need you to cause a distraction.\
\
Ned Leeds: [Turns around and sees the spaceship] Holy shit! We're all gonna die! There's a spaceship!\
\
[Students scramble to the windows in the back to see the spaceship.]\
\
[Peter quickly slides on one of his Stark-made webshooters, and webs the emergency exit lever on the opposite side of the bus.]\
\
School Bus Driver, Stan Lee: What's the matter with you kids? You've never seen a spaceship before?\
\
[Peter jumps out the window, clinging to the side of the bus and pulling on his mask before leaping over the side of the bridge, shooting a web-line and swinging free. He makes his way hastily towards the ship.]\
\
Tony Stark: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.\
\
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Will do.\
\
[Doctor Strange throws the Winds of Watoomb over Bleeker Street, and winks at Tony. The dust clears. Tony is begrudgingly amused for a split second.]\
\
[Then Ebony Maw and Cull Obsidian exit the ship by transmat.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to...\
\
Tony Stark: [Echoing the familiarly defiant 2008 Tony Stark] I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.\
\
Ebony Maw: [Looks at Doctor Strange] Stonekeeper... [Gestures to Tony] Does this chattering animal speak for you?\
\
Stephen Strange: Certainly not. I speak for myself. [Magical shields are readied with his fists, stepping forward.] But you\'92re trespassing in this city and on this planet. [Wong emulates him.]\
\
Tony Stark: It means get lost, Squidward!\
\
Ebony Maw: He exhausts me.\
\
Cull Obsidian: [Two untranslated syllables]\
\
Ebony Maw: Bring me the Stone.\
\
Cull Obsidian: [Three untranslated syllables] [He drops his huge alien hammer and drags it along as he obeys his brethren.]\
\
Tony Stark: Banner, you want a piece?\
\
Bruce Banner: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?\
\
Tony Stark: That's right.\
\
[Bruce attempts to release the Hulk. Instead of Hulk coming out easily, the most that turns green is Bruce's neck.]\
\
Tony Stark: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.\
\
Bruce Banner: I just... I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.\
\
Tony Stark: Where's your guy?\
\
Bruce Banner: I don't know. We've sort been havin' a thing.\
\
Tony Stark: There's no time for a thing.\
\
Bruce Banner: I know.\
\
Tony Stark: [Points at the approaching Obsidian] That's the thing right there. Let's go.\
\
[Bruce gives out a loud grunt, but fails to release the Hulk. Doctor Strange stares at Tony and Bruce in disbelief.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Glances at Doctor Strange] Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards.\
\
Bruce Banner: Tony, I'm sorry. [Stammers] Either I can't or he won't--\
\
Tony Stark: It's okay. Hey, stand down. [to Wong] Keep an eye on him. Thank you.\
\
Wong: I have him.\
\
Bruce Banner: Damn it.\
\
[As Cull Obsidian approaches the team, Tony dons his nanotech Iron Man suit in the space of three steps. He grows a shield on one arm to protect himself, then grows a set of blasters that easily throw the Dwarf back to Maw, who gestures and deflects his massive companion into some cars.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Where'd that come from?\
\
Tony Stark: It's nano-tech. You like it? A little someth--\
\
[Ebony Maw creates a spike of earth that throws Iron Man far up, and attacks the rest of the team with uprooted trees and other debris. Wong summons the Shield of the Seraphim.]\
\
Stephen Strange: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won't be joining us....\
\
[Doctor Strange teleports Bruce to a nearby park along with half a taxi. Iron Man returns and joins the fight, pushing a car thrown by Maw back at him. Maw cuts it in half and lets the pieces fly past him, untouched.]\
\
Tony Stark: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.\
\
Stephen Strange: It stays with me.\
\
Tony Stark: Exactly. Bye.\
\
[Iron Man flies through Ebony Maw's obstacle course but is cut short by Cull Obsidian's hammer, sending him through a building and into the park at high speed, plowing into the ground and fetching up against a tree.]\
\
Bruce Banner: [Rushing over to Iron Man] Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? Bad?\
\
Tony Stark: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?\
\
Bruce Banner: I'm trying. He won't come out.\
\
[Cull Obsidian arrives at the park and throws his hammer at Bruce and Iron Man.]\
\
Tony Stark: Hammer. [Pushes Bruce out of the way.]\
\
[Iron Man's energy beam deflects off Cull Obsidian's shield, slicing down trees. Bruce barely evades one.]\
\
Bruce Banner: [Crawling out from under the branches. Desperate and confused] Come on, Hulk. What are you doing to me? [Starts slapping himself multiple times] Come out! Come out! Come out!\
\
Hulk: [Half of Bruce's face becomes the Hulk.] Nooooooo! [Bruce falls back exhausted into his tree.]\
\
Bruce Banner: What do you mean, "no"?!\
\
[Iron Man is knocked down by Obsidian, who is about to deliver a decisive blow, but the alien's hammer is easily caught by Spider-Man.]\
\
Peter Parker: Hey, man. What's up, Mr. Stark?\
\
Tony Stark: Kid, where'd you come from?\
\
Peter Parker: Field trip to MoMA.\
\
[Cull Obsidian grabs Spider-Man and throws him away.]\
\
Peter Parker: What is this guy's problem, Mr. Stark?\
\
Tony Stark: He's from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.\
\
[Wong and Doctor Strange fight Maw. Maw lifts several bricks from the ground and turns them into sharp points. He sends them towards Wong and Doctor Strange. The two make portals and boomerang them back towards Maw. Maw moves a car to protect himself, but one spike still hits his head, creating a cut. Angered, Maw uses a broken fire hydrant's water stream to knock Wong back several meters, rendering him unconscious.]\
\
[Doctor Strange snaps a whip of magical energy to bind Maw's hands and yanks, but Maw flies forward with the pull and pins Doctor Strange upside-down against a building, using the bricks to trap the Sorcerer Supreme.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Your powers are quaint. You must be popular with children.\
\
[Maw tries to grab the amulet holding the Time Stone but jerks back when it burns his hand.]\
\
Stephen Strange: It's a simple spell but quite unbreakable.\
\
Ebony Maw: [Vehemently] Then I'll take it off your corpse.\
\
[Maw pulls Doctor Strange away from the building and throws him to the ground. Doctor Strange starts the gestures to use the Eye of Agamotto, but utility cables first pin Doctor Strange's arms, interrupting the spell and closing the Eye, while another cable winds around his torso, then tightens around his throat.]\
\
Stephen Strange: You'll find... removing a dead man's spell... troublesome.\
\
Ebony Maw: You'll only wish you were dead. [Doctor Strange falls unconscious and to the ground; Maw raises a portion of street pavement to use as a carrier, but the Cloak of Levitation works its master loose of the cable spiral and flies Doctor Strange away.] NO!\
\
Tony Stark: [Still fighting Cull Obsidian, as Doctor Strange passes through the park.] Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.\
\
Peter Parker: On it!\
\
[Spider-Man chases Ebony Maw, floating speedily and upright on a small platform of burbling debris leaving a deep rut in the streets, who in turn chases the Cloak-driven Doctor Strange through Manhattan; Maw attacks him, throwing a Rocket Mortgage billboard at Spider-Man to be rid of him.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Untangles himself] Not cool!\
\
[Maw bends all the utility poles in the path of the fleeing Cloak, finally snagging the loyal garment and ripping it loose of its master. Spider-Man scoops up Doctor Strange before he hits the pavement, but before he can get away with the unconscious Doctor Strange, a cone of blue light starts pulling the mage inexorably upwards. Spider-Man grabs a light pole to anchor himself, but Maw uproots it, sending Doctor Strange, Cloak and teenager on their way to his ship.]\
\
Peter Parker: Uhhh, Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up!\
\
Tony Stark: Hang on, kid. [Cull Obsidian's hammer doubles as a claw, pinning Iron Man to the ground and shorting his suit. As Obsidian jumps towards Iron Man, blades ready to end this fight, he is sent through a portal instead. The alien turns and leaps to return the same way, but Wong closes it rapidly -- only Obsidian's severed hand makes it back to the park. Bruce kicks the hand away with a noise of disgust.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Iron Man shakes himself free of the Dwarf's weapon, now powerless.] Wong, you're invited to my wedding. [Iron Man begins to fly towards the large ship] Give me a little juice, F.R.I.D.A.Y. [Iron Man's foot thrusters morph together into a single larger jet and increase his speed considerably.]\
\
[Ebony Maw walks towards the controls of the ship, Doctor Strange's unconscious body floating face-down behind him, and prepares to leave Earth's atmosphere.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Still in pursuit of the ship and his protege.] Unlock 17-A. [A pod launches from the upstate Avengers headquarters and curves up to the accelerating circular ship.] Pete, you gotta let go. I'm gonna catch you.\
\
Peter Parker: But you said save the wizard! [Spider-Man, gasping from lack of oxygen, pulls off his mask] I can't breathe!\
\
Tony Stark: You're too high up. You're running out of air.\
\
Peter Parker: Yeah! That makes sense.\
\
[Peter passes out, free-falling, but not for long before the pod reaches him. It attaches itself to him, becoming the Iron Spider suit. Now being able to breathe, Spider-Man lands on a bottom part of the ship, standing up heroically.]\
\
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark, it smells like a new car in here!\
\
Tony Stark: Happy trails, kid. F.R.I.D.A.Y, send him home.\
\
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Yep.\
\
[A large parachute extends from the new suit, snatching Spider-Man free of the ship's hull and him spiraling back to Earth.]\
\
Peter Parker: OH, COME ON!\
\
[Iron Man latches onto the hull and cuts a hole to board the ship, looking for wherever Strange and Ebony Maw went.]\
\
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, incoming call from Miss Potts.\
\
Pepper Potts: [Sounding heavily worried] Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right? What's going on?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we might have to push our 8:30 res.\
\
Pepper Potts: Why?\
\
Tony Stark: [While looking at the ship around him] Just 'cause I'll... probably not make it back for a while.\
\
Pepper Potts: Tell me you're not on that ship.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
\
Pepper Potts: God, no. Please tell me you're not on that ship.\
\
Tony Stark: Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I don't know what to say.\
\
Pepper Potts: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God\'85.\
\
Tony Stark: Pep\'85.\
\
Pepper Potts: Come back here right now! Come back!\
\
F.R.I.D.A.Y.: Boss, we're losing her. I'm going, too\'85.\
\
[Spider-Man is revealed to have managed to shoot a web to the outside of the ship, foiling his parachute, and clambers inside a slowly-closing chamber.]\
\
Peter Parker: Oh my God! [Looks at the rapidly-receding planet behind him] I should have stayed on the bus....\
\
[Ebony Maw, hands engaged in the ship's steering mechanism, accelerates into hyperspace.]\
\
[Meanwhile, back in New York]\
\
[Bruce finds Tony's flip-phone in the debris on the street and picks it up thoughtfully. Wong opens up a portal back to the Sanctum.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Where you going?\
\
Wong: The Time Stone's been taken. The Sanctum remains unguarded. What will you do?\
\
Bruce Banner: [Holding Rogers' cell phone] I'm gonna make a call.\
\
[Wong nods in understanding and closes the portal, not to be seen again for the rest of the movie. Banner holds Steve Rogers' cell phone and makes a call.]\
\
[Screen title: SPACE]\
\
[Camera pans around a brightly colored planet with ice rings to the Benatar. The Guardians of the Galaxy are travelling to investigate a distress call to the tune of "Rubberband Man".]\
\
Peter Quill: [Chair-dancing to the song] Sing it, Drax!\
\
[Drax is snoring with his mouth open from his seat in front of Quill. Gamora lip-syncs with the song along with Quill.]\
\
Rocket: [Yawns] Why are we doing this again?\
\
Gamora: [Annoyed] It's a distress signal, Rocket. Someone could be dying.\
\
Rocket: I get that, but why are we doing it?\
\
Peter Quill: 'Cause we're nice. And maybe whoever it is will give us a little cheddar cheese [Quill rubs his thumb against his other fingers] for our help.\
\
Gamora: [Waves her index finger at Quill] Which isn't the point.\
\
Peter Quill: [Points back at Gamora] Which isn't the point... I mean\'85 if he doesn't pony up\'85.\
\
Drax: We'll take his ship.\
\
Rocket: Exactly!\
\
Peter Quill: B-b-b-bingo!\
\
[Gamora looks up at Quill in concern. Quill returns her look and grimaces a "don't worry about it" expression at her.]\
\
Mantis: [Reading her console] We are arriving.\
\
Peter Quill: All right, Guardians. Don't forget, this might be dangerous, so let's put on our mean faces. [Groot rolls his eyes as Mantis makes a snarl. Groot's handheld Terran-vintage video game beeps.] Groot, put that thing away. Now. I don't wanna tell you again. [Game continues beeping] Groot.\
\
Groot: [In a mocking tone] I am Groot! (Translation: Shut up, bitch!)\
\
Peter Quill: Whoa!\
\
Rocket: Language!\
\
Gamora: Hey!\
\
Drax: Wow.\
\
Peter Quill: You got some acorns on you, kid.\
\
Rocket: Ever since you got a little sap, you're a total d-hole. Keep it up, and I'm gonna SMASH THAT THING TO PIECES!\
\
[Groot rolls his eyes.]\
\
[The Benatar decelerates, and Thanos' devastation suddenly covers the Guardians' field of view, revealing the distress signal to be the one from the Asgardian vessel at the beginning of the movie. Bodies are seen floating dead in space along with the pieces of the shredded ship.]\
\
Mantis: What happened?\
\
Rocket: Looks like we're not getting paid.\
\
[With a thump, Thor's body is plastered to the hull of the ship.]\
\
Rocket: [Waving his hands] Wipers! Wipers! Get it off!\
\
[Thor\'92s eye opens; all gasp.]\
\
[Cut to the Guardians settling the still-unconscious Thor onto an examination table.]\
\
Peter Quill: How the hell is this dude still alive?\
\
Drax: [Sounding awed] He is not a dude. You're a dude. This... this is a man. A handsome, muscular man.\
\
Peter Quill: [A little dented] I'm muscular.\
\
Rocket: Who are you kidding, Quill? You're one sandwich away from fat.\
\
Peter Quill: Yeah, right.\
\
Drax: It's true. You have gained a little weight\'85. [Drax motions to his chin and belly.]\
\
[Gamora leaves Quill's side at Thor's right, and circles around the foot of the table.]\
\
Peter Quill: What? Gamora, do you think I'm\'85\
\
Mantis: He is anxious. Angry. He feels tremendous loss and guilt.\
\
Drax: It's like a pirate had a baby with an angel.\
\
Peter Quill: Wow. This is a real wake-up call for me. Okay. I'm gonna get a Bow-flex. I'm gonna commit. I'm gonna get some dumbbells.\
\
Rocket: You know you can't eat dumbbells, right?\
\
Gamora: [Reaches Drax's side and picks up Thor's left arm, stroking his triceps] It's like his muscles are made of Cotati metal fibers.\
\
Peter Quill: [Snidely to Gamora] Stop massaging his muscles. [Gamora, annoyed, drops the arm with a thump; quietly to Mantis] Wake him up.\
\
Mantis: [Places hand on Thor's forehead] Wake.\
\
[Thor awakens, sitting up violently and throwing himself off the table to stumble a few steps away, then turning to see his hosts all pointing their weapons of choice at him; Groot is still playing his game.]\
\
Thor: Who the hell are you guys?\
\
[Cut to later as the Guardians stand around Thor eating soup.]\
\
Gamora: The entire time I knew Thanos, he only ever had one goal: To bring balance to the Universe by wiping out half of all life. He used to kill people planet by planet, massacre by massacre....\
\
Drax: Including my own.\
\
Gamora: If he gets all six Infinity Stones, he can do it with the snap of his fingers, like this. [She snaps her fingers.]\
\
Thor: You seem to know a great deal about Thanos.\
\
Drax: Gamora... is the daughter of Thanos.\
\
Thor: Your father killed my brother. [Thor stands and strides towards Gamora aggressively.]\
\
Peter Quill: Oh, boy. Stepfather. Technically, she hates him as much as you do. [Thor softens a bit.]\
\
Thor: Families can be tough. [He claps a hand on Gamora's shoulder] Before my father died, he told me I had a half-sister... that he imprisoned in Hel. Then she returned home, and stabbed me in the eye, so... I had to kill her. It's life, isn't it, I guess. Goes round and round and... I feel your pain.\
\
[Peter glares at Thor's hand on Gamora's shoulder, on the verge of full snarl, and moves around her to push between her and Thor.]\
\
Peter Quill: And I feel your pain, as well. I mean it's not a competition, but I've been through a lot. My father killed my mother, then I had to kill my father. And that was hard. Probably even harder than having to kill a sister. Plus, I, came out of it with both of my eyes--\
\
Thor: [Not paying attention as he stares at his soup spoon] I need a hammer, not a spoon\'85. (He attempts to fiddle with machinery) How do I open this thing? Is there some sort of a four-digit code maybe\'85 maybe a birth date or something\'85.\
\
Peter Quill: What are you doing?\
\
Thor: Taking your pod.\
\
Peter Quill: [Clears his throat then deepens his voice] No, you're not! [Mimics Thor\'92s accent] You'll not, be taking our pod today, sir.\
\
Rocket: Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?\
\
Peter Quill: No.\
\
Drax: You are. You're imitating the god-man. It's weird.\
\
Peter Quill: No I'm not.\
\
Mantis: [Gasp] He just did it again!\
\
Peter Quill: This is my voice!\
\
Thor: [Steps closer to Quill] Are you mocking me?\
\
Peter Quill: Are you mocking me?\
\
Thor: Stop it. You did it again.\
\
Peter Quill: He's trying to copy me.\
\
Thor: Would you stop doing that? He's doing it first.\
\
Gamora: Enough! We need to stop Thanos. Which means we need to find out where he's going next.\
\
Thor: Knowhere.\
\
Mantis: He must be going somewhere.\
\
Peter Quill: [Voice now normal] No. Knowhere? It's a place. We've been there. It sucks. Excuse me, that's our food. [To Thor as he rummages through their food stores.]\
\
Thor: Not anymore.\
\
Gamora: Thor\'85 why would he go to Knowhere?\
\
Thor: Because for years, the Reality Stone has been safely stored, there with a man we call the Collector.\
\
Peter Quill: If it's with the Collector, then it's not safe. Only an idiot would give that man a stone.\
\
Thor: Or a genius.\
\
Gamora: [To Thor] How do you know he's not going for one of the other Stones?\
\
Thor: There's six stones out there. [Finishes rummaging and steps in front of Gamora] Thanos already has the Power Stone because he stole it last week, when he decimated Xandar. He stole the Space Stone from me when he destroyed my ship and slaughtered half my people. The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth. They're with the Avengers.\
\
Peter Quill: The 'Avengers'?\
\
Thor: [By way of explanation.] Earth's Mightiest Heroes.\
\
Mantis: Like Kevin Bacon?\
\
Thor: [Pause] He may be on the team. I don't know. Haven't been there in a while. As for the Soul Stone, well, no one's ever seen that. No one even knows where it is. Therefore, Thanos can't get it. Therefore, he's going to Knowhere. Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone. You're welcome.\
\
Gamora: Then we have to go to Knowhere now.\
\
Thor: Wrong! Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.\
\
Drax: That's a made up word.\
\
Thor: All words are made up.\
\
[It's official: mind blown.]\
\
Rocket: Hold up, Nidavellir is real? [Climbing on to the table] Seriously? I mean, that place is a legend. [Increasingly gleeful] They make the most powerful, horrific weapons to ever torment the Universe. I would very much like to go there, please.\
\
Thor: The rabbit is correct, and clearly the smartest among you.\
\
Rocket: Rabbit?\
\
Thor: Only Eitri the dwarf king can make me the weapon I need. [To Rocket] I assume you're the captain, sir?\
\
Rocket: You're very perceptive.\
\
Thor: You seem like a noble leader. Will you join me on my quest to Nidavellir?\
\
Rocket: Lemme just ask the captain. Oh, wait a second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.\
\
Thor: Wonderful.\
\
Peter Quill: Except for that I'm the captain.\
\
Thor: Quiet!\
\
Peter Quill: That's my backpack.\
\
Rocket: Go sit down.\
\
Peter Quill: [To Thor] Look, this is my ship. And I'm not goin' to\'85 [gropes for "Nidavellir"] Wait, what kind of weapon are we talking about here?\
\
Thor: The Thanos killing kind.\
\
Peter Quill: Don't you think that we should all have a weapon like that?\
\
Thor: No. You simply lack the strength to wield them. Your bodies will crumble as your minds collapse into the madness.\
\
Rocket: Is it weird that I wanna do it even more now?\
\
Thor: A little bit. Yeah.\
\
Gamora: If we don't go to Knowhere and Thanos retrieves another stone, he'll be too powerful to stop.\
\
Thor: He already is.\
\
Rocket: I got it figured out. We got two ships, and a large assortment of morons. So me and Groot will go with the pirate-angel here, and the morons will go to Knowhere to try and stop Thanos. Cool? Cool.\
\
Thor: So cool. [Smiles a big grin.]\
\
Peter Quill: [To Rocket] For the record\'85 I know that you're only going with him because it's where Thanos isn't.\
\
Rocket: You know, you shouldn't talk that way to your captain, Quill. [As he enters the pod] Come on, Groot. Put that game down, you'll rot your brain.\
\
Thor: I bid you farewell and good luck, morons. Bye.\
\
[The Guardians nod or wave farewell as Thor, Rocket and Groot depart. Cut to Scotland, where Vision and Wanda Maximoff are sharing a room. Wanda is in bed while Vision, in a human glamour, watches out a window.]\
\
[High-pitched trilling]\
\
Vision: [Gasps and holds his hand to the Mind Stone in pain.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Vis? Is it the stone again?\
\
Vision: It's as if it's speaking to me.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: What does it say?\
\
Vision: I don't... I don't know. But something... \
\
[The stone trills again and Vision flinches. Wanda takes his face in her hands. Vision turns his head so he can kiss her left palm, then presses Wanda's hand to the Mind Stone.]\
\
Vision: Tell me what you feel.\
\
[Wanda gestures, her hand emanating her red swirling energy. She seems confused.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: I just feel you.\
\
[They kiss. Cut to later, where the two are going on a stroll.]\
\
 Wanda Maximoff: So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow to give us more time together before you went back.\
\
Vision: What if I miss that train?\
\
Wanda Maximoff: There is an 11.\
\
Vision: What if I missed all the trains? What if this time, I didn't go back?\
\
Wanda Maximoff: You gave Stark your word.\
\
Vision: I'd rather give it to you.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: There are people who are expecting me too, you know. We both made promises.\
\
Vision: Not to each other. [He puts his hands on her shoulders] Wanda\'85 for two years, we've stolen these moments, trying to see if this could work. And... I don't know. [Stammers] You know what, I'm just gonna speak for myself -- I, I... I think...\
\
Wanda Maximoff: It works.\
\
Vision: It works.\
\
Vision: Then stay. Stay with me.\
\
[Wanda looks down, but then her eyes and attention drift to her left.]\
\
Vision: [Suddenly very uncertain] Or not. If I'm overstepping\'85\
\
[Wanda steps over to a better view of the TV in the kebab shop at which they had stopped, drawing Vision with her. It shows coverage of the invasion of New York, the alien antagonists, and the disappearance of Tony Stark.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: [Fearful] What are they?\
\
Vision: What the stone was warning me about. [He kisses her hand] I have to go.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: No, Vision. Vision, if that's true\'85 then maybe going isn't the best idea.\
\
Vision: Wanda, I\'85 [Corvus Glaive appears suddenly behind Vision, stabbing him through the back. Vision screams, loses his glamour to return to his green, red and gold appearance, and is thrown down into the street.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Vision! [She circles her hands, gathering up energy for a counterattack when Proxima Midnight blasts her from behind, knocking the Scarlet Witch across the street and through a bistro's window.]\
\
[Corvus Glaive pins Vision down and digs the point of his high-tech glaive into Vision's forehead in an attempt to extract the Mind Stone.]\
\
[The Scarlet Witch commits her own surprise attack, blasts both of the aliens away, then lifts Vision and herself into a nearby courtyard, from where the Scarlet Witch drags him to rest in a concealed alleyway.]\
\
Vision: The blade. It stopped me from phasing.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Is that even possible?\
\
Vision: It isn't supposed to be. [His voice distorts electronically] My systems are failing. [The Scarlet Witch gestures over his gaping wound, using her magic to knit him back together. Vision continues in a gasping, wry tone] I'm beginning to think... we should have stayed in bed.\
\
[Corvus Glaive suddenly arrives, knocking the Scarlet aside and grabbing Vision into the air,]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Vis!\
\
[Corvus flies away with Vision, slamming him against several walls. Meanwhile, Proxima engages the Scarlet Witch with her staff weapon and they too begin to fight.]\
\
Corvus Glaive: [To Vision] Give up the Stone, and she lives.\
\
[Vision flies with Corvus to the roof of what appears to be a church, ricocheting off the stone church tower and onto the metal-clad roof.]\
\
[Simultaneously, Proxima and the Scarlet Witch fight below, staff weapon versus magic energy hands until Proxima uses the blaster effect of her weapon to knock the Scarlet Witch meters away, stunning her as Proxima leaps down, brandishing her weapon within bare inches of the Scarlet Witch's face, only held back by the Scarlet Witch's powers]\
\
[Furiously, Vision pummels Corvus, then throws him across the roof, firing a beam from the Mind Stone. Corvus uses his glaive to deflect the beam, splitting it into several beams, cutting up Edinburgh's ancient stone like butter, until one branch finally reflects back at Vision, slamming him into the wall behind him.]\
\
[Down below, the Scarlet Witch has blocked Proxima's staff once again when she hears an agonized cry from Vision. Desperation strengthens her to throw Proxima through the burning lorry sliced in half by the split Stone beam, stunning the alien. The Scarlet Witch then flies up to the roof where Glaive has pinned Vision and is again attempting to remove the Mind Stone.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Hands off.\
\
[The Scarlet Witch casts a bolt of magic which throws Corvus back through the wall and down a shaft, then flies the two of them away again. Proxima, who has recovered, shoots a bolt from her weapon, causing them to fall from the air and down through the roof of Edinburgh Waverley Train Station. Wanda crawls over to Vision, who cannot muster the strength to stand.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: [Hushed voice, pleading.] Come on. Come on. Come on, you gotta get up. You gotta get up. Come on. Hey. Hey. We have to go.\
\
Vision: Please. Please leave.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: You asked me to stay.... I'm staying.\
\
Vision: Please.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Get up.\
\
[Behind them, Proxima and Corvus crash through the roof and advance on them, brandishing their weapons. the Scarlet Witch moves protectively in front of Vision, building power in her hands.]\
\
[An express train passes behind Wanda, and Proxima cocks her head as if aware of another's presence. Confused, the Scarlet Witch also turns and looks over her left shoulder. As the last train car passes, we see a silhouette on the far side of the platform. Proxima throws her weapon at the shadowy figure, but it is deftly caught just before the figure steps from the shadows.]\
\
[As the Avengers theme kicks in, we now recognize a bearded and furious Steve Rogers (Captain America) as he steps into the light. Vision and the Scarlet Witch look hopeful and relieved. While all parties are distracted, Sam Wilson (Falcon) swoops in and kicks Proxima across the platform and through the closed cafe's security gate and furniture. Swooping around, he fires on Corvus.]\
\
[At the same time, Captain America throws Proxima's weapon to Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) who engages Corvus, ducking under his swing, stabbing him in the gut and executing a flying kick to knock him backwards.]\
\
[Proxima, who has rushed back to the fight, summons her weapon back to her hand and attacks Black Widow. Captain America leaps forward, rolls, scoops up Corvus's dropped glaive and holds her off. Black Widow joins in with her own escrima sticks. While the three are fighting, Falcon returns and again kicks Proxima backwards; she scuttles over to the prone Corvus. Falcon draws both of his Steyr SPP submachine pistols on the couple.]\
\
Proxima Midnight: [To Glaive] Get up.\
\
Corvus Glaive: I can't.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: [Coolly] We don't wanna kill you. But we will.\
\
Proxima Midnight: You'll never get the chance again.\
\
[Proxima Midnight and Corvus Glaive depart as they are beamed up. The glaive is snatched from Captain America's hand as well.]\
\
Sam Wilson: [To Vision] Can you stand?\
\
Vision: [Electricity shimmers over his surface, and his voice distorts] Thank you, Captain.\
\
Steve Rogers: [Nods] Let's get you on the jet.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: [Closing the doors to the Quinjet, while addressing Wanda] I thought we had a deal. Stay close, check in. Don't take any chances.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: I'm sorry. We just wanted time.\
\
Sam Wilson: Where to, Cap?\
\
Steve Rogers: Home.\
\
[Cut to the past, at Gamora's home planet Zen-Whoberi during Thanos' massacre. Gamora and her mother are hiding; the sounds of guns and screaming are outside.] \
\
Gamora's Mother: [To Young Gamora] Shh. We'll be safe. We'll be safe.\
\
[An explosion goes off close by and Gamora screeches by reflex, revealing their hiding spot.]\
\
Child of Thanos: [Untranslated inquiry.]\
\
[The door is smashed open and both Zehobereians scream.]\
\
[Outside, it is utter chaos. Leviathans, Chitauri chariots and ring-ships fly overhead; explosions and energy bolts from numerous sources criss-cross the panicked population, felling them randomly; smoke arises from countless fires.]\
\
Ebony Maw:  Zehobereians\'85\
\
Young Gamora: [Being dragged by one arm through the crowds] Mother! Where's my mother?!\
\
Ebony Maw: Zen-Whoberis... Choose a side, or die.\
\
Young Gamora: Mother! [She punches at the arm of the one dragging her who surprisingly drops her arm and leaves.]\
\
Ebony Maw: One side is a revelation. The other, an honor known only to a few.\
\
[Gamora turns and finds herself facing Thanos in his full Titan armor.]\
\
Thanos: What's wrong, little one?\
\
Young Gamora: My mother. Where is my mother?\
\
Thanos: [Kneels down to Gamora] What's your name?\
\
Young Gamora: Gamora.\
\
Thanos: You're quite the fighter, Gamora. Come. Let me help you. [Thanos offers his hand; she wraps her little fingers around one massive finger, and he leads her to a pavilion, where he crouches to her eye level again and produces a small -- for him -- red-jeweled handle. Pressing the switch, razor-sharp blades pop out both ends.] Look. Pretty, isn't it? Perfectly balanced. As all things should be. Too much to one side, or the other\'85 [He balances it on one finger, overbalances it purposefully and catches it.] Here. You try.\
\
[Thanos hands Gamora the dagger -- the handle is two child-palms' widths in length. She tries balancing it on her index finger.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Now go in peace, and meet your Maker.\
\
[One half of the crowd is shot down. The survivors scream in horror, and Gamora tries to turn but Thanos prevents her from seeing the massacre.]\
\
Thanos: Concentrate. There! You've got it.\
\
[Cut to the present, aboard the GUARDIANS\'92 ship. Gamora is brooding, activates the spring-action blades on the same dagger.]\
\
Peter Quill: Gamora. Do you know if these grenades are the "blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind? 'Cause I was thinking I might hang a couple on my belt right here. But I don't want to--\
\
Gamora: I need to ask a favor.\
\
Peter Quill: Yeah, sure.\
\
Gamora: One way or another, the path that we're on leads to Thanos.\
\
Peter Quill: Which is what the grenades are for. [Gamora silences him with a look.] I'm sorry. What's the favor?\
\
Gamora: If things go wrong\'85 If Thanos gets me\'85 I want you to promise me\'85 you'll kill me.\
\
Peter Quill: [A beat. Confusion.] What?\
\
Gamora: I know something he doesn't. If he finds out\'85 the entire Universe could be at risk.\
\
Peter Quill:  What do you know?\
\
Gamora: If I tell you, you'd know, too.\
\
Peter Quill: If it's so important, shouldn't I?\
\
Gamora: Only if you wanna die.\
\
Peter Quill: Why does somebody always have to die in this scenario?\
\
Gamora: Just\'85 trust me. And possibly, kill me.\
\
Peter Quill: I mean, I'd like to. I really would\'85 [Gamora silences him by covering his mouth with her hand.]\
\
Gamora: Swear to me. Swear to me on your mother.\
\
Peter Quill: [A beat. One that rests with him significantly.] Okay.\
\
[The two kiss, until an odd crunching sound startles them. Drax is standing in the corner.]\
\
Peter Quill: Dude. How long have you been standing there?\
\
Drax: An hour.\
\
Peter Quill: An hour? Are you serious?\
\
Drax: I've mastered the ability of standing so incredibly still... that I become invisible to the eye... watch.\
\
[Drax stands motionless, then very slowly raises his hand towards his mouth]\
\
Peter Quill: You're eating a zarg-nut.\
\
Drax: But my movement... was so slow... that it's imperceptible.\
\
Peter Quill: Mmm, no. [Quill and Gamora shake their heads.]\
\
Drax: I'm sure I'm invisible.\
\
Mantis: Hi, Drax.\
\
Drax: [Knowing when he is beat] Damn it.\
\
[The Benatar flies towards a massive skull and flies through one eye-hole into a vast interior cavern. Screen title: KNOWHERE.]\
\
Peter Quill: This place looks deserted.\
\
Drax: I'm reading movement from the third quadrant.\
\
Peter Quill: Yep. I'm picking that up, too. Let's put it down right here.\
\
[The four Guardians disembark and sneak into the Collector\'92s collection room, which is in ruins. Thanos is threatening the Collector while the Guardians hide behind rubble.]\
\
Collector: I don't have it.\
\
Thanos: Everyone in the Galaxy knows you'd sell your own brother if you thought it would add the slightest trinket to your pathetic collection.\
\
[Quill stops, and holds up a fist meaning 'halt' in the silent language of soldiers. Everybody walks quietly past him.]\
\
Thanos: I know you have the Reality Stone, Tivan. Giving it to me will spare you a great deal of suffering. [Thanos places a heavy boot on the middle of the Collector's chest and presses.]\
\
Collector: [Strained] I told you. I sold it. Why would I lie?\
\
Thanos: I imagine it's like breathing for you.\
\
Collector: Like suicide.\
\
Thanos: So you do understand. Not even you would surrender something so precious.\
\
Collector: I didn't know what it was.\
\
Thanos: Then you're more of a fool than I took you for. Last chance, charlatan. Where's the Stone?\
\
Drax: Today...\
\
Peter Quill: [Grasping the danger] Drax. Drax.\
\
Drax: ...He pays for the deaths of my wife and daughter.\
\
Peter Quill: Drax, waaaaait! [Drax draws his long dagger from his leg scabbard.] Not yet, not yet, not yet. [Drax gives him a look and heads towards Thanos. Quill hurries as quietly as possible to catch up.] Drax, Drax, Drax. He doesn't have the Stone yet. We get it, and then we can stop him. We have to get the Stone first. Yeah.\
\
Drax: No. No. For Ovette. For Camaria.\
\
[Quill starts to struggle with Drax when Mantis puts her hand on the back of Drax's head.]\
\
Mantis: Sleeeep. [Drax is knocked out, his falling body causing a loud crash. Everybody ducks.]\
\
[Thanos looks towards the sound, then picks up the Collector and throws him into a collecting case before walking towards the disturbance.]\
\
Peter Quill: Okay. Gamora, Mantis, you go right. I'm... [Gamora moves towards Thanos] The other right!\
\
[Gamora leaps on Thanos from a stack of boxes, swinging her sword at him. He snaps the sword-blade in half, and Gamora stabs him in the throat with the stub, his lower jaw sagging and himself letting out a hoarse groan, then he is stabbed in the chest with the red-jeweled dagger.]\
\
Thanos: Why? [He falls down] Why you? Daughter\'85 [He holds his hand out to her, blood pooling out from his neck wound, before collapsing completely. Gamora breaks down, sobbing.]\
\
Peter Quill: [Surprised] That was quick.\
\
Collector: Magnificent! Magnificent! Magnificent!\
\
[Suddenly, Thanos' disembodied voice fills the room.]\
\
Thanos: Is it sadness I sense in you, daughter? In my heart, I knew you still cared. But one ever knows for sure. Reality is often disappointing.\
\
[The scene disappears -- everything in the room is destroyed and/or on fire, the Collector waving bye-bye as he and his case vanish.]\
\
Thanos: That is, it was. Now\'85 reality can be whatever I want.\
\
[Thanos is quite alive and undamaged. He has the red Reality Stone seated in the Infinity Gauntlet.]\
\
Gamora: [Her face still wet, but no longer crying] You knew I'd come.\
\
Thanos: I counted on it. There's something we need to discuss, little one.\
\
[Gamora hesitates for a beat, then reaches for her broken sword. Thanos grabs her by the back of the neck and swings her around in front of him.]\
\
Drax: Thanos!\
\
[With a pulse of the Reality Stone, both Drax and Mantis are 'disassembled' -- Drax is turned into a stack of tumbling cubes, and Mantis becomes a ribbon version of herself.]\
\
Peter Quill: [Moving in, his blaster pointed right at Thanos] Let her go, Grimace!\
\
Gamora: Peter\'85\
\
Peter Quill: [To Gamora] I told you to go right.\
\
Gamora: Now? Really?\
\
Peter Quill: You let her go!\
\
Thanos: Ah, the boyfriend.\
\
Peter Quill: I like to think of myself more as a Titan-killing long-term booty call. Let her go.\
\
Gamora: Peter\'85\
\
Peter Quill: Or I'm gonna blow that nut sack of a chin right off your face!\
\
Gamora: Not him.\
\
[Quill hesitates. He does not shoot anyone.]\
\
Gamora: You promised! You promised.\
\
Thanos: Oh, daughter. You expect too much from him. [to Quill] She's asked, hasn't she? Do it. [There is a very tense and unpleasant pause. Thanos rolls his head and shoves Gamora towards Quill\'92s gun, egging him on.] DO IT!!\
\
Peter Quill: [Tearing up] I told you to go right.\
\
Gamora: I love you, more than anything.\
\
Peter Quill: I love you, too.\
\
[Quill screws up his eyes and pulls the trigger -- but a stream of bubbles comes out. Thanos was playing him.]\
\
Thanos: [Genuinely sincere] I like you.\
\
[Thanos teleports Gamora and himself away as a stunned Quill picks up Gamora's sword, and his friends painfully re-assemble themselves, the Reality Stone's effects now subsiding in its absence.]\
\
(Back on Earth, the Quinjet arrives at the upstate New York Avengers HQ while Col. James "Rhodey" Rhodes deals with the red tape in the holographic person of Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross (Lt. Gen., USA Ret.).)\
\
Secretary Ross: Still no word from Vision?\
\
James Rhodes: Satellites lost him somewhere over Edinburgh.\
\
Secretary Ross: On a stolen Quinjet with four of the world's most wanted criminals.\
\
James Rhodes: You know they're only criminals because you've chosen to call them that, right, sir?\
\
Secretary Ross: My God, Rhodes, your talent for horseshit rivals my own.\
\
James Rhodes: If it weren't for those Accords, Vision would've been right here.\
\
Secretary Ross: I remember your signature on those papers, Colonel.\
\
James Rhodes: [Sounding a little bitter] That's right. And I'm pretty sure I've paid for that. [We get a good look at his leg braces]\
\
Secretary Ross: You have second thoughts?\
\
James Rhodes: Not anymore.\
\
[The fugitive Avengers enter the room, Vision supported by Sam.]\
\
Steve Rogers: Mr. Secretary.\
\
Secretary Ross: You got some nerve. I'll give you that.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: You could use some of that right now.\
\
Secretary Ross: The world's on fire. And you think, all is forgiven?\
\
Steve Rogers: I'm not looking for forgiveness. And I'm way past asking for permission. Earth just lost her best defender. So we're here to fight. [Steve takes a step forward, looking right at Ross] And if you wanna stand in our way... we'll fight you, too.\
\
Secretary Ross: [To Rhodes] Arrest them.\
\
James Rhodes: All over it. [Swipes off hologram; the computer beeps twice] That's a court-martial. It's great to see you, Cap.\
\
Steve Rogers: [Hugging Rhodes] You too, Rhodey. [Natasha gets her own embrace.]\
\
James Rhodes: Well. You guys really look like crap. Must've been a rough couple of years.\
\
Sam Wilson: Yeah, well, the hotels weren't exactly five star.\
\
Bruce Banner: Uh, I think you look great. [Rhodes and Natasha long round to see Bruce walking in from the opposite end of the room.] Uh... heh... Yeah. I'm back.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Hi, Bruce.\
\
Bruce Banner: Nat.\
\
Sam Wilson: [Whispering] This is awkward.\
\
[Cut to a shot of Natasha, Bruce, Steve, Rhodey, Wanda, and Vision in another room.]\
\
James Rhodes: So we gotta assume they're coming back, right?\
\
Wanda Maximoff: And they can clearly find us.\
\
Bruce Banner: We need all hands on deck. Where's Clint?\
\
Natasha Romanoff: After the whole Accords situation, he and Scott took a deal. It was too tough on their families, they're on house arrest.\
\
Bruce Banner: Who's Scott?\
\
Steve Rogers: Ant-Man.\
\
Bruce Banner: There's an Ant-Man and a Spider-Man? Okay, look\'85 Thanos has the biggest army in the universe. And he is not gonna stop until he... he gets... Vision's Stone.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Well then, we have to protect it.\
\
Vision: No, we have to destroy it. I've been giving a good deal of thought to this entity in my head, about its nature. But also, its composition. I think if it were exposed to a sufficiently powerful energy source, something, very similar to its own signature, perhaps\'85 its molecular integrity could fail. [Vision addresses Wanda as he nears her.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: And you, with it. We're not having this conversation.\
\
Vision: Eliminating the stone is the only way to be certain that Thanos can't get it.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: That's too high a price.\
\
Vision: [Takes her face gently in both hands] Only you have the power to pay it. [Wanda walks away, distressed] Thanos threatens half the Universe. One life cannot stand in the way of defeating him.\
\
Steve Rogers: [Eyes diverted down] But it should. [Looks up at Vision] We don't trade lives, Vision.\
\
Vision: [Walking toward Steve] Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down your life to save how many millions of people. Tell me, why is this any different?\
\
[Steve takes a breath, but before he has a chance to answer, Bruce speaks.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Because you might have a choice. Your mind is made up of a complex construct of overlays. J.A.R.V.I.S., Ultron, Tony, me, the Stone. All of them mixed together. All of them learning from one another.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying Vision isn't just the stone?\
\
Bruce Banner: I'm saying that if we take out the stone, there's still a whole lot of Vision left. Perhaps the best parts.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Can we do that?\
\
Bruce Banner: Not me. Not here.\
\
James Rhodes: You better find someone, and somewhere fast. Ross isn't exactly just gonna let you guys have your old rooms back.\
\
Steve Rogers: I know somewhere.\
\
[Cut to rural Wakanda, as King T'Challa and Okoye walk together, accompanied by two Kingsguard. Screen title: WAKANDA.]\
\
Okoye: You'll have the Kingsguard, and the Dora Milaje have been alerted.\
\
T'Challa: And the Border Tribe?\
\
Okoye: Those that are left.\
\
T'Challa: Send word to the Jabari as well. M'Baku likes a good fight.\
\
Okoye: And what of this one?\
\
T'Challa: This one may be tired of war. [James "Bucky" Buchanan Barnes is seen at a small distance throwing a bag from a pile on the ground onto a partly-filled cart, while two village children watch] But the White Wolf has rested long enough.\
\
[The party reaches Bucky. A Kingsguards-man sets an elaborate and high-tech-looking equipment case down on the cart, opens the lid, and steps back. As the Winter Soldier approaches, he sees a new Vibranium arm in the case.]\
\
Bucky Barnes: [With resignation] Where's the fight?\
\
T'Challa: On its way.\
\
[Cut to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange. Dr. Strange is floating horizontally, face down, and is surrounded by dozens of glassy needles, each about two feet long.]\
\
Ebony Maw: In all the time I've served Thanos, I've never failed him. If I were to reach our rendezvous on Titan with the Time Stone still attached to your vaguely irritating person, there would be... judgement. [The needles start to contact Dr. Strange's face, causing an obviously painful whitish subcutaneous glow at each touch] Give me... the stone.\
\
[Cut to Tony who is watching, hidden, from above. The Cloak of Levitation taps Stark on the arm. He raises his hand to it, ready to shoot, but he sees what it is and stands down.]\
\
Tony Stark: Wow you're a seriously loyal piece of outerwear, aren't you?\
\
Peter Parker: Yeah, uh, speaking of loyalty....\
\
[Tony and the Cloak turn to face Peter, dropping down from above]\
\
Tony Stark: What the--\
\
Peter Parker: I know what you're gonna say.\
\
Tony Stark: You should not be here.\
\
[The Cloak moves to "stand" at Tony's side]\
\
Peter Parker: I was gonna go home--\
\
Tony Stark: I don't wanna hear it.\
\
Peter Parker: But it was such a long way down and I just thought about you on the way...\
\
Tony Stark: And now I gotta hear it.\
\
[The Cloak shakes its collar in sympathy and shrugs]\
\
Peter Parker: ...And I kinda stuck to the side of the ship. And this suit is ridiculously intuitive, by the way. So if anything, it's kinda your fault that I'm here.\
\
[The Cloak looks shocked.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Seriously] What did you just say?\
\
Peter Parker: I take that back. And now I'm here in space.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. [Tony crosses to stand right in front of Peter] Right where I don't want you to be. This isn't Coney Island. This isn't a field trip. It's a one-way ticket. You hear me? Don't pretend like you thought this through. You could not have possibly thought this through.\
\
Peter Parker: No. I did think this through.\
\
Tony Stark: You could not have possibly thought this through.\
\
Peter Parker: It's just .. you can't be a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood. [He waits for Tony's reaction] Okay. That didn't really make any sense, but you know what I'm trying to say.\
\
Tony Stark: [Breaths shakily] Come on. We got a situation. [He leads Peter over to a viewpoint on the torture below. Peter crouches to study the situation, the Cloak leaning over his shoulder.] See him down there? He's in trouble. What's your plan? Go.\
\
Peter Parker: Um. Okay, okay... uh... [Peter and the Cloak pop back upright] Okay. Did you ever see this really old movie, Aliens?\
\
[The Cloak lifts its collar in surprise.]\
\
[Cut back to Ebony Maw interrogating Dr. Strange, who groans loudly.]\
\
Ebony Maw: Painful aren't they? They were originally designed for microsurgery. And any one of them...\
\
[At the "thump" behind him, Maw turns to see Iron Man standing there, hand repulsors ready to fire.]\
\
Ebony Maw: ...Could end your friend's life in an instant.\
\
Tony Stark: I gotta tell you, he's not really my friend. Saving his life is more a professional courtesy.\
\
Ebony Maw: [Walks slowly towards Iron Man, beckoning very large, very solid metal objects to float behind him] You've saved nothing. Your powers are inconsequential compared to mine.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, but the kid's seen more movies.\
\
[Iron Man fires a rocket from his shoulder which pierces the side of the ship to Maw's right and begins to suck everything out with depressurization, especially Maw and his large objects. Dr. Strange is pulled loose of his pinnings, loses the needles, but also heads for the hole, helpless to resist. The Cape wraps around his arm and an anchor point, but Dr. Strange's arm slips loose and he keeps going. Spider-Man shoots a web strand at Dr. Strange with one hand and holds onto a piece of the ship with the other. It breaks, sending them both towards space when his Iron-Spider suit's metal arms brace him to keep him from being sucked out. Fortunately, Dr. Strange is still surrounded by the ship's atmosphere making haste to leave.]\
\
Peter Parker: Yes! Wait what are those?!\
\
[Spider-Man crouches with his new spider-legs, and makes a mighty leap to pulls them both back inside. Iron Man quickly sprays nanites onto the hole to plug it up. Dr. Strange safely, if emphatically, hits the floor. Ebony Maw is seen floating in space, quite dead, ice from the escaped atmosphere frosting over his grimace. Spider-Man lands on his new legs, retracts them, and finds the Cape "standing" next to him.]\
\
Peter Parker: Hey, we haven't officially met. [He offers the Cape his hand to shake. It ignores his offer and continues to Dr. Strange.] Cool.\
\
[Iron Man walks past Dr. Strange, shaking his head and with his armor retreating into its containment as Dr. Strange gets to his feet and becomes en-Cloaked.]\
\
Stephen Strange: We've gotta turn this ship around.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah. Now he wants to run. Great plan.\
\
Stephen Strange: No, I want to protect the stone.\
\
[Tony walks towards the expansive front view-port, showing a hyper speed/warp effect.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Irritably] And I want you to thank me now. Go ahead, I'm listening.\
\
Stephen Strange: For what? Nearly blasting me into space?\
\
Tony Stark: Who just saved your magical ass? Me.\
\
Stephen Strange: I seriously don't know how you fit your head into that helmet.\
\
Tony Stark: Admit it. You should have ducked out when I told you to. I tried to bench you. You refused.\
\
Stephen Strange: Unlike everyone else in your life, I don't work for you.\
\
Tony Stark: And due to that fact, we're now in a flying doughnut billions of miles away from Earth with no backup.\
\
[Seriously, these two's egos are a recipe for disaster.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Raises his hand] I'm backup.\
\
Tony Stark: No. You're a stowaway. [Waggles a finger between himself and Dr. Strange] The adults are talking.\
\
Stephen Strange: I'm sorry, I'm confused as to the relationship here. Wh-- what is he, your ward?\
\
Peter Parker: No. I'm Peter, by the way.\
\
Stephen Strange: Dr. Strange.\
\
Peter Parker: Oh, we're using our made-up names. Um... I'm Spider-Man, then.\
\
Tony Stark: This ship is self-correcting its course. Thing's on autopilot.\
\
Stephen Strange: [Walks closer to Tony] Can we control it? Fly us home? [Tony is lost in bad memories and does not respond right away.] Stark?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah?\
\
Stephen Strange: Can you get us home?\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah I heard you. I'm thinking... I'm not so sure we should.\
\
Stephen Strange: Under no circumstance can we bring the Time Stone to Thanos. I don't think you quite understand what's at stake here.\
\
Tony Stark: [Stalks over to Strange] No. It's you who doesn't understand, that Thanos has been inside my head for six years since he sent an army to New York and now he's back! And I don't know what to do. So I'm not so sure if it's a better plan to fight him on our turf or his but you saw what they did, what they can do. At least on his turf, he's not expecting it. So I say we take the fight to him. Doctor. Do you concur?\
\
Stephen Strange: [Pauses] Alright, Stark. We go to him. But you have to understand... if it comes to saving you or the kid or the Time Stone... I will not hesitate to let either of you die. I can't, because the fate of the universe depends on it.\
\
Tony Stark: Nice. Good. Moral compass. We're straight. [Stepping over to Peter, he formally taps each of Peter's shoulders with the edge of his hand, dubbing him as is done at a knighting.] Alright, kid. You're an Avenger now. [He doesn't look at him as he says those words, knowing well what he is signing him up for.]\
\
[Peter looks at Tony in disbelief, and then cycles through delight, satisfaction, pride and determination, and braces himself for what's to come.]\
\
[Cut to Thanos' mother-ship, Sanctuary II, which dwarfs the massive ring-ships the Black Order have been using. Gamora sits near the throne deep inside the ship. Thanos walks up, bringing a cup of food and holds it out to her.]\
\
Thanos: I thought you might be hungry.\
\
[Gamora takes it, then hurls it across the room where it bangs against Thanos' throne with a loud clack.]\
\
Gamora: I always hated that chair.\
\
Thanos: So I've been told. Even so. I'd hoped you'd sit on it one day.\
\
Gamora: I hated this room. This ship. I hated my life.\
\
Thanos: You told me that too. [Thanos mounts two of the four steps to his throne, turns, and sits on the second from the top.] Every day. For almost twenty years.\
\
Gamora: I was a child when you took me.\
\
Thanos: I saved you.\
\
Gamora: No. No. We were happy on my home planet.\
\
Thanos: Going to bed hungry, scrounging for scraps. Your planet was on the brink of collapse. I'm the one who stopped that. Do you know what's happened since then? The children born have known nothing but full bellies and clear skies. It's a paradise.\
\
Gamora: Because you murdered half the planet.\
\
Thanos: A small price to pay for salvation.\
\
Gamora: You're insane.\
\
Thanos: Little one, it's a simple calculus. This universe is finite, its resources finite. If life is left unchecked, life will cease to exist. It needs correction.\
\
Gamora: You don't know that!\
\
Thanos: [Scowls as his egotistical narcissism prevents him from fully listening to her] I'm the only one who knows that. At least, I'm the only one with the will to act on it. [He stands again and walks back to Gamora] For a time... you had that same will... as you fought by my side. Daughter.\
\
Gamora: I'm not your daughter. Everything I hate about myself you taught me.\
\
Thanos: And in doing so, made you the fiercest woman in the galaxy. That's why I trusted you to find the Soul Stone.\
\
Gamora: I'm sorry I disappointed you.\
\
Thanos: I am disappointed. But not because you didn't find it. [Leans down to put their heads at a level, whispering fiercely] But because you did. [Looks at her] And you lied.\
\
[Thanos and Gamora stand outside a large solid door that slides open vertically as they approach, then pause as a set of inner doors made of interlacing metal slide away. Inside, we see Nebula face-on, suspended horizontally in the air in the middle of the room, her breath shuddering in pain.]\
\
Gamora: Nebula.\
\
[Gamora hurries to to Nebula's left side, and we now see that she has been partially disassembled, her components stretched apart -- a cybernetic version of the medieval torture rack. Hannibal Lecter level of brutality.]\
\
Gamora: Don't do this.\
\
Thanos: Some time ago, your sister snuck aboard this ship to kill me.\
\
Gamora: Please don't do this.\
\
Thanos: And very nearly succeeded. So I brought her here. To talk.\
\
[Thanos curls his gauntleted fist, activating both the Power and Space Stones, scowling -- causing Nebula's already extended pieces to stretch further outward. She begins to scream.]\
\
Gamora: Stop. Stop it. [She puts her hands on the gauntlet, pulling it down] I swear to you on my life. I never found the Soul Stone.\
\
[Thanos signals a nearby servant who taps on a control pad. We hear Nebula's voice say, "Accessing memory files" and a sort of hologram of Gamora's face shudders to life.]\
\
Memory Nebula: You know what he's about to do. He's finally ready, and he's going for the stones. All of them.\
\
Memory Gamora: He can never get them all.\
\
Memory Nebula: He will!\
\
Memory Gamora: He can't, Nebula. Because I found the map to the Soul Stone and I burnt it to ash. I burnt it.\
\
[The memory ends.]\
\
Thanos: [To Gamora, walking around behind her] You're strong. Me. You're generous. Me. But I never taught you to lie. That's why you're so bad at it. [His voice drips with disgust] Where is the Soul Stone? [He raises his gauntlet next to Gamora's face. Nebula shakes her head, expression terrified, to encourage her sister's silence but when Gamora does not answer, Thanos clenches the gauntlet again, brow furrowed at his adopted daughter as the Power and Space Stones are reactivated. Gamora grimaces in shared pain at her sister's screams, growing louder as Thanos increases the pressure.]\
\
Gamora: Vormir! [Thanos unclenches his hand, and Nebula gasps in air as her parts snap back almost into place. Gamora goes to her and caresses her face.] The Stone is on Vormir.\
\
Thanos: [Satisfied.] Show me.\
\
[Cut to the pod taking Thor, Rocket and Groot to Nidavellir.]\
\
Groot: [Irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: I need to tinkle.)\
\
Rocket: Tinkle in the cup. We're not looking. What's there to see? What's a twig? Everybody's seen a twig.\
\
Groot: [Still irritably] I am Groot. (Translation: But the cup is full.)\
\
Thor: [While looking out the rear portholes] Tree, pour what's in the cup out in space, and go in the cup again.\
\
Rocket: You speak Groot?\
\
Thor: Yes, they taught it on Asgard. It was an elective.\
\
Groot: [Shortly] I am Groot. (Translation: How long 'till we get there?)\
\
Thor: You'll know when we're there. Nivadellir's forge harnesses the power of a blazing neutron star. [Nostalgically] It's the birth place of my hammer. It's truly awesome.\
\
[Rocket turns to see Thor sitting sadly beside the window, and sighs.]\
\
Rocket: [To himself] Okay, time to be the captain. [Walks to a console near by Thor, presses two buttons] So, dead brother, huh? Yeah, that can be annoying.\
\
Thor: Well, he's been dead before, but this time I think it really might be true.\
\
Rocket: And you said your sister and your dad?\
\
Thor: Both dead.\
\
Rocket: Still got a mom, though?\
\
Thor: Killed by a dark elf.\
\
Rocket: A best friend?\
\
Thor: Stabbed through the heart.\
\
Rocket: Are you sure you're up to this particular murder mission?\
\
Thor: [Smiling widely but also trying to convince himself] Absolutely. Rage, vengeance, anger, loss, regret... they're all tremendous motivators. They really clear the mind. So I'm good to go.\
\
Rocket: Yeah, but this Thanos we're talking about... he's the toughest there is.\
\
Thor: Well, he's never fought me.\
\
Rocket: Yeah, he has!\
\
Thor: He's never fought me twice. And I'm getting a new hammer, don't forget.\
\
Rocket: Better be some hammer.\
\
Thor: You know, I'm 1,500 years old. I've killed twice as many enemies as that, and every one would have rather killed me, but none succeeded. I'm only alive because fate wants me alive. Thanos is the latest in a long line of bastards and he will be the latest to feel my vengeance. Fate wills it so.\
\
Rocket: And what if you're wrong?\
\
Thor: If I'm wrong then... what more could I lose?\
\
[Thor sniffs and hastily wipes below his eye. He stands and seats himself at the front of the pod, beside Groot.]\
\
Rocket: [Under his breath] I could lose a lot. Me personally. I could lose a lot. [Rocket takes an eyeball from somewhere on his person] Okay. If fate does want you to kill that crapsack... you're gonna need more than one stupid eyeball. [He gives Thor the eyeball.]\
\
Thor: What's this?\
\
Rocket: What's it look like? Some jerk lost a bet with me on on Contraxia.\
\
Thor: He gave you his eye?\
\
Rocket: He gave me 100 credits. I snuck in later that night and stole his eye.\
\
Thor: Thank you, sweet rabbit.\
\
[Thor proceeds to put the eyeball in his socket. We are thankfully spared the explicit insertion.]\
\
Rocket: Hmm. Huh? Oh. I would've washed that. The only way I could sneak it off Contraxia was up my...[beeping] Hey, we're here!\
\
Thor: [Smacking his palm against the side of his head to get the eye calibrated] I don't think this thing works. Everything seems dark.\
\
Rocket: It ain't the eye.\
\
[Nidavellir is dark and motionless as the three rings around it.]\
\
Thor: Something's wrong. The star's gone out. And the rings are frozen.\
\
[The pod flies through massive machinery, cold and inert. Screen title: NIDAVELLIR]\
\
[The pod sets down; Thor, Rocket and Groot disembark and start walking through a seemingly abandoned and cluttered space. Groot is still playing his game.]\
\
Rocket: I hope these dwarves are better at forging than they are cleaning. Maybe they realized they live in a junk pile in the middle of space.\
\
Thor: This forge hasn't gone dark in centuries....\
\
Rocket: [Pauses, looking at a pedestal] You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?\
\
Thor: Yes. Why?\
\
Rocket: Look anything like that? [In fact, it looks exactly like that]\
\
Groot: [Uneasily] I am Groot.\
\
Thor: [Urgently] Go back to the pod.\
\
[Suddenly a massive figure storms towards them, flinging Thor away with one swing of his arm, and kicking Rocket and Groot against a wall of equipment.]\
\
Thor: Eitri, wait! Stop!\
\
Eitri: Thor?\
\
[Eitri is played by the legendary Peter Dinklage -- his giant size literally juxtaposing his name of dwarf.]\
\
Thor: What happened here?\
\
Eitri: You were supposed to protect us. Asgard was supposed to protect us!\
\
Thor: Asgard is destroyed. [Thor scrambles to his feet and points. Eitri stop his attack on Thor. He now believes Thanos had destroyed Asgard and leaving him in a similar survivor role like Eitri himself.] Eitri, the glove. What did you do?\
\
Eitri: [He walks brokenly across the space to sit heavily, leaning against an ore skip. Rocket and Groot get to their feet, the sapling checking his game.] 300 dwarves lived on this ring. I thought if I did what he asked, they'd be safe. I made what he wanted. A device capable of harnessing the power of the stones. Then he killed everyone anyway. All except me. 'Your life is yours,' he said. 'But your hands are mine alone.' [He holds up his immobile metal fists, encased in hardened molten metal.]\
\
Thor: Eitri, this isn't about your hands. Every weapon you've ever designed: every ax, hammer, sword - it's all inside your head. Now I know it feels like all hope is lost. Trust me, I know. But together, you and I, we can kill Thanos.\
\
[Cut to Nebula suspended in the interrogation room seen earlier, while a technician puts her back together. Nebula ejects her eyepiece and snaps the neck of the tech when he comes close enough to replace it. She walks to a console, straightening her left arm, dragging her still-dislocated right foot behind her, and inputs a code.]\
\
Nebula: Mantis, listen very carefully. I need you to meet me on Titan.\
\
[Cut to Peter Parker, Tony Stark, and Dr. Strange aboard the ship approaching the surface of Titan.]\
\
Peter Parker: [To Tony] Hey, what's going on?\
\
Stephen Strange: I think we're here.\
\
Tony Stark: I don't think this rig has a self-park function. [Urgently] Get your hand into this steering gimbal. Close those around it. You understand?\
\
Peter Parker: Yep, got it.\
\
Tony Stark: This was meant for one big guy, so we gotta to move at the same time.\
\
Peter Parker: Okay. Okay. Ready.\
\
[The ringship is heading straight for the center of what looks like one of a colossal game of jacks.]\
\
Peter Parker: We might wanna turn. Turn! Turn! Turn!!\
\
[Iron Man armors up as the ringship clips the "jack" obliquely, but still losing a good third of its hull in the collision. Spider-Man throws up his helmet at the same time. Doctor Strange steps between them and creates the Shield of the Seraphim around them all, anticipating a rough landing.]\
\
[The ship, now reduced to about 45%, plows through the dirt and stops, leaning slightly to one side. Screen title: TITAN.]\
\
[Doctor Strange helps Tony, now de-helmeted, to his feet; they're both panting a little from the exertion of arrival.]\
\
Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange] You alright? [Panting] That was close. I owe you one.\
\
[Spider-Man descends from above in classically spider-like fashion.]\
\
Peter Parker: Let me just say, if aliens wind up implanting eggs in my chest or something, and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.\
\
Tony Stark: [While pointing at Peter] I don't wanna hear another single pop culture out of you for the rest of the trip. You understand?\
\
Peter Parker: I'm trying to say that... something is coming.\
\
[A grenade rolls into view, and Peter, Strange and Tony get thrown well back when it fires its energy pulse. Star-Lord, Drax, and Mantis appear in the doorway]\
\
Drax: [Yelling] THANOS!!!! [He flings a blade at Doctor Strange, who neatly deflects it with a mystical shield, and in return sends the Cloak of Levitation at Drax's face, half-smothering him and throwing him to the floor. Star-Lord and Iron Man have a brief dogfight until a magnetic disc pins Iron Man face-first to a structure.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Crawling backwards frantically from an anxious-looking Mantis] AH! Whoawhoawhoawhoa! PLEASE DON'T PUT YOUR EGGS IN ME!\
\
[Spider-Man shoots web at Mantis in a panic, pinning arms to her body just before Star-Lord flies at him feet-first, kicking him away.]\
\
Peter Quill: Stay down, clown!\
\
[Star-Lord can't quite counter spider reflexes at first; he fires at Spider-Man, who extends his spider legs and leaps away, but an electric-like cord wraps around Spider-Man and his six new legs when he tries to attack, sending him rolling across the deck.]\
\
Drax: [Struggling with the Cloak of Levitation] Die, blanket of death!\
\
[Iron Man pulls free of the magnet; the Cloak pulls free of Drax as soon as Iron Man has a bead on his opponent and a foot on his torso.]\
\
[Star-Lord has Spider-Man in a head-lock, gun pointed at the smaller man's head.]\
\
[Doctor Strange has a mystical shield of golden energy up, and stands ready at the third point of the triangle. Mantis has struggled to her feet behind Star-Lord, still covered with webbing.]\
\
Peter Quill: Alright, everybody, stay where you are... chill the F out. [Star-Lord powers off his helmet] I'm gonna ask you this one time. Where's Gamora?\
\
Tony Stark: [De-helmeting] Yeah, I'll do you one better. Who's Gamora?\
\
Drax: I'll do you one better. Why is Gamora?\
\
Peter Quill: Tell me where the girl is, or I swear to you, I'm gonna French-fry this little freak.\
\
Tony Stark: Let's do it! You shoot my guy, I blast him. Let's go! [Tony extends his nano-tech cannon, looking uncannily like an electric shark about to eat Drax's face.]\
\
Drax: Do it, Quill! I can take it.\
\
Mantis: No, he can't take it!\
\
Stephen Strange: [Completely deadpan] She's right. You can't.\
\
Peter Quill: Oh yeah? You don't wanna tell me where she is? That's fine. I'll kill all three of you and beat it out of Thanos myself. [To Spider-Man] Starting with you.\
\
Stephen Strange: Wait, what. Thanos? [Trying to inject clarity and sanity into the situation] Alright, let me ask you this one time: What master do you serve?\
\
Peter Quill: What master do I serve? What am I supposed to say? "Jesus"?\
\
Tony Stark: [Getting it] You're from Earth?\
\
Peter Quill: I'm not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, that's on Earth, dip-shit. What are you hassling us for?\
\
Peter Parker: [Sounding slightly crushed] So, you're not with Thanos?\
\
Peter Quill: [Indignantly] With Thanos?! No, I'm here to kill Thanos! He took my girl- Wai- who are you?\
\
Peter Parker: [De-helmets] We're the Avengers, man.\
\
Peter Quill: Oh.\
\
Mantis: You're the ones Thor told us about!\
\
Tony Stark: You know Thor!?\
\
Peter Quill: Yeah. Tall guy, not that good-looking, [Peter gives him an incredulous look] needed saving.\
\
Doctor Strange: [Pause] Where is he now?\
\
[Cut to Nivadellir where Eitri is showing Thor, Rocket, and Groot the mold for Stormbreaker.]\
\
Rocket: This is the plan? We're gonna hit him with a brick?\
\
Eitri: It's a mold. A king's weapon. Meant to be the greatest in Asgard. In theory, it could even summon the Bifrost.\
\
Thor: Did it have a name?\
\
Eitri: Stormbreaker.\
\
Rocket: That's a bit much.\
\
Thor: So how do we make it?\
\
Eitri: You'll have to restart the forge. Awaken the heart of a dying star.\
\
Thor: Rabbit, fire up the pod.\
\
[Cut to Titan where the remaining Avengers and the Guardians are starting to work together. Quill is measuring the planet's tilt.]\
\
Peter Quill: The heck happened to this planet? It's eight degrees off its axis. Gravitational pull is all over the place.\
\
[in the background, Mantis is jumping joyfully in a low gravity spot.]\
\
Tony Stark: Yeah, we got one advantage. He's coming to us. We'll use it. All right, I have a plan. Or at least the beginnings of one. It's pretty simple. We draw him in, pin him down, get what we need. Definitely don't wanna dance with this guy. We just want the gauntlet.\
\
[Drax yawns.]\
\
Tony Stark: Are you yawning? In the middle of this, while I'm breaking it down? Huh? Did you hear what I said?\
\
Drax: I stopped listening after you said, "We need a plan."\
\
Tony Stark: [To Quill] Okay, Mr. Clean is on his own page.\
\
Peter Quill: See, "not winging it" isn't really what they do.\
\
Peter Parker: Uh, what exactly is it that they do?\
\
Mantis: [As fiercely as an 8-week-old kitten] Kick names, take ass.\
\
Drax: Yeah, that's right. [Agrees quietly as he settles into a stance facing the remaining Avengers.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Tony pauses with an expression of deep hopelessness] Alright, just get over here, please. Mr. Lord, can you get your folks to circle up?\
\
Peter Quill: "Mr. Lord." Star-Lord is fine. [Motions to Drax and Mantis,]\
\
Tony Stark: We gotta coalesce. 'Cause if all we come at him with is a plucky attitude....\
\
Peter Quill: Dude, don't call us plucky. We don't know what it means. Alright, we're optimistic, yes. I like your plan. Except it sucks, so let me do the plan, and that way it might be really good. [Peter Parker follows the conversation back and forth like a squash rally.]\
\
Drax: Tell him about the dance-off to save the universe.\
\
Tony Stark: What dance-off?\
\
Peter Quill: It's not a... it's not... it's nothing.\
\
Peter Parker: Like in Footloose, the movie?\
\
Peter Quill: [Excitedly] Exactly like Footloose. Is it still the greatest movie in history?\
\
Peter Parker: It never was.\
\
[Quill frowns sadly at him.]\
\
Tony Stark: Don't encourage this, alright?\
\
Peter Parker: Okay.\
\
Tony Stark: We're getting no help from Flash Gordon here.\
\
Peter Quill: Flash Gordon? By the way, that's a compliment. Don't forget, I'm half human. [Quill points at Stark and Parker] So that 50% of me that's stupid? That's 100% you.\
\
Tony Stark: Your math is blowing my mind.\
\
Mantis: Excuse me, but... does your friend often do that?\
\
[Dr. Strange is sitting cross-legged, floating slightly above the ground, his hands poised in a mystic gesture with the Time Stone glowing brightly in the Eye of Agamotto setting. Green vapor-like energy flows from the stone, and more intricate magical energy patterns circle Dr. Strange's forearms. The Cloak of Levitation flows behind him as if the Stone is creating a strong breeze. His eyes are closed, and his head is jerking rapidly from side to side, the motion blurring, but resembling looking for something.]\
\
Tony Stark: Strange, we alright?\
\
[Dr. Strange snaps out of his trance and falls forward, letting out a cry.]\
\
Tony Stark: You're back. You're alright.\
\
Peter Parker: Hey, what was that?\
\
Stephen Strange: [Panting] I went forward in time to view alternate futures. To see all the possible outcomes of the coming conflict.\
\
Peter Quill: How many did you see?\
\
Stephen Strange:14,000,605.\
\
Tony Stark: How many did we win?\
\
[Dr. Strange stares intently at Tony for a moment.]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Pause] One.\
\
[Cut to Thanos and Gamora appearing on sand dunes alternating with shallow pools around the base of a mountain. The sun is in full eclipse, lending eerie lighting to the scene. Screen title: VORMIR]\
\
Thanos: The stone had better be up there... for your sister's sake.\
\
[The walk up the mountain seems to be long, but not difficult. Paths worn by centuries or more of feet lead up to the summit, where Thanos and Gamora encounter a floating hooded figure].\
\
Stonekeeper: Welcome, Thanos, son of A'lars. Gamora, daughter of Thanos.\
\
Thanos: You know us?\
\
Stonekeeper: It is my curse to know all who journey here.\
\
Thanos: Where's the Soul Stone?\
\
Stonekeeper: You should know... it extracts a terrible price.\
\
Thanos: I am prepared.\
\
Stonekeeper: We all think that at first. [The figure touches down and glides out of the shadows, revealing the face of who we know to be Johann "The Red Skull" Schmidt from Captain America: The First Avenger.] We are all wrong.\
\
[The Stonekeeper guides them to a temple-like structure at the summit.]\
\
Thanos: How is it you know this place so well?\
\
Red Skull: A lifetime ago, I, too, sought the stones. I even held one in my hand. But it cast me out, banished me here. Guiding others to a treasure I cannot possess.\
\
[They stop on a semicircular engraving overlooking a sheer drop. It descends in three shallow steps to a final half-circle cutout, the whole bisected by a deep cut that runs between the two spires behind them. Far, far below is a full circle with similar engraved decoration.]\
\
Red Skull: What you seek lies before you. As does what you fear.\
\
Thanos: What's this?\
\
Red Skull: The price. Soul hold a special place among the Infinity Stones. You might say it has a certain wisdom.\
\
Thanos: Tell me what it needs.\
\
Red Skull: To ensure that whoever possesses it... understands its power.... The stone demands a sacrifice.\
\
Thanos: Of what?\
\
Red Skull: In order to take the stone, you must lose that which you love. A soul, for a soul.\
\
[Gamora begins to laugh at the irony of the situation.]\
\
Gamora: All my life, I dreamed of a day... a moment when you would get what you deserved. And I was always so disappointed. But now... you kill and torture... and you call it mercy. The universe has judged you. You asked it for a prize, and it told you no. You failed. And do you wanna know why? Because you love nothing. No one.\
\
Thanos: [Turns to face Gamora with tears in his eyes.]\
\
Gamora: Really? Tears?\
\
Red Skull: They're not for him.\
\
[Gamora looks at the Red Skull, and as her bitter smile fades, realizes what is about to happen, as do we.... ]\
\
Gamora: No! This isn't love!\
\
Thanos: [Thoroughly convicted.] I ignored my destiny once. I cannot do that again. Even for you. [Gamora stares down unseeing for a moment, then up at the resolution on his face. She grabs the red-jeweled dagger from his belt with lightning reflexes, triggers the blades and stabs herself in the stomach... except it's only bubbles.] I'm sorry, little one. [He grabs Gamora by the arm and walks inexorably to the precipice.]\
\
Gamora: No!\
\
[She tries in vain to break from his grasp, much like she tried to pull free from the Child of Thanos so many years ago, but, pain showing clearly on his face, he throws her over the edge, and watches sorrowfully as she falls to her death. Light pulses overhead as the sacrifice is correctly accomplished.]\
\
[Thanos finds himself lying in one of the shallow pools back at the base of the mountain. He opens his hand and sees that he now has the orange Soul Stone.]\
\
[Cut to the Quinjet where Sam is piloting Rhodey, Steve, Natasha, Wanda, and Vision.]\
\
Steve Rogers: [Walking up to the pilot's seat] Drop to 2600, heading 0-3-0.\
\
Sam Wilson: I hope you're right about this, Cap. Or we're gonna land a lot faster than you want to.\
\
[The Quinjet passes through a camouflage force field into Wakanda's Golden City's valley and lands at the airfield outside the palace. King T'Challa and the Dora Milaje approach to greet the arrivals]\
\
Okoye: [Walking with King T'Challa and a band of the Kingsguard to the landing pad] When you said we were going to open Wakanda to the rest of the world... this is not what I imagined.\
\
T'Challa: And what did you imagine?\
\
Okoye: The Olympics. Maybe even a Starbucks.\
\
[The occupants of the Quinjet disembark, Steve and Natasha leading, followed by Bruce and Rhodey, with Vision and Wanda slowly taking up the rear.]\
\
Bruce Banner: [To Rhodey] Should we bow?\
\
James Rhodes: [Seriously] Yeah, he's a king.\
\
Steve Rogers: Seems like I'm always thanking you for something. [Shaking hands with King T'Challa.]\
\
[Bruce bows awkwardly to King T'Challa.]\
\
James Rhodes: [Mock shocked] What are you doing?\
\
T'Challa: Uh, we don't do that here. [He dissuades Bruce with a motion of his hand; Bruce shoots Rhodey a look, and is answered with a big grin] So how big of an assault can we expect?\
\
[The group begins to walk back into the administrative building.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Uh, sir, I think you can expect quite a big assault.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: How we looking?\
\
King T'Challa: You will have my Kingsguard, the Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje, and...\
\
Bucky Barnes: [Smiling as he walks toward Steve, passing some Kingsguard taking Vision and Wanda to another facility] A semi-stable, 100-year-old man.\
\
[The two friends share a hug.]\
\
Steve Rogers: How you been, Buck?\
\
Bucky Barnes: Uh, not bad, for the end of the world.\
\
[In Shuri's lab, Shuri scans the Stone with her kimoyo beads while Vision lies on the examination table. She flips her hand over and studies the hologram projected over her palm.]\
\
Shuri: Whoa. The structure is polymorphic.\
\
Bruce Banner: Right, we had to attach each neuron non-sequentially.\
\
Shuri: Why didn't you just reprogram the synapses to work collectively?\
\
[Vision looks at Bruce as if to ask the same thing.]\
\
Bruce Banner: [Uncertainly] Because, we didn't think of it.\
\
Shuri: [Reassuringly, with a smile] I'm sure you did your best.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Can you do it?\
\
Shuri: Yes, but there are more than two trillion neurons here. One misalignment could cause a cascade of circuit failures. [To King T'Challa] It will take time, brother.\
\
Steve Rogers: How long?\
\
Shuri: As long as you can give me.\
\
Okoye: [Her kimoyo beads chime an alarm; she flicks one bead into her palm, where it projects the globe with a pulsing location marker] Something's entered the atmosphere.\
\
[Outside, Sam and Bucky look up at the sky]\
\
Sam Wilson: [Over the Avengers' comm] Hey, Cap, we got a situation here.\
\
[The defense shield over the Golden City destroys one of the alien vessels when it slams into the field at full attack acceleration.]\
\
Bucky Barnes: God, I love this place.\
\
James Rhodes: [also outside, and now in full War Machine armor watching three more ships burn through the sky] Yeah, don't start celebrating yet, guys. We got more incoming outside the dome.\
\
[The shock waves and debris from the ship landings destroy acres of forest and boil up against the dome. The lab has an excellent view of the landing sites. Captain America and Black Panther look at each other in concern over the scope of what they'll be facing.]\
\
Vision: [Struggling to sit up and slide off the exam table] It's too late. We need to destroy the stone now.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: [Moving toward Vision] Vision, get your ass back on the table.\
\
T'Challa: We will hold them off. [He, Okoye and the guards head for the door.]\
\
Steve Rogers: [To Wanda] Wanda, as soon as the stone's out of his head... you blow it to hell.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: I will.\
\
T'Challa: Evacuate the city. Engage all defense procedures. [He stops, turns, and points at Steve] And get this man a shield.\
\
[Cut to Nivadellir where Rocket is in the pod, and Thor, without any environmental suit, jumps from the hull onto the ring surface with a cable in his hand attached to the pod.]\
\
Rocket: I don't think you get the scientifics here. These rings are gigantic. You wanna get them moving, you're gonna need something a lot bigger to yank 'em loose.\
\
Thor: Leave that to me.\
\
Rocket: Leave that to you? Buddy, you're in space. All you got is a rope and a--\
\
Thor: [Thor begins to swing the pod around him in a circle. Rocket screams. Thor builds up speed with three good loops then slacks his grip enough to send the pod shooting straight away from Nidavellir, trailing him behind it like a kite tail.] Fire the engines!\
\
Rocket: [Rocket shakes it off and puts the proverbial pedal to the metal.] Nnnyah!\
\
Thor: [As the pod skims over the surface of the next ring out, Thor reaches down and digs one hand into the surface, then both feet, finally getting a foothold against the forward motion of the pod. The ice-like accumulation around the ring axis crackles.] MORE... POWER... RABBIT!\
\
[Thor commits bicep porn while Rocket accelerates for all he's worth. Finally the rings spin free, realigning into effective configuration as the star bursts back into life.]\
\
Eitri: Well done, boy.\
\
[Thor, clutching the pod's forward windows, points to the star.]\
\
Thor: That's Nivadellir!\
\
[Rocket gazes amazed at the blazing core. An iris on the cladding around the star opens, firing pure stellar heat through the ring portals and into the forge... until the damaged mechanism fails, crumbles loose and slams shut. The iris closes and the beam of light trails off.]\
\
Eitri: Damn it.\
\
Rocket: "Damn it"? What's "damn it"?\
\
Eitri: The mechanism is crippled.\
\
Thor: What?\
\
Eitri: With the iris closed I can't heat the metal.\
\
Thor: How long will it take to heat?\
\
Eitri: A few minutes, maybe more. Why?\
\
Thor: [Standing up on the pod hull] I'm gonna hold it open.\
\
Eitri: That's suicide.\
\
Thor: So is facing Thanos without that ax. [He leaps from the pod to the star's iris.]\
\
[Cut to the Wakandan battlefield. Carriers hover over the ground with Wakandan soldiers and Natasha, Steve and Bucky on board; Rhodey and Sam keep pace overhead, and Bruce is in the Hulkbuster armor.]\
\
Natasha Romanoff: How we looking, Bruce?\
\
Bruce Banner: [Leaping jogging along, keeping up with the carriers, and utterly delighted] Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it. Wow! It's like being the Hulk without actually-- [he stumbles on a rock, and a carrier goes by, from which Okoye gives him a dubious look. He stands] I'm okay. I'm okay.\
\
James Rhodes: I got two heat signatures breaking through the tree line.\
\
[The heat signatures are Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian.]\
\
[The carrier pilots swerve into U-turns, causing their craft to tilt and allowing the practiced soldiers to slide over one side into a run, never coming to a complete halt. A Dora Milaje shouts a command nearby as the last Wakandans join ranks.]\
\
Jabari Warriors: MIE EFFA! (Win them!) YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! MIE EFFA! YA HU! [M'Baku, Lord of the Jabari, rallies his soldiers with a war chant. He stops as King T'Challa nears him.]\
\
T'Challa: [Clasps wrists with M'Baku] Thank you for standing with us.\
\
M'Baku: [Translated from Xhosa] Of course, brother.\
\
[The Black Panther, Captain America, and Black Widow walk to the edge of the barrier, where Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian stand. Proxima tests the strength of the barrier by drawing her sword across it consideringly.]\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Where's your other friend?\
\
Proxima Midnight: You will pay for his life with yours. Thanos will have that stone.\
\
Steve Rogers: That's not gonna happen.\
\
T'Challa: You are in Wakanda now. Thanos will have nothing but dust and blood.\
\
Proxima Midnight: We... have blood to spare. [She brandishes her sword with a snarl, and the ships behind her start raising their outer hulls to allow their "passengers" to disembark.]\
\
[The three heroes return to the massed forces.]\
\
Bucky Barnes: [A touch sardonically] Did they surrender?\
\
Steve Rogers: Not exactly.\
\
[The Black Panther leads the Wakandans in the war cry "Yibambe!" telling them to hold fast as the Outriders bound toward the barrier; Proxima drops her sword arm down in the signal to attack.]\
\
Bucky Barnes: [Flatly, astonished at the numbers of Outriders] What the hell.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: Looks like we pissed her off.\
\
Okoye: [Horrified, as the Outriders bombard the force-field, squeezing limbs and bodies partly through only to be bisected.] They're killing themselves.\
\
[As a few Outriders managed to squeeze through intact, the Border Tribe take a knee and raise their shields. The Kingsguard behind them level their sonic spears over their comrades' shoulders, and on Black Panther's command, fire at the approaching monsters. The Winter Soldier uses his M-249 machine gun, and Bruce fires the Hulkbuster's hand repulsors.]\
\
Sam Wilson: [Sending Redwings into the fight as he flies, swooping to fire at them with his Steyr pistols] You seen the teeth on those things?\
\
James Rhodes: Alright, back up, Sam. You're gonna get your wings singed. [He flies over the heaviest concentration of Outriders and drops a barrage of mines, all exploding fantastically.]\
\
[Everyone notices a pack of Outriders starting to run around the force-field to the right of the defenders' position.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Cap, if these things circle the perimeter and get in behind us... there's nothing between them and Vision.\
\
Steve Rogers: [Grimly] Them we better keep 'em in front of us.\
\
Okoye: [To the Black Panther] How do we do that?\
\
T'Challa: We open the barrier. [Putting his comm to his mouth] On my signal, open North-West Section Seventeen.\
\
Dome Control: [Nervous and unsure] Requesting confirmation, my King. You said open the barrier?\
\
T'Challa: On my signal.\
\
M'Baku: [To Okoye] This will be the end of Wakanda.\
\
Okoye: Then it will be the noblest ending in history.\
\
[Captain America readies one of his Vibranium hand guards. The Black Panther shouts a command in Xhosa; the Border Tribesmen disengage their shields and stand, as the Black Panther walks out in front of them, never taking his eyes off the enemy.]\
\
T'Challa: WAKANDA FOREVER!!!! [He crosses his arms in the Wakandan salute and closes his Black Panther helmet, charging for the barrier. The heroes and leaders are at the fore of the charge. Halfway to the barrier, the Black Panther shouts into his comm] Now!\
\
[The Outriders pour through, distracted from trying to find any other access. The Black Panther and Captain America pull ahead rapidly due to their enhancements, and literally leap into battle.]\
\
T'Challa: [Over his comm] How much longer, Shuri?\
\
Shuri: We've barely begun, brother. [A delicate and intricate construction of gold light hovers at her eye level; as she manipulates it, the waldo tools reproduce her commands on the Mind Stone itself.]\
\
T'Challa: You might want to pick up the pace.\
\
[Simultaneously, Thor prepares to open the iris of Nidavellir.]\
\
Thor: Allfathers, give me strength.\
\
Eitri: You understand, boy? You're about to take the full force of a star. It'll kill you.\
\
Thor: Only if I die. [Takes deep breaths.]\
\
Eitri: [Boggled] Yes. That's what... "killing you" means.\
\
[Thor grasps the two levers and pulls them down and towards himself, slowly opening the iris. The stream of stellar energy blasts pasts him and into the forge once again.]\
\
Eitri: Hold it! Hold it, Thor!\
\
[Eitri watches the metal ingots melt while Thor is looking increasingly charred. Finally, Eitri is able to tip the cauldron, pouring the metal into the mold just as Thor passes out. The jet carries him into the forge, Rocket follows hastily and landing after Thor bounces limply off a structure to land on the floor. Groot finally looks up from his game at the thump Thor's body makes.]\
\
Rocket: [Kneeling over Thor] Thor! Say something. Come on. Thor, you okay? [Thor looks far from "okay".]\
\
[Eitri clumsily and urgently pulls the mold, still glowing red-hot, onto the floor, breaking it loose from its frame, then starts punching the mold itself with his metal fists to free the ax.]\
\
Rocket: I think he's dying!\
\
Eitri: He needs the ax! Where's the handle? Tree, help me find the handle!\
\
[Stormbreaker's two sections -- the hammer and the ax-blade -- lay glowing on the floor. Groot looks sadly at Thor, then scowls with determination. He stands, and extends his fingers towards Stormbreaker, growing them at extraordinary speed. As he twines them around the two parts, he cries out at the burning pain but does not hesitate, slamming them together and locking them permanently into one structure. He raises it above his head, and with a mighty cry, chops his extended arm with his other hand to sever it at the right length.Thor's fingers twitch, and the new weapon levitates in a crackle of lightning echoed by the sparks between Thor's fingers.]\
\
[The remaining Avengers and Wakandans are struggling against the Outriders. The Winter Soldier goes down, and fights off Outrider fangs snapping at his head. Captain America and the Black Panther still fight side-by-side. War Machine hovers over the breach, pouring ammunition into the flood of bodies until a huge hammer -- Cull Obsidian's -- knocks him out of the sky and to the ground. The Hulkbuster is dogpiled and pinned.]\
\
Bruce Banner: There\'92s too many of them! GYAH! AAAAHHHHH!\
\
[Suddenly, a large beam of rainbow-hued light lands in the middle of the action, and an ax flies out of it, wreathed with lightning and tearing through the Outriders, freeing the heroes. It flies back to the light and into its master's hand just as the beam cuts out, revealing Thor, Groot and Rocket [The Avengers theme swelling triumphantly at their arrival] who chambers a round in his large gun. Black Widow, Captain America and the Black Panther pause in astonishment. Proxima Midnight and Cull Obsidian pause in apprehension.]\
\
Bruce Banner: [Opening the Hulkbuster's helm and laughing with joy] AH-hahaha! You guys are so screwed now!\
\
Thor: BRING ME THANOS! [He charges toward the hordes of Outriders, followed by Groot and Rocket, lightning gathering around him until he finally launches himself into the air, lands in the densest concentration of Outriders and makes a crater where they had stood.]\
\
[Cut to Titan, where Thanos arrives, finding only fresh debris from Ebony Maw's ship.]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Sitting on what may have been plaza steps once] Oh, yeah, you're much more of a "Thanos."\
\
Thanos: I take it the Maw is dead. This day extracts a heavy toll. Still, he accomplished his mission.\
\
Stephen Strange: You may regret that. He brought you face-to-face with the Master of the Mystic Arts.\
\
Thanos: And where do you think he brought you? [Star-Lord crouches behind wreckage with his weapon ready, behind Thanos and to his left; Spider-Man peeks from above and behind Doctor Strange.]\
\
Stephen Strange: Let me guess. Your home?\
\
Thanos: [Smiling reminiscently] It was. And it was beautiful. [Thanos curls his gauntleted fist and activates the Reality Stone to show Strange Titan before it was destroyed -- green lawns, intact buildings, water-filled ponds, strolling citizens, the jack-like structures hovering and connected to the ground-based buildings with beams of energy.] Titan was like most planets. Too many mouths, and not enough to go around. And when we faced extinction, I offered a solution.\
\
Stephen Strange: Genocide.\
\
Thanos: But at random, dispassionate, fair to rich and poor alike. They called me a madman. And what I predicted came to pass. [He relaxes his fist; the Stone stops glowing and the illusion fades back into the true state of Titan.]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Sarcastically] Congratulations. You're a prophet.\
\
Thanos: I'm a survivor.\
\
Stephen Strange: Who wants to murder trillions.\
\
Thanos: With all six stones, I could simply snap my fingers, and they would all cease to exist. I call that... mercy.\
\
Stephen Strange: [Stands] And then what?\
\
Thanos: I finally rest... and watch the sun rise on a grateful universe. The hardest choices require the strongest wills.\
\
Stephen Strange: [He summons his Mandalas, entering a fighting pose] I think... you'll find... our will... equal to yours.\
\
Thanos: Ours? [He looks up to a see a chunk of wreckage descending rapidly on him, too rapidly to react -- and powered by Iron Man. He is subsequently crushed by it.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Flying in] Piece of cake, Quill.\
\
Peter Quill: [Triggers his mask and follows] Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!\
\
[The wreckage on top of Thanos erupts in purple, as he bellows in rage. He turns the hovering fragments into a flock of bats with the Reality Stone and swarms Iron Man with them, driving him back through the ruins.]\
\
[Spider-Man webs his eyes, and swings in to kick him in the face at the same time that Drax leaps from cover, blades in both hands, to knee-slide behind Thanos and try for a tendon slide across the back of the Titan's knee.]\
\
[Doctor Strange jumps through a portal and summons a sword of golden energy, dueling with Thanos while Drax attacks similarly on his other side. Thanos punches Drax through a ruined wall, then shatters the blade with one hand and tears the web from his eyes. He advances on Doctor Strange and kicks at him, but Strange's shield absorbs the damage -- the Cloak lifts him free of the ground.]\
\
[Star-Lord has been making his way back on the ground, and shoots Thanos from behind. Thanos uses the Power Stone to shoot balls of energy at Star-Lord while Star-Lord leaps towards Thanos using magical platforms thrown in his path by Doctor Strange, the last one placed above Thanos' head so Star-Lord can flip over him and slap a mine on Thanos' back. Star-Lord sticks his landing, he disengages his helmet, flips Thanos a bird and falls backward into a portal.]\
\
Peter Quill: Boom!\
\
[The explosion knocks Thanos to his knees and dazes him briefly.]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Whispers to the Cloak of Levitation] Do not let him close his fist. [The Cloak swoops off Doctor Strange's shoulders and wraps itself tightly around Thanos' armored hand, who starts tugging at this unexpected wrapping.]\
\
[Doctor Strange starts throwing portals everywhere. Spider-Man leaps through one on Thanos' left]\
\
Peter Parker: Magic! [He punches Thanos in the head and vanishes through a portal to the lower right before reappearing above Thanos] More magic! [He yanks Thanos' head down hard, then leaps into a portal in front of him. He leaps through another portal high and behind Thanos] Magic with a kick! [Delivers a flying kick and falls feet-first into an exit, then appears on his right] Magic with a--\
\
[Before he can finish Thanos turns, grabbing him from the air, and throwing him to the ground, with his hand around his neck.]\
\
Thanos: Insect!\
\
[He then throws him at Doctor Strange, knocking them both down. Thanos finally tears the Cloak away and is then promptly surrounded by fiery explosions as Iron Man bombards him. He sucks all the flame into the gauntlet with the Power Stone and fires it in a stream at Iron Man, hitting him dead on and sending him far away, plowing through a massive fallen machine.]\
\
[Spider-Man leaps from behind, more conventionally this time, while Thanos concentrates his fire on Iron Man, webs the gauntlet and drops down in front of him, pulling hard -- but Thanos yanks on the web-line, pulling the much lighter teenager towards him, and punching him on his way past. He tears the webbing free of the gauntlet just in time for a small spaceship to attempt to crash-land on him.]\
\
[The ship drags Thanos along for a distance, burying him under debris. He stands just as the pilot leaps in a great arc to punch him, landing in front of him with an energy-blade at the ready.]\
\
Thanos: Well, well.\
\
Nebula: You should have killed me.\
\
Thanos: It would've been a waste of parts!\
\
Nebula: [She runs at Thanos, attacking him with her sword] Where's Gamora?!\
\
[Thanos punches her away. Doctor Strange uses the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to pinion the gauntlet, pulling Thanos' fingers open and trying to pry the gauntlet off his hand.]\
\
[Thanos tries to pull free, as Drax slides in from his right, kicking his knee and knocking him off-balance, then wrapping himself around Thanos' kneeling leg.]\
\
[Star-Lord shoots a electric trap onto the ground to Thanos' right, the tangle-field holding down his unarmored hand.]\
\
[Spider-Man swings in, webs Thanos' chest then wraps it around behind him, digging his Iron Spider legs into the ground to anchor himself.]\
\
[Doctor Strange opens a portal straight above Thanos' out of which drops Mantis, landing on the Titan's shoulders, her hands on his temples. He bellows as she tries to put him under.]\
\
[Iron Man, having returned, is pulling on the gauntlet. Doctor Strange reapplies the Crimson Bands of Cyttorak to reinforce the trap's hold on Thanos' right hand, and the Cloak helps him pull. Thanos is finally subdued enough to incapacitate, not fully asleep.]\
\
Tony Stark: [While pulling] Is he under? Don't let up.\
\
Mantis: [Starting to cry] Be quick. He is very strong.\
\
Tony Stark: Parker, help! Get over here. [Spider-Man drops his web-line, and hurries to help Tony with the gauntlet] She can't hold him much longer. Let's go.\
\
Peter Quill: [Flies over to join the others, stands in front of Thanos, tauntingly] I thought you'd be harder to catch. For the record, this was my plan. Not so strong now, huh? Where is Gamora?\
\
Thanos: My Gamora...?\
\
Peter Quill: No, bull-shit. Where is she?\
\
Mantis: [Shocked] He is in anguish.\
\
Peter Quill: Good.\
\
Mantis: [Crying] He\'85 he mourns.\
\
Drax: What does this monster have to mourn?\
\
Nebula: Gamora.\
\
Peter Quill: [Pause] What?\
\
Nebula: [Realizing with horror and sadness what has happened] He took her to Vormir. He came back with the Soul Stone... but she didn't.\
\
Tony Stark: [Frasps the danger immediately and de-helmets] Okay, Quill, you gotta cool it right now, you understand?\
\
[Quill slowly turns to Thanos,]\
\
Tony Stark: [Shouting his pleads desperately] Don't, don't, don't engage, we've almost got this off!\
\
Peter Quill: Tell me she's lying. [Enraged] Asshole! Tell me you didn't do it!\
\
Thanos: I... had... to.\
\
Peter Quill: [While starting to tear up; quietly] No, you didn't\'85! No, you didn't\'85! [He continues to rage and then pistol-whipping Thanos twice in the face, causing Mantis to let go in pain.] NO, YOU DIDN'T!\
\
Tony Stark: Quill!\
\
[Iron Man leaps for Star-Lord's arm, re-helmeting and leaving Spider-Man to pull off the gauntlet.]\
\
Tony Stark: [To the struggling Star-Lord] Hey, stop! Hey, stop! Stop! Hey, stop! Stop!\
\
Peter Parker: It's coming! It's coming! It's coming! [Getting the fingers completely loose] I got it! I got it.... !\
\
[Thanos wakes completely, now well and truly furious. He head-butts Mantis, grabbing the cuff of the gauntlet just as it is sliding off his hand, causing Spider-Man to stumble back, and then throwing Mantis away off his shoulders.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Seeing Mantis with far too much air under her] Oh, God. [He jumps and wraps his arms and legs around her, extending his spider legs to form a roll cage for a safe landing.]\
\
[Thanos kicks Drax off his right leg and into Nebula and Star-Lord, knocking them down. He yanks on the Crimson Bands holding his right hand to throw Doctor Strange far away, and swats away Iron Man and his repulsor shots. The remaining Guardians jump up and charge him again, but he fires a pulse of indigo energy at them that knocks the three of them completely unconscious.]\
\
[Iron Man zooms back in, his nanite arm cannon manifested, and is head-butted to the ground. Thanos looks at him for a beat, then raises the gauntlet towards Titan's moon. Iron Man stares, aghast. Thanos uses a combination of the Power and Space Stones to shatter the moon's surface, then bring the debris down on the field of battle at speed. Iron Man powers out of the way but is caught by a chunk of moon about the size of a baseball field, slamming him into the ground. The Guardians go sailing into the air from the rebound.]\
\
[Back in Wakanda, Shuri is working steadily to complete the Mind Stone's removal; Wanda stands by tensely]\
\
[The Kingsguard, Borderers and Jabari have little success going against Cull Obsidian's chained hammer -- he either sends them flying or punches them into the ground. The Black Panther gets free of his other sorties, leaps and uses all his collected kinetic energy behind a punch that lays Obsidian flat.]\
\
Rocket: [Having found a clear spot] Come and get some, space dogs! [Another wave of Outriders heads right for the raccoon-oid. The Winter Soldier, having come up behind Rocket, grabs him with his mechanical arm, holds him at arms length and spins 540 degrees, firing his own M-249 at the same time.] Come on, get some, get some! Come on, get some! [The Winter Soldier drops Rocket, who looks up at him with an impressed gleam] How much for the gun?\
\
Bucky Barnes: [Snaps off another burst] Not for sale.\
\
Rocket: Okay, how much for the arm? [The Winter Soldier just gives him a look and moves off] Oh, I'll get that arm.\
\
[The tides of battle cause Thor, using Stormbreaker to great effect, and Captain America together. They take a breather.]\
\
Steve Rogers: [Panting] New haircut?\
\
Thor: [Grinning] Notice you've copied my beard.\
\
[Captain America nods, wearily gesturing at his own face with a shield-covered hand. Groot skewers three Outriders with his right arm.]\
\
Thor: By the way, this is a friend of mine. Tree. [Gestures towards Groot with Stormbreaker]\
\
Groot: [In full battle snarl] I AM GROOT! (Translation: You gonna help me or what?!)\
\
Steve Rogers: [Formally, but bemused] I am Steve Rogers.\
\
[In Shuri's lab, a deep rumbling can be heard even at their height. Wanda looks down on the battlefield, and sees movement through the blazing forest between the troopships and the dome. When the disturbance reaches the edge of the trees, it turns into vast moving mounds of earth that easily bypass the force field and emerge -- Threshers, sets of massive, motorized spiked wheels, intended for nothing more than shredding everything in their paths.]\
\
T'Challa: Fall back! Fall back now!\
\
[Wanda watches as at least one set of Threshers separates into individual wheels and starts veering all over the battlefield, and then looks anxiously back at Vision]\
\
James Rhodes: Focus that fire on the left flank, Sam.\
\
Sam Wilson: I'm doing it. [The two fliers use their firepower to crack a Thresher but cannot find a weak spot.]\
\
[Black Widow with her escrima sticks and Okoye with her augmented spear have drifted together when they're suddenly in the path of a Thresher. Both women cringe at their seemingly inevitable shredding when the Scarlet Witch lands in front of both of them, eyes glowing red, lifting the whole Thresher well clear of the ground. Looking behind her, the friendly forces have scattered and replaced by a charging mob of Outriders -- the perfect place to throw a Thresher. Black Widow straightens with a pleased smile, Okoye with an amazed look.]\
\
Okoye: [A touch indignant] Why was she up there all this time?\
\
[The Children of Thanos help answer that question.]\
\
Proxima Midnight: She's on the field. Take it.\
\
[Corvus Glaive kills one of the guards just outside the lab, alerting Shuri to the problem. She starts hastily disconnecting her equipment from Vision's systems; he gasps at the sensations. The Dora Milaje engages Glaive but is sent skidding across the floor. Shuri finishes her shutdown, grabs one of her sonic panther-paws and fires at Glaive. The Dora attacks again, and Glaive sends both her and Shuri through the balcony railing and onto the main lab floor.]\
\
[Vision is not where Corvus Glaive expects to find him. Vision is, in fact, charging at him and knocking him out the window to fall many meters down the face of Mount Bashenga.]\
\
Sam Wilson: Guys, we got a Vision situation here. [He's tackled by a leaping Outrider and grounded.]\
\
Steve Rogers: Somebody get to Vision!\
\
Bruce Banner: I got him! [Bruce has figured out the Hulkbusters repulsor thrusters and makes a beeline for the android.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: On my way. [She is clobbered by Proxima Midnight's pommel and rolls down into the large ditch from the Thresher before she can move.]\
\
Proxima Midnight: [Jumping down next to the Scarlet Witch] He'll die alone. As will you.\
\
Natasha Romanoff: She's not alone.\
\
[Okoye silently brandishes her spear on the other side of Proxima and nods at Black Widow.]\
\
Proxima Midnight: Euuyaaah! [She leaps for Black Widow, who has joined her sticks into a full staff. She blocks Proxima's blow with an electrical crackle while Okoye runs around the slope to also attack from the front.]\
\
[Corvus Glaive kicks Vision, knocking him down; as he attempts to rise again, Cull Obsidian shows up and swings his hammer in a full arc, throwing Vision even further. He painfully starts to climb to his feet again when a whooshing overhead interrupts the fight as Bruce Banner lands the Hulkbuster between the aliens and the android. He takes a defensive stance, pointing one hand's repulsor at each.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Oh no, oh no you don't. This isn't going to be like New York, pal. This suit's already kicked the crap out of the Hulk-- [Cull Obsidian jumps forward, grabs Bruce's right arm and Bruce in reflex grabs Obsidian's hammer; a jet fires, taking the two of them in a random direction, to the base of a waterfall.]\
\
Bruce Banner: Guys! Vision needs backup now! [Obsidian pulls the Hulkbuster up and kicks it in the small of the back.] [Trying to change into the Hulk while fighting Cull Obsidian in the Hulkbuster armor] Hulk. Hulk, I know you like making your entrance at the last second, well, this is it, man. This is the last, last second. [Bruce extends his left hand protectively; Obsidian grabs the armor's hand, chops the shoulder joint with a relatively small axe then does a roll over Bruce's back to leverage snapping off the Hulkbuster's whole arm] Ahhhhh! Hulk! Hulk! HULK!\
\
Hulk: [Banner's face briefly becomes the Hulk] NOOOO!!!\
\
Bruce Banner: Oh, screw you, ya big green asshole! I'll do it myself! [To Obsidian] Come on!\
\
[He charges the alien, jumps into the air and delivers an effective punch with his remaining hand -- swat, punch, hammer -- except that blow is caught by Obsidian, who punches back, knocking Bruce flat. Obsidian changes his left hand armor into a pointed weapon, and lunges forward to deliver a likely fatal blow, when Bruce grabs the detached Hulkbuster arm out of the water, holding it so Obsidian impales that instead, and slaps the controls.]\
\
Bruce Banner: See you later, Alligator! [The repulsors fire, taking Cull Obsidian high into the air -- high enough, in fact, to intersect the defense dome. The Hulkbuster arm drags Obsidian against the field to grotesque destructive effect, ending in a very final explosion.] Hulk, we got a lot to figure out, pal.\
\
[Proxima Midnight alternates heavy blows between her two opponents, but all three of them duck as a single-wheel Thresher tears overhead, the ditch sparing them most of the danger from the wheel-blades. Proxima uses the distraction to kick Black Widow in the face, sending her to the ground. She then grabs Okoye by the shoulder and weapon and throws her meters away.]\
\
[Simultaneously, Corvus Glaive and Vision struggle in the forest at the foot of Mount Bashenga. Glaive grasps Vision's shoulder and uses the leverage to plunge his blade once more into the android's chest.]\
\
Corvus Glaive: I thought you were formidable, machine. But you're dying, like any man. [He yanks his blade out, and Vision collapses. As he bends over his fallen opponent to retrieve the Stone, he's tackled by Captain America at full speed.]\
\
Steve Rogers: Get outta here! [He exchanges blows with Glaive, using his arm-shields as offence as well as defense, then turns to Vision again] GO!\
\
[Black Widow splits her staff back into a pair of sticks to block Proxima Midnight's sword blows, and finally knocks it from her hand. The alien takes to her bare fists instead, knocks down and pins the Black Widow. Proxima triggers an arm-blade from her left-arm armor, and stabs at Black Widow, who barely manages to block the blade with her crossed sticks. As the edge starts to dig into Black Widow's neck anyway, scarlet energy grabs the alien and tosses her into the air right into the path of another passing Thresher. Dark blue blood spatters the women below. The Scarlet Witch sits up, sighing with relief, her hands still shimmering.]\
\
Natasha Romanoff: That was really gross.\
\
[Captain America keeps blocking Corvus Glaive's staff weapon using his shields, finally knocking it from the alien's hands just before he's thrown over a fallen tree and pinned, Glaive's hand at his throat. Even with his physical abilities, Captain America's struggling -- until a glaive-blade pierces Glaive's chest, and is pushed all the way through. Vision raises his enemy in a perfect mirror of the first attack on him, and holds him for a moment, before dropping Glaive's corpse to one side and collapsing exhaustively.]\
\
Steve Rogers: [helping him back up] I thought I told you to go.\
\
Vision: We don't trade lives, Captain.\
\
[The remaining Guardians and Avengers are dealing with the gravitic aftermath of dumping a large chunk of moon onto an unstable planet's surface. The unconscious Guardians are flying upwards uncontrollably, moon-chunks are still making fiery ballistic in-bounds, and random debris and massive rocks are floating in any possible direction. Spider-Man is well-equipped to handle this physically, even if he's freaking out emotionally.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Webs Mantis] I got you! I got you! [Snags Drax, securing both of them to something not moving] I'm sorry I can't remember anybody's names! [Reels in Star-Lord]\
\
[The Cloak of Levitation sets Doctor Strange down on a relatively stable outcrop as Thanos extricates himself from rubble. The Sorcerer Supreme makes a few passes with his hands, producing the familiar golden magic filigree circles, and slams his hands down on the rock before him, invoking the Seven Suns of Cinnibus as a lightning-like effect of immense heat jumping from rock to rock until it reaches Thanos, sending him flying -- but he makes use of the erratic gravity to keep control and fire back a blast from the Power Stone.]\
\
[Doctor Strange blocks the purple plume with a wall of Mirror Dimension, which he then pushes back at Thanos. It shatters around the Titan, who suctions the magic into a miniature black hole with the Space Stone, volleying it back at Doctor Strange. Just in time, Doctor Strange raises a shield and changes the dark energy into a swarm of aqua butterflies which return to their master.]\
\
[Before Thanos can counterattack again, Doctor Strange levitates and invokes the Images of Ikonn, giving him arms like a Hindu deity before dozens of Strange replications rush away, forming a circular wall around a snarling Thanos. They call cast magical cords, wrapping around Thanos' torso, arms and hands; he struggles to close his gauntleted fist, and uses the Soul and Power Stones to discover the real Doctor Strange among the many copies, blowing the duplicates away and sending the singular Doctor Strange reeling. Reality and Space pull Doctor Strange forward, Thanos grasping him by the throat once in range. Doctor Strange grabs futilely at Thanos' hand.]\
\
Thanos: You're full of tricks, wizard.\
\
Stephen Strange: [as Thanos reaches for the Eye of Agamotto] No!\
\
Thanos: [He snaps the Eye off its chain] Yet you never once used your greatest weapon. [He crushes it in his bare hand] A fake. [He throws Doctor Strange hard enough that Doctor Strange's head hits stone and he passes out.]\
\
[Almost simultaneously, a red and gold device slaps into the palm of the Infinity Gauntlet, bracing the fingers open; and a red and gold Avenger makes a fast and hard entrance.]\
\
Tony Stark: [sounding just about done with the Titan] You throw another moon at me, and I'm gonna to lose it.\
\
Thanos: Stark.\
\
Tony Stark: You know me?\
\
Thanos: I do. You're not the only one cursed with knowledge.\
\
Tony Stark: My only curse is you. [Small rockets pop out of Iron Man's back and launch at Thanos.]\
\
Thanos: Come on!\
\
[The rockets all explode on target, momentarily shrouding Thanos in smoke. Before it clears, Iron Man pile drives into Thanos horizontally, using his single super-jet boot configuration. As he bounces off, he flips and sticks his landing, immediately re-configuring his boots into ground clamps for stability and his gloves into rocket-driven battering rams, punching Thanos into a ruined wall behind him.]\
\
[Thanos shakes it off quickly, reaches forward and tears Iron Man's helmet off, revealing Tony's surprised expression before the suit recovers automatically and re-forms his head protection. The Titan makes use of the fractional delay and punches back hard, sending Iron Man sliding meters away, giving Thanos time to rip the brace device off the gauntlet. He immediately uses the Power Stone to stream furiously lambent energy at his opponent, who forms a shield to kneel behind just as instantly, getting pushed back even further by the incredible force.]\
\
[Iron Man slides out from behind the shield, letting the angled energy push him away for a faster start, and whips back to Thanos full thrusters; he kicks at the Titan with his left foot, turning the boot into a ground clamp at the same time to pin the gauntlet, and keeps twisting while his left glove becomes a ram again, slamming into Thanos' face, cutting his cheek.]\
\
Thanos: [Panting] All that for a drop of blood.\
\
[He smiles briefly punches Iron Man, sending him pinwheeling, then starts beating him with his fists. Iron Man attempts to block the blows with his forearms, but Thanos is relentless, picking him up by the helmet and blasting his midsection with the Power Stone. The gaps in nanite coverage are now gaping, as the armor loses the ability to recover from the intensity and extent of the damage. Iron Man lands hard from the Power blast, struggles to one knee and fires his right hand repulsor at the inexorable Thanos; the beam is easily deflected by the gauntlet. He gets to both feet as the suit tries to complete repairs, adding the beam from his left hand as well. Thanos walks right up to him, and backhands the incomplete helmet completely off Tony's head. He crosses his arms to block a blow from Thanos' gauntlet, and has his left hand caught over his head. In desperation, he forms what's left of his right glove into a short-sword, which is also easily caught by Thanos, snapping it off clean and driving it through Tony's left side. The fight is over.]\
\
[Thanos walks Tony back until he sits, and places the gauntlet almost comfortingly on Tony's head.]\
\
Thanos: You have my respect, Stark. When I'm done, half of humanity will still be alive. [He lets go, straightens and steps back] I hope they remember you.\
\
[Tony's just a little distracted with the pain, and blood drooling out of his mouth, and compromised breathing.]\
\
[Thanos raises the gauntlet, closing his fist, all four Stones glowing]\
\
Stephen Strange: Stop! [Sitting up and sounding entirely damaged] Spare his life... and I will give you the stone.\
\
Thanos: No tricks. [Doctor Strange shakes his head as Thanos points all four Stones at him instead.]\
\
Tony Stark: Don't...!\
\
[Doctor Strange reaches up and plucks the Time Stone out of its hiding place in the stars. He opens his hand, the scars on his fingers and their inherent trembling particularly obvious now, and the Stone floats to Thanos' bare hand. Doctor Strange watches him intently, as he takes the Stone and drops it into the thumb setting, the energy pulse making the Titan wince.]\
\
Thanos: One to go. [An energy blast hits the gauntlet right in the empty Mind Stone setting, and Thanos grimaces in surprise.]\
\
Peter Quill: [Screaming in incoherent rage, helmet up, firing with both hands and flying straight for Thanos.]\
\
[Thanos doesn't even bother responding to the assault -- he just leaves. Star-Lord flies through where Thanos had been and crashes, rolling several times]\
\
Peter Quill: [Standing and de-helmeting] Where is he?!\
\
[Tony stitches up his stab wound as well as he can with his suit functions; he has no breath for answers.]\
\
Peter Quill: [Now fearful instead of furious] Did we just lose?\
\
Tony Stark: [To Doctor Strange, sadly, who has given the Time Stone to Thanos] Why would you do that?\
\
Stephen Strange: We're in the Endgame now.\
\
[M'Baka bashes another Outrider -- the ground game has improved considerably with the addition of the God of Thunder. His tribesmen are equally successful around him.]\
\
M'Baku: MAYEFA!\
\
Jabari Warriors: YA HU HU!\
\
[Thor is in the air, using Stormbringer on the Outrider drop ships which are now retreating. He is having considerably more success than the Wakandan Dragon fliers firing on the fleeing ships.]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: [landing as she finally locates Vision] Are you okay? [Vision flinches in pain before he can answer] What? What is it?\
\
Vision: He's here.\
\
[The wind picks up. It feels... strange. Eerie.]\
\
Steve Rogers: Everyone, on my position. We have incoming. [He is joined by the Black Widow, Falcon, Okoye and the Black Panther in short order.]\
\
Natasha Romanoff: What the hell?\
\
Bruce Banner: [Bruce sees the blue-black clouds of a Space Stone relocation just before Thanos steps forward, and confirms this isn't just another member of the Black Order] Cap. That's him.\
\
Steve Rogers: Eyes up. Stay sharp.\
\
[Bruce reaches Thanos first, lunging forward fist-first -- but Thanos uses the Space Stone on him, renders him immaterial until the Hulkbuster is half-buried in the stone of the cliff behind him, and freezes Bruce in place.]\
\
[Captain America is sent flying by purple energy before he even gets to strike a single blow.]\
\
[The Black Panther, armor fully charged kinetically, leaps high and with claws extended, but is easily grabbed by the throat and punched to the ground, his armor discharging violently.]\
\
[Falcon stoops, strafing with both Steyr pistols, but is felled when his wings become rubbery and unable to sustain flight.]\
\
Vision: Wanda. It's time.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: No.\
\
Vision: They can't stop him, Wanda, but we can. Look at me. You have the power to destroy the stone.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: Don't.\
\
Vision: You must do it. Wanda, please. We. Are. Out of time.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: I can't.\
\
Vision: Yes, you can. You can. If he gets the stone, half the universe dies.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: It's not fair.\
\
Vision: It shouldn't be you, but it is. It's all right. You could never hurt me. I just... feel you. [The Scarlet Witch extends a trembling hand and starts beaming her energy at the Mind Stone.]\
\
[The following action is mostly muted. War Machine joins the fight, firing his guns at Thanos until he uses the gauntlet to crush his armor around him and toss him aside.]\
\
[The Winter Soldier runs in firing, and is punched away by the Power Stone.]\
\
[Okoye activates the Vibranium-powered elements on her spear and flings it; Power stops it inches from Thanos, and throws her and it aside while wrapping the Black Widow in inescapable bands of earth.]\
\
[Groot stabs his hands into the ground to wrap Thanos in cables of roots, which he breaks easily.]\
\
[The Scarlet Witch watches all this over one shoulder, and turns back to Vision to add her left hand to her tearful effort.]\
\
[Captain America slides under one blow and comes up swinging his deployed arm-shields, punching Thanos in the gut and chin. He grabs the gauntlet, keeping Thanos' fingers un-clenched. Thanos looks very briefly impressed at Captain America's efforts as he screams before slamming a fist into his head and rendering him insensible.]\
\
[The Scarlet Witch looks over her shoulder again and sees Thanos approaching unopposed. She swings her left hand around to fend him off with a stream of scarlet energy, and pushes him back despite his blue-purple energy shield, but then he starts to make slow headway.]\
\
Vision: [Very softly] It's all right. It's all right. I love you.\
\
[At those words, the yellow Mind Stone finally starts to crack. Vision's face is overcome by an expression of joyful peace, and as the crystal fragments completely, a pulse of pure yellow energy explodes from him, shuddering the trees for many meters around his epicenter. Wanda's and Thanos' energy subsides.]\
\
Thanos: [Walking closer to the Scarlet Witch] I understand, my child. Better than anyone.\
\
Wanda Maximoff: [Snarls] You could never.\
\
Thanos: [Reaches down to presume to stroke her hair, as if in comfort] Today, I lost more than you can know. But now is no time to mourn. Now... is no time at all. [He reaches forward, clenching the gauntlet, emerald filigree surrounding his wrist, making a gesture very similar to that Doctor Strange made when activating the Eye of Agamotto. In response, a bead of yellow light starts gathering in on itself as time is reversed and growing in size, solidifying into an intact and conscious Vision]\
\
Wanda Maximoff: No! [She lunges for Vision and is swatted away.]\
\
[Thanos picks up Vision by the throat, lifting him to eye-level, and digs the fingers of his right hand into Vision's forehead, digging out the Mind Stone. He pulls it loose, and Vision goes limp and colorless; he tosses the lifeless android aside like trash. Bringing his gauntleted hand up, he slowly moves the Mind Stone over the last empty setting, and drops it in. The energy surge is much more than any previous -- his torso is wreathed with iridescent static and he bellows from the sensations.]\
\
[As Thanos studies the completed gauntlet, a massive bolt of lighting strikes him, digging him into the ground and grinding him back for meters. Thor has arrived, eyes glowing with power, stooping down from the sky like a bird of prey. The God of Thunder pauses his attack, reverses his position, raises Stormbreaker above his head and hurls it -- Thanos fires the whole might of the gauntlet against it, but it only creates a rainbow-like bow-shock, not slowing the ax as it slams right into Thanos' chest. ]\
\
Thor: [Lands in front of Thanos, who is down on one knee; hatefully.] I told you. You'd die for that! [reffering to the deaths of Loki and Heimdall]\
\
[He takes hold of the back of Thanos' head and forces Stormbreaker deeper into his chest, staring angrily into his eyes while Thanos cries out in pain]\
\
Thanos: [Weakly] You should have... you... [suddenly stronger] You should have gone for the head! [He raises his gauntlet and snaps his fingers.]\
\
Thor: NO!\
\
[The scene whites out. It cuts sharply to a view of Thanos his hand on his chest, no wounds visible. Thanos now seems to be inside the Soul Stone, where he sees a child and the pavilion from the home world of the Zen-Whoberi.]\
\
Thanos: Daughter?\
\
[the child turns around revealing to be Young Gamora.]\
\
Gamora: Did you do it?\
\
Thanos: Yes.\
\
Gamora: [Beat] What did it cost?\
\
Thanos: [Solemnly] Everything.\
\
[Now out of the Soul World, Thanos is snapped back to normal reality, and notices the damage inflicted on the gauntlet -- the metal scorched and distorted from heat, the stones no longer glowing.]\
\
Thor: What'd you do? [Angrily] WHAT'D YOU DO?!\
\
[Thanos nearly seems to not notice Thor before he uses the Space Stone and teleports away, leaving Stormbreaker behind on Wakandan ground.]\
\
Steve Rogers: [Stumbles into the clearing, holding his left side] Where'd he go? Thor... where'd he go?\
\
Bucky Barnes: Steve?\
\
[Bucky suddenly stumbles over, drops his gun and collapses into ashes, much to Steve's shock; he walks over and touches the ground where Bucky's ashes evaporated disbelievingly.]\
\
[On the battlefield, Wakandan soldiers disintegrate to ashes, much to M'Baku's horror.]\
\
T'Challa: [While reaching for a fallen Okoye] Up, General. Up! This is no place to die. [King T'Challa holds out his hand for Okoye. He suddenly disintegrates into ashes and, in anguish, Okoye falls back on the ground. Few seconds later, she gets up herself.]\
\
Okoye: Kumkani?!\
\
Groot: [Slowly corrodes into ashes as well by Rocket] I am Groot... [TRANSLATION: "Dad?"]\
\
[off-screen Okoye repeats herself]\
\
Rocket: No... no. No. No. No! Groot, no...\
\
[Wanda is mourning over Vision. She then turns into ashes. An injured Sam turns to ashes, hidden in the undergrowth.]\
\
James Rhodes: [Searching for Sam, missing him by only a few feet] Sam? [Back to Okoye is is whimpering for her disintegrated king] Sam, where you at?!\
\
[On Titan, the remaining members of the Guardians and Avengers collect themselves -- Mantis props up Star-Lord, Spider-Man helps Tony to his feet, Drax and Nebula manage to limp over on their own.]\
\
Mantis: Something's happening. [She disintegrates into ashes.]\
\
[Quill looks behind him as he sees Drax disintegrate]\
\
Drax: [To Quill as he dissolves] Quill?\
\
[Quill stares in horror as he turns back to Stark.]\
\
Tony Stark: [Staring panicked at the slowly fading Quill] Steady, Quill.\
\
Peter Quill: Aw, man. [Quill also gets disintegrated into ashes]\
\
Stephen Strange: [Calmly turns to Stark] Tony, there was no other way. [He finally gets erased.]\
\
Peter Parker: [Realizes he's fading away] Mr. Stark? [Stark stares horrified at Parker,] I don't feel so good...\
\
Tony Stark: [Trying to be calm, his voice shaking as he looks at Peter in terror] You're all right?\
\
Peter Parker: [Stumbling and terrified] I don't know what's -- I don't know what's happening. I don't-- [Parker falls into Stark's arms, clutching him tight while beginning to cry.] I don't wanna go, I don't wanna go, Mr. Stark, please. Please, I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go... [There is a short silence before Peter speaks again] I'm sorry. [Parker disintegrates into ashes in Stark's arms.]\
\
[Tony falls forward from the lack of weight in his arms, before staring at his hands in disbelief.]\
\
Nebula: [To Tony Stark, seeing Thanos' victory.] He did it.\
\
[Stark mourns silently at their failure. Back on Wakanda, the remaining team members, Captain America, Thor, War Machine, Black Widow, Bruce Banner, and Rocket are left mourning near Vision's dead body. Captain America turns over Vision's bleached corpse as Black Widow runs up to the other survivors.]\
\
James Rhodes: What is this? What the hell is happening?\
\
Steve Rogers: [Pause] Oh, God.\
\
[Meanwhile, in a different place, in a rustic house on a terraced slope with a scarecrow made of discarded armor, Thanos sits down and watches the sun rise.]\
\
[In the mid-credits scene, nothing is shown. But 2 voices are heard.]\
\
Nick Fury: Still no word from Stark?\
\
Maria Hill: No, not yet. We're watching every satellite in both hemispheres, there's still nothing. [Receives three beeps from her device.]\
\
[The screen now shows Nick Fury and Maria Hill on Earth, driving in a car.]\
\
Nick Fury: What is it?\
\
Maria Hill: Multiple bogeys over Wakanda.\
\
Nick Fury: Same energy signatures as New York?\
\
Maria Hill: Ten times bigger.\
\
Nick Fury: Tell Klein. We'll meet him at- -\
\
Maria Hill: [warning] Nick, Nick! [A car spirals out of control in front of them. They get out and Hill checks on the passengers.]\
\
Nick Fury: They okay?\
\
[Behind their vehicle, a motorcycle lies in the middle of the street with a concerned citizen approaching it.]\
\
Maria Hill: There's no one here.\
\
[They hear helicopter rotor sounds from the direction they'd come, but it sounds wrong -- a Leonardo executive helicopter, tail rotor smoking from damage already, appears and crashes nose-first into a building. Screaming intensifies. The two are now witnessing civilians around them suddenly disintegrating.]\
\
Nick Fury: Call Control. Code Red.\
\
Maria Hill: [looks at her hands] Nick?\
\
[Fury turns around to see Hill disintegrating.]\
\
Nick Fury: Hill?\
\
[Fury then races back to their car and gets a what appears to be an old pager with extra gear attached out of his bag on the back seat. He sends out an emergency alert, mere seconds before his hand turns into ashes.]\
\
Nick Fury: Oh, no. Motherf--\
\
[Before he could finish the line, Fury corrodes to dust. The pager falls to the ground, red lights blinking on the additions; the camera zooms in and we see the device display "SENDING..." then display a red-blue-and-gold star insignia -- the symbol of Captain Marvel.] [Cut to black.]\

The end.\
\
[1991, a HYDRA base in a snowy landscape. A man enters a bunker and removes a red book marked with a black star.]\

[Bucky Barnes is secured in a chair, a mechanical device either side of his head causing him to scream in pain.]\

[Marvel Opening Credits]\
[Lagos, present day]\
[Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, adds sugar to a cup and stirs it. She looks around.]\
Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?\
Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It\'92s a good target.\
Steve Rogers: There\'92s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .\
Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.\
Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.\
Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.\
Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?\
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It\'92s cute.\
[Camera pans to show Natasha sitting two tables from Wanda]\
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.\
Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?\
Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.\
Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?\
Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?\
Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.\
Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.\
[A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]\
Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.\
[From the back of Sam\'92s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]\
Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.\
[weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]\
Sam Wilson: That truck\'92s loaded for max weight. And the driver\'92s armed.\
Natasha Romanoff: It\'92s a battering ram.\
Steve Rogers: Go now.\
Wanda Maximoff: What?\
Steve Rogers: He\'92s not hitting the police.\
[INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES]\
[A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck is coming towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the gateway. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made entrance.]\
[Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]\
[Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]\
Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles.\
[Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]\
Sam Wilson: I make 5.\
[Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]\
Wanda Maximoff: Sam.\
[Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]\
Sam Wilson: Four.\
[Sam's drone flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]\
Sam Wilson: Rumlow\'92s on the third floor.\
Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.\
Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?\
Steve Rogers: Get it out.\
[Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]\
[Rumlow is inside. He punches down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a container labeled "bio-hazard."]\
Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.\
[In another area, Steve is behind a pillar. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]\
[Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees that Steve\'92s team is here.]\
Brock Rumlow: He\'92s here.\
[Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]\
Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.\
[Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]\
Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I\'92m on it.\
[She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier. She takes out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto an armored vehicle. She electrocutes him.]\
Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.\
[He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]\
Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.\
Mercenary: No!\
[Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out.]\
[Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow.]\
Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.\
[Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]\
Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.\
[The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]\
Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?\
Brock Rumlow: I\'92m not.\
[Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]\
Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.\
[Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]\
Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.\
[Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]\
Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.\
[Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]\
Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I\'92ve been waiting for this!\
[Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]\
Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I\'92m empty.\
[Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!\
[She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]\
Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I\'92ll drop this. Drop it!\
Mercenary #2: He'll do it!\
[Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.\
Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.\
Natasha Romanoff: I\'92m\'85 not thanking that thing.\
Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.\
Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.\
[Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]\
Brock Rumlow: Come on!\
[Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]\
Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.\
[Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]\
Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.\
Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?\
Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.\
Steve Rogers: What did you say?\
Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, "Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go." And you're coming with me.\
[He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and covers her mouth in shock.]\
Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up, open mouthed.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.\
[Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]\
Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.\
Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?\
[Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]\
Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.\
Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.\
Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?\
Young Tony Stark: Candice.\
[Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]\
Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.\
Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?\
Maria Stark: You father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.\
Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.\
Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.\
[Maria stops playing the piano.]\
Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.\
[He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]\
Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.\
[Howard walks back in.]\
Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.\
[Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]\
Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.\
[He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]\
Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.\
[He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]\
Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.\
[The crowd chuckles.]\
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.\
[The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]\
Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes\'85 just re-frame the future! Starting now.\
[The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]\
Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.\
[He exits the stage.]\
MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .\
[Tony is not listening.]\
Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?\
MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.\
Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.\
Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.\
MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.\
[Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]\
Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.\
Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.\
Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?\
[He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]\
Tony Stark: Are you going up?\
Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.\
[She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]\
Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.\
Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.\
[She shoves a photo at him.]\
Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.\
[Tony shakes his head.]\
Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.\
[She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]\
[At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]\
News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.\
King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.\

[Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]\
News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.\
[Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]\
News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -\
[The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]\
Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.\
Steve Rogers: That's not true.\
Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.\
Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.\
[He walks over.]\
Steve Rogers: Rumlow said "Bucky" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]\
Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.\
Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.\
Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.\
[Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]\
[Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda\'92s room]\
Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.\
Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .\
[He gestures at the door and stops.]\
Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.\
Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.\
Steve Rogers: We know who it is?\
Vision: The Secretary of State.\
[The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]\
[The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]\
Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word "vigilantes".\
Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?\
Secretary Ross: How about "dangerous"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?\
[Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]\
Secretary Ross: New York.\
[A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]\
[Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]\
Secretary Ross: Washington DC.\
[The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]\
[Sam looks down.]\
Secretary Ross: Sokovia.\
[Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]\
[Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]\
Secretary Ross: Lagos.\
[The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]\
[Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]\
Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.\
[Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]\
Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]\
[An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]\
Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.\
Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.\
Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?\
[Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]\
Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.\
James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.\
Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.\
[Steve glances at Tony.]\
Secretary Ross: Talk it over.\
Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?\
Secretary Ross: Then you retire.\
[Natasha stifles a smile.]\
[Cleveland.]\
[Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]\
Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?\
[Zemo comes to the door.]\
Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.\
[Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]\
Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.\
Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.\
Helmut Zemo: Thank you.\
[Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]\
[Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]\
Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.\
[Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]\
Helmut Zemo: "Mission report: December 16, 1991."\
Vasily Karpov: Who are you?\
Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.\
Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?\
Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.\
Vasily Karpov: What do you want?\
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.\
Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.\
[Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]\
Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.\
[Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]\
Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.\
[Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]\
[The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]\
James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.\
Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?\
James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it. "\
Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?\
Vision: I have an equation.\
Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.\
Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.\
Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?\
Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.\
James Rhodes: Boom.\
[Tony is lying on the couch, one hand over his face. When Natasha speaks, he removes the hand to look at her.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.\
Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.\
Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.\
[He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]\
Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.\
[He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]\
Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?\
[He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]\
Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.\
[The others look affected by this .]\
Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]\
Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.\
Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.\
Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?\
Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.\
James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.\
Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.\
Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.\
Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.\
Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.\
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.\
Vision: We would protect you.\
Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.\
[Tony looks at her, surprised.]\
Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -\
Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.\
Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.\
Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.\
[Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']\
Steve Rogers: I have to go.\
[Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]\
[London.]\
[A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]\
[At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads "Margaret 'Peggy' Carter". The priest addresses the mourners.]\
Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.\
[Agent 13, Steve's "neighbor" from DC, steps up to the podium.]\
[Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]\
Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.\
[Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]\
Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.\
[She looks directly at Steve.]\
Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say " No, you move."\
[Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]\
Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.\
Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.\
Steve Rogers: Who else signed?\
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.\
Steve Rogers: Clint?\
Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.\
[She smiles slightly.]\
Steve Rogers: Wanda?\
Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.\
[Steve sighs and bows his head.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.\
[Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]\
Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?\
[She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]\
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.\
Natasha Romanoff: I know.\
Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?\
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.\
[She pulls him in for a hug.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Come here.\
[Vienna.]\
[The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]\
News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.\
[T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]\
UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?\
Natasha Romanoff: Yes?\
UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.\
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.\
T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.\
T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.\
T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.\
Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?\
T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.\
King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.\
T'Challa: Father.\
King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.\
Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.\
King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.\
Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.\
Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.\
T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.\
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]\
King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.\
T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.\
King T'Chaka: Thank you.\
T'Challa: Thank you.\
King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.\
T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!\
[An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]\
[A hotel.]\
Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.\
Steve Rogers: Very practical.\
Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]\
Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?\
Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.\
Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.\
Sharon Carter: I know, right?\
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .\
Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.\
Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?\
Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.\
Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]\
Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.\
News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .\
Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?\
News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.\
Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?\
News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.\
Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.\
[Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]\
Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.\
T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.\
Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.\
T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.\
Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.\
T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]\
[Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?\
Steve Rogers: You alright?\
Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.\
Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?\
Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.\
Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.\
Natasha Romanoff: Why?\
Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]\
Natasha Romanoff: Shit.\
[Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]\
Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.\
Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.\
Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]\
Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you.\
Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.\

German Innkeeper: Herr M\'fcller, ich habe Ihr Fr\'fchst\'fcck. ([subtitled] Mr. M\'fcller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]\
Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)\

[Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]\
Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])\
[In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]\
[In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]\
Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.\
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?\
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.\
Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.\
Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.\
Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.\
Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.\
Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.\
Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.\
Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.\
[Armed cops run upstairs.]\
Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.\
[Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]\
Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.\
Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.\
Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?\
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.\
Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!\
Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.\
Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]\
GSG-9 Soldier: Schie\'df die T\'fcr auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]\
Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.\
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.\
[Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]\
GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verd\'e4chtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am \'f6stlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)\
[Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]\
Steve Rogers: Come on, man.\
[Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]\
[A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]\
[Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]\
Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.\
Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?\
Steve Rogers: About to find out.\
[Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]\
Steve Rogers: Sam.\
Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]\
[Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]\
GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]\
[Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]\
Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.\
Sam Wilson: Right behind you.\
[Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]\
[Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]\
[A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]\
James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]\
GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)\
James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]\
[Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]\
Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]\
Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?\
Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.\
Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.\
Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .\
Wanda Maximoff: May I?\
Vision: Please. Wanda?\
Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.\
Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]\
Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.\
Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.\
Wanda Maximoff: Are you?\
Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]\
Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.\
Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.\
Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?\
Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.\
Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.\
Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?\
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?\
Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.\
Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.\
Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.\
Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?\
Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]\
[Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]\
Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?\
Steve Rogers: Sam.\
Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?\
Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?\
T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]\
[In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]\
Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?\
Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.\
Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.\
Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?\
Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.\
Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]\
[On a covered sky walk.]\
Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?\
T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.\
Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.\
Steve Rogers: He's alive.\
Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.\
Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.\
Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.\
Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?\
Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.\
Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?\
Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.\
Sam Wilson: That's cold.\
Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.\
[At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]\
Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)\
[In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]\
[Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]\
Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.\
Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.\
Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?\
Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.\
Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .\
Steve Rogers: Pregnant?\
Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.\
Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.\
Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.\
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.\
Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.\
Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.\
Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.\
Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.\
Tony Stark: No, you don't.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .\
Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.\
Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .\
Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?\
Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.\
Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .\
Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.\
Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.\
Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.\
Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.\
Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.\
Steve Rogers: She's a kid!\
Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]\
Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?\
Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.\
Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.\
Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]\
Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.\
Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.\
[At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]\
Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine gro\'dfe f\'fcr dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)\
Custodian: Hier? (Here?)\
Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]\
[At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]\
Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?\
Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?\
Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.\
Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.\
Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.\
Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.\
Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]\
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.\
Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?\
Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.\
Helmut Zemo: You fear that\'85 if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.\
[At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]\
Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)\
Delivery Truck Driver: Ich wei\'df es nicht. (I don't know.)\
[The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]\
Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.\
Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.\
Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]\
[In Bucky's pod.]\
Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?\
Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.]

Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.\
[Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]\
Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?\
Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.\
[As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]\
[In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]\
Man on PA #1: Der Ostfl\'fcgel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostfl\'fcgel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)\
Sam Wilson: Hey.\
[Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]\
[In the control room.]\
Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.\
Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.\
Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.\
Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]\
[Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]\
[Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]\
[Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]\
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.\
[Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]\
Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.\
[T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]\
[Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]\
Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]\
[Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]\
[At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]\
Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.\
[Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]\
News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)\
[Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']\
[In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]\
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]\
Bucky Barnes: Steve.\
Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?\
Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.\
Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.\
Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?\
Bucky Barnes: What did I do?\
Steve Rogers: Enough.\
Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.\
Steve Rogers: Who was he?\
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.\
Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than "I don't know."\
Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.\
Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?\
Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.\
[1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]\
[Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]\
Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]\
[Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]\
[Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.\

[Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]\
Steve Rogers: Who were they?\
Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.\
Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?\
Bucky Barnes: Worse.\
Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?\
Bucky Barnes: Enough.\
Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.\
Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.\
Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.\
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .\
Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.\
Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .\
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.\
Steve Rogers: We're on our own.\
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.\
Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?\
Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.\
Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.\
Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?\
Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.\
Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.\
Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?\
Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.\
Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.\
Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony rubs his hand on his chest and slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?\
Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?\
Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.\
Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.\
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?\
Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?\
Tony Stark: No.\
Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.\
Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?\
Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]\
[Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]\
Peter Parker: Hey, May.\
May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?\
Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]\
Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.\
Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.\
Tony Stark: Tony.\
Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?\
Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?\
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.\
Tony Stark: Right?\
Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .\
May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.\
Peter Parker: About the grant.\
Tony Stark: The September Foundation.\
Peter Parker: Right.\
Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?\
Peter Parker: Yeah.\
Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.\
May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?\
Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?\
Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.\
Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.\
Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.\
May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?\
Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.\
Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.\
Tony Stark: Yeah?\
Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
Peter Parker: Yeah?\
Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.\
Peter Parker: Wow.\
Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?\
May Parker: Sure.\
Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?\
Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.\
Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.\
Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.\
Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.\
Peter Parker: Okay.\
Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?\
Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?\
Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.\
Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.\
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.\
Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?\
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?\
Peter Parker: Exactly.\
Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?\
Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .\
Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?\
Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.\
Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.\
Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!\
Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?\
Peter Parker: Nobody.\
Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?\
Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.\
Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?\
Peter Parker: I did.\
Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?\
Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .\
Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?\
Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that\'85 when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.\
Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?\
Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.\
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.\
Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.\
Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.\
Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.\
Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?\
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.\
Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?\
Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.\
Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?\
Peter Parker: No.\
Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.\
Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!\
Tony Stark: Why?\
Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.\
Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.\
Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!\
Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.\
Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.\
Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.\
Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .\
[Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]\
Wanda Maximoff: What is it?\
Vision: Stay here, please.\
[Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]\
Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.\
Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?\
Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.\
Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.\
Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.\
Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.\
Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.\
Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.\
Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]\
Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.\
Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.\
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.\
Vision: I can't let you.\
Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.\
Vision: [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.\
Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]\
Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.\
[Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]\
Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.\
Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.\
T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .\
Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?\
T'Challa: My resources are considerable.\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.\
T'Challa: You know where they are.\
Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.\
[Under an overpass:]\
Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.\
Steve Rogers: It's low profile.\
Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]\
Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?\
Sam Wilson: No.\
Steve Rogers: I owe you again.\
Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.\
Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.\
Sharon Carter: I know.\
[They kiss.]\
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.\
Sharon Carter: That was . . .\
Steve Rogers: Late.\
Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.\
Steve Rogers: Okay.\
[On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]\
Clint Barton: Cap.\
Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.\
Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.\
Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.\
Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.\
Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?\
Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but\'85 he should be good.\
Scott Lang: What timezone is this?\
Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.\
Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.\
Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.\
Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!\
Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?\
Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .\
Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.\
Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?\
Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?\
Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.\
Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?\
Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.\
Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.\
Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere m\'fcssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)\
Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.\
Sam Wilson: Stark.\
Scott Lang: Stark?\
Steve Rogers: Suit up.\
[Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]\
Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?\
James Rhodes: Definitely weird.\
Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.\
T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.\
Steve Rogers: Your highness.\
Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?\
Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.\
Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.\
Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.\
Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?\
Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.\
Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit\'85 Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.\
Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .\
Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.\
Tony Stark: . . . Good job.\
Steve Rogers: You've been busy.\
Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.\
Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.\
Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.\
Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.\
Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .\
James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?\
Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.\
Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?\
James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.\
T'Challa: Barnes is mine!\
Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?\
Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.\
Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!\
T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.\
Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.\
Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]\
Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?\
Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.\
Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]\
[Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]\
[Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]\
James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]\
Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.\
Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.\
Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.\
Clint Barton: Hey, man.\
Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?\
Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]\
Tony Stark: First time for everything.\
Clint Barton: Made you look.\
[Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]\
FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.\
[Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]\
Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?\
Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?\
Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.\
Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.\
Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, I'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!\
Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?\
Sam Wilson: I hate you.\
[Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]\
James Rhodes: Great.\
Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]\
James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]\
Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]\
James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.\
Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?\
Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?\
Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.\
Steve Rogers: Come on!\
[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]\
Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]\
Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?\
Steve Rogers: We fight.\
Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]\
Peter Parker: They're not stopping.\
Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]\
[Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]\
Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?\
Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]\
Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]\
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.\
T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]\
[Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]\
Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.\
Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.\
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]\
Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?\
Clint Barton: Buckled in?\
Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]\
Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?\
Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]\
Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?\
Peter Parker: Queens.\
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]\
Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?\
FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.\
Tony Stark: They what?\
Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.\
Tony Stark: Who's speaking?\
Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.\
Tony Stark: Friday?\
FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.\
Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]\
Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.\
Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.\
Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.\
Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.\
Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.\
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?\
Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.\
Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.\
Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?\
Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?\
Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]\
Peter Parker: Holy shit!\
James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.\
Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.\
Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!\
Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]\
Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]\
[Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]\
Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.\
[Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]\
Scott Lang: You wanna get to them\'85 you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]\
[Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]\
Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.\
T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]\
[Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]\
James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]\
Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]\
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.\
Steve Rogers: You know I can't.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]\
Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?\
James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?\
Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.\
Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]\
Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.\
James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.\
Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]\
Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?\
Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?\
Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!\
Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.\
Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.\
Tony Stark: Yeah.\
Peter Parker: That was scary.\
Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?\
Peter Parker: What?\
Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.\
Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.\
Tony Stark: Stay down.\
Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!\
Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!\
Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.\
Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.\
Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.\
Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.\
Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.\
[Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]\
James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.\
[Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]\
Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]\
James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]\
Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.\
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.\
Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]\
[Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]\
German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)\
Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)\
German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr M\'fcller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee f\'fcr Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. M\'fcller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)\
Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)\
[In his room in Berlin, Germany.]\
German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Fr\'fchst\'fcck ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr M\'fcller? Herr M\'fcller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr M\'fcller? Mr M\'fcller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]\
[Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]\
Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?\
Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is\'85 I'll deal with it.\
Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.\
Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.\
Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.\
[At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]\
Tony Stark: How did this happen?\
Vision: I became distracted.\
Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.\
Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]\
[Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]\
Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.\
Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.\
Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.\
Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.\
Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.\
Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?\
Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]\
Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?\
FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.\
Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.\
[Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]\
FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.\
Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?\
FRIDAY: What do I look like?\
Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.\
FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.\
Tony Stark: Must be.\
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.\
Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?\
FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.\
Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.\
FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.\
[A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.\
Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: '
\f1 \uc0\u1076 \u1077 \u1082 \u1072 \u1073 \u1088 \u1103 
\f0  1991' (December 1991).\
Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]\
[Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]\
Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.\
[The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]\
Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.\
Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]\
[Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]\
Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.\
Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.\
Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .\
Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.\
Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.\
Clint Barton: Yeah.\
Tony Stark: I didn't make you.\
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .\
Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.\
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la\'85\
Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]\
Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.\
Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.\
Tony Stark: Who are you?\
Scott Lang: Come on, man.\
Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?\
Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?\
Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?\
Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.\
Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.\
Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.\
Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!\
Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.\
Sam Wilson: That's a first.\
Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to\'85\
Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you\'85 but you have to go alone and as a friend.\
Tony Stark: Easy.\
[Tony walks to his chopper.]\
Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?\
Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]\
[Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]\
[Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.\
On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.\
Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]\
Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?\
Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?\
Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.\
Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?\
Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.\
Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.\
Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]\
[Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]\
Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.\
Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.\
[Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]\
Steve Rogers: You ready?\
Bucky Barnes: Yeah.\
[Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]\
Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.\
[Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]\
Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.\
Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.\
Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?\
Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.\
Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.\
Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]\
[the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]\
[With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]\
Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.\
Steve Rogers: How many?\
Tony Stark: Uh, one.\
[As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]\
Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?\
Bucky Barnes: What the hell?\
Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.\
Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.\
Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.\
Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]\
Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.\
Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?\
Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.\
Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?\
Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.\
Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?\
[The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.\
Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.\
[The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]\
Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?\
Maria Stark: Howard!\
[Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]\
Maria Stark: Howard!\
[In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.\
Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]\
Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.\
Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?\
Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.\
Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?\
Steve Rogers: Yes.\
[Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]\
Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!\
[As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]\
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!\
Tony Stark: Move!\
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!\
[Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]\
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.\
Tony Stark: Ah crap.\
[Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]\
Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.\
[As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]\
Tony Stark: Come on, come on.\
FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.\
Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?\
Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.\
[Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]\
Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.\
Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.\
[They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]\
[Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]\
Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.\
T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.\
Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.\
T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.\
Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, "Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm." When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.\
T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.\
Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]\
T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.\
[Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]\
FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.\
Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.\
FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.\
Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]\
Steve Rogers: He's my friend.\
Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.\
Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.\
[Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]\
Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]\
[In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]\
Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?\
Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?\
[Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]\
Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.\
James Rhodes: Yeah.\
Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?\
James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]\
Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.\
James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]\
Tony Stark: You okay?\
James Rhodes: Oh yeah.\
FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony "Stank"?\
James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.\
[Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]\
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]\
FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.\
Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.\
Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.\
Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .\
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.\
[Wakanda, medical facility.]\
Steve Rogers: You sure about this?\
Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]\
[Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]\
Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.\
T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace\'85\
Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.\
T'Challa: Let them try.\
[In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]\
May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?\
Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]\
May Parker: What's "some guy's" name?\
Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.\
May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?\
Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.\
May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.\
Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.\
May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]\
Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]\
[the final screen text shows 'Spider-Man will return']\

SHIELD Lieutenant: How come nobody spotted it before?\
Search Team Leader: It\'92s really not that surprising. This landscape\'92s changing all the time. You got any ideas what this thing is exactly?\
SHIELD Lieutenant: I don\'92t know. It\'92s probably a weather balloon.\

Johann Schmidt: It has taken me a long time to find this place. [to the Tower Keeper] You should be commended. [to one of his soldiers] Help him up.\
[one of the soldiers helps the tower keeper to his feet]\
Johann Schmidt: I think that you are man of great vision. And in this way we are much alike.\
Tower Keeper: I am nothing like you.\
Johann Schmidt: No, of course. But what others see as superstition, you and I know to be a science.\
Tower Keeper: What you seek is just a legend.\
Johann Schmidt: Then why make such an effort to conceal it? [opens an old tomb and picks up the glass cube from the skeletal remains of an old Viking] The Tesseract was the jewel of Odin\'92s treasure room. [he turns to face the tower keeper and deliberately drops and smashes the glass cube] It\'92s not something one buries. But I think it is close, yes?\
Tower Keeper: I cannot help you.\
Johann Schmidt: No. But maybe you can help your village. You must have some friends out there. Some\'85 some little grandchildren perhaps. I have no need for them to die. [A big tank outside turns his guns towards the village threateningly.]\
[referring to the carving of the tree on one of the tower walls]\
Johann Schmidt: Yggdrasil. Tree of the world. Guardian of wisdom and fate, also. [he presses a button on the carving of the tree and it opens up to reveal the real cube] And the F\'fchrer digs for trinkets in the desert. You have never seen this, have you?\
Tower Keeper: It\'92s not for the eyes of ordinary men.\
Johann Schmidt: Exactly. [he closes the box containing the glowing cube and turns to his soldiers] Gove the order to open fire.\
Hydra Lieutenant: Jawohl! (Yes!)\
Tower Keeper: Fool! You cannot control the power you hold. You will burn!\
Johann Schmidt: I already have. [He shoots and kills the tower keeper]\
[In New York, at the enrollment facility.]\
4F Doctor: [off-screen] O\'92Connel, Michael. Kaminsky, Henry.\
Steve Rogers: Boy, a lot of guys getting killed over there.\
4F Doctor: [off-screen] Rogers, Steven.\
[Steve puts down the newspaper he is reading]\
Enlistment Guy: It kind of makes you think twice about enlisting, huh?\
Steve Rogers: Nope.\
[as Steve is standing half naked in front of the doctor to examine him for enlistment]\
4F Doctor: Rogers. What did your father die of?\
Steve Rogers: Mustard gas. He was in the hundred and seventh infantry. I was hoping I could be assigned\'85\
4F Doctor: Your mother?\
Steve Rogers: She was a nurse in a TB ward. Got hit, couldn\'92t shake it. [the doctor looks at Steve\'92s file which shows he has a long list of health issues]\
4F Doctor: Sorry, son.\
Steve Rogers: Look, just give me a chance.\
4F Doctor: You\'92d be ineligible on your asthma alone.\
Steve Rogers: Is there anything you can do?\
4F Doctor: I\'92m doing it. I\'92m saving your life. [He stamps the card 4F.]\
[later, Steve is at the movie theater]\
[a commercial about the war is playing before the movie]\
Commercial Announcer: War continues to ravage Europe. But help is on the way. Every able-bodied young man is lining up to serve his country. Even little Timmy is doing his part collecting scrap metal. Nice work, Timmy!\
Loud Jerk: Who cares? Play the movie already!\
Steve Rogers: [quietly] Hey, you wanna show some respect?\
Commercial Announcer: Meanwhile, overseas, our brave boys are showing the Axis powers that the price freedom is never too high.\
Loud Jerk: Let\'92s got! Get on with it! Hey, just start the cartoon!\
Steve Roger: Hey buddy, you wanna shut up?!\
[the guy gets up and looks at him]\
Commercial Announcer: Together with Allied forces, we\'92ll face any threat, no matter the size.\
[getting beaten in an alley by the loud jerk that was disturbing everyone at the cinema]\
Loud Jerk: You just don\'92t know when to give up, do you?\
Steve Rogers: I can do this all day. [and attacks the guy again]\
James Barnes: Hey! Pick on someone your own size.\
[after saving Steve from getting any further beatings by the loud jerk]\
James Barnes: Sometimes, I think you like getting punched.\
Steve Rogers: I had him on the ropes.\
[picks up Steve\'92s enlistment form from the ground]\
James Barnes: How many times is this?\
[reading from the enlistment form]\
James Barnes: Oh, you\'92re from Paramus now? You know it\'92s illegal to lie on the enlistment form. And seriously, Jersey?\
Steve Rogers: You get your orders?\
James Barnes: The one-o-seventh. Sergeant James Barnes. Shipping out for England first thing tomorrow.\
Steve Rogers: I should be going.\
James Barnes: Come on, man. My last night! Gotta get you cleaned up.\
Steve Rogers: Why? Where are we going?\
James Barnes: The future.\
[he hands him the newspaper he was holding, Steve opens it to see the ad for World Exposition Of Tomorrow, 1943]\
James Barnes: I don\'92t see what the problem is. You\'92re about to be the last eligible man in New York. You know, there\'92s three and a half million women here.\
Steve Rogers: Well, I\'92d settle for just one.\
James Barnes: Good thing I took care of that.\
[He waves to the dates, Connie and Bonnie, he\'92s lined up]\
Connie: Hey, Bucky!\
Steve Rogers: What did you tell her about me?\
James Barnes: Only the good stuff.\
[music starts playing]\
Expo Announcer: Welcome to the Modern Marvels Paviliion and the World of Tomorrow. A greater world. A better world.\
Connie: Oh, my God! It\'92s starting!\
Mandy: Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Howard Stark!\
[Howard enters the stage and kisses the announcer]\
Random Woman: I love you, Howard!\
Howard Stark: [addressing the audience at the World Exposition fair] Ladies and gentlemen, what if I told you that in just a few short years, your automobile won\'92t even have to touch the ground at all.\
[the female helpers take the wheels of the car on stage]\
Howard Stark: Yes. Thanks, Mandy. [addressing the audience again] With Stark robotic reversion technology, you\'92ll be able to do just that.\
[he turns on the switch of his machine and the car starts to hover off the ground]\
James Barnes: Holy cow.\
[the robots making the car hover suddenly malfunction and the car falls back on stage]\
Howard Stark: I did say a few years, didn\'92t I?\
[everyone laughs]\
[Steve disappears, and Bucky notices]\
James Barnes: Hey, Steve, what do you say we treat these girls\'85\
[at a recruitment center]\
Woman: [to her male company, pulling him away from a mirror making him look like a soldier] Come on, soldier.\
[Steve steps in front of the mirror but he\'92s too short to fill out the face]\
James Barnes: Come on. You\'92re kind of missing the point of a double date. We\'92re taking the girls dancing.\
Steve Rogers: You go ahead. I\'92ll catch up with you.\
James Barnes: You\'92re really gonna do this again?\
Steve Rogers: Well, it\'92s a fair. I\'92m gonna try my luck.\
James Barnes: As who? Steve from Ohio? They\'92ll catch you. Or worse, they\'92ll actually take you.\
Steve Rogers: Look, I know you don\'92t think I can do this.\
James Barnes: This isn\'92t a back alley, Steve. It\'92s war!\
Steve Rogers: I know it\'92s a war. You don\'92t have to tell me.\
James Barnes: Why are you so keen to fight? There are so many important jobs.\
Steve Rogers: What am I gonna do? Collect scrap metal\'85\
James Barnes: Yes!\
Steve Rogers: \'85in my little red wagon.\
James Barnes: Why not?\
Steve Rogers: I\'92m not gonna sit in a factory, Bucky.\
James Barnes: I don\'92t\'85\
Steve Rogers: Bucky, come on! There are men laying down their lives. I got no right to do any less than them. That\'92s what you don\'92t understand. This isn\'92t about me.\
James Barnes: Right. Cause you got nothing to prove.\
Connie: Hey, Sarge! Are we going dancing?\
James Barnes: [he turns to the girls] Yes, we are. [back to Steve] Don\'92t do anything stupid until I get back.\
Steve Rogers: How can I? You\'92re taking all the stupid with you.\
James Barnes: You\'92re a punk.\
[he walks back towards Steve and hugs him goodbye]\
Steve Rogers: Jerk. Be careful.\
[as James is walking away]\
Steve Rogers: Don\'92t win the war till I get there!\
James Barnes: [He salutes then starts to walk away] Come on girls. They\'92re playing our song.\
[Steve is in a medical examination room when a nurse whispers something inaudible to Young Doctor]\
Young Doctor: Wait here.\
Steve Rogers: Is there a problem?\
Young Doctor: Just wait here. [walks out]\
[Steve looks at a sign warning against lying on your enlistment form and starts to get ready to leave]\
[An Enlistment Office MP walks in the room and Steve looks up at him worriedly]\
[Dr. Abraham Erskine enters the room as Enlistment Office MP quietly leaves]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [to the MP] Thank you. [to Steve] So, you want to go overseas. Kill some Nazis.\
Steve Rogers: Excuse me?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Dr. Abraham Erskine. [walks over and introduces himself to Steve] I represent the Strategic Scientific Reserve.\
Steve Rogers: Steve Rogers.\
[Dr. Erskine starts looking through Steve\'92s file]\
Steve Rogers: Where are you from?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Queens. 73rd Street and Utopia Parkway. Before that, Germany. This troubles you?\
Steve Rogers: [shakes his head] No.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [flipping through Steve\'92s file] Where are you from, Mr. Rogers? Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities.\
Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it\'92s not the exams I\'92m interested in. It\'92s the five tries. But you didn\'92t answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis?\
Steve Rogers: Is this a test?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes.\
Steve Rogers: I don\'92t wanna kill anyone. I don\'92t like bullies. I don\'92t care where they\'92re from.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? I can offer you a chance.\
[They exit the room]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Only a chance.\
Steve Rogers: I\'92ll take it.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. So where is the little guy from, actually?\
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [Dr. Erskine stamps Steve\'92s form and hands him back his file] Congratulations, soldier.\
[Steve opens up the file and sees that he\'92s been stamped as accepted]\
[In a HYDRA lab in a very mountainous region]\
Johann Schmidt: Are you ready, Dr. Zola?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: My machine requires the most delicate calibration. Forgive me if I seem overcautious.\
Johann Schmidt: And are you certain that those conductors of yours can withstand the energy surge long enough for a transference?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: With this artifact, I am certain of nothing. I fear it may not work at all.\
[Schmidt inserts the Tesseract carefully into the machine. Zola starts it up.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Twenty percent. Forty. Sixty. Stabilising at 70%.\
Johann Schmidt: [takes over the controls] I have not come all this way for safety, Doctor. [He turns the controls up to maximum and blue light flitters through the room.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is that?\
[after successfully collecting the power from the glowing Tesseract using Zola\'92s machine]\
Johann Schmidt: I must congratulate you, Arnim. Your designs do not disappoint. Though they may require some slight reinforcement.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: The exchange is stable. Amazing! The energy we have just collected could power my design, all my designs. This will change the war.\
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola, this will change the world.\
[At a US training camp. Steve stands in line with others.]\
Officer: [off-screen to other soldiers training] Ready, exercise!\
Peggy Carter: Recruits, attention! Gentlemen, I\'92m Agent Carter. I supervise all operations for this division.\
Gilmore Hodge: What\'92s with the accent, Queen Victoria? Thought I was signing up for the U.S. Army.\
Peggy Carter: What\'92s your name, soldier?\
Gilmore Hodge: Gilmore Hodge, your Majesty.\
Peggy Carter: Step forward, Hodge.\
[Hodge steps forward, smirking]\
Peggy Carter: Put your right foot forward.\
Gilmore Hodge: Mmm\'85 We gonna wrassle? Cause I got a few moves I know you\'92ll like.\
[suddenly Peggy punches him hard in the face]\
[Col.Phillips drives up]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter.\
Peggy Carter: Colonel Phillips.\
Col. Chester Phillips: I see you\'92re breaking in the candidates. That\'92s good! [to Hodge] Get your ass up out of that dirt and stand in that line at attention 'til somebody comes tells you what to do.\
Gilmore Hodge: [he gets back up] Yes, sir.\
Col. Chester Phillips: [addressing the new army recruits] General Patton has said that wars are fought with weapons but they are won by men. We are going to win this war because we have the best men\'85 [he sees Rogers and continues talking] And because they\'92re gonna get better. Much better. The Strategic Scientific Reserve is an Allied effort made up of the best minds in the free world. Our goal is to create the best army in history. But every army starts with one man. At the end of this week we will choose that man. He will be the first in a new breed of super-soldiers. [While Phillips talk we see scenes of Steve unpacking and training where he fails to keep up and gets bullied by the others.]\
Sergeant Duffy: Rogers! Get that rifle out of the mud!\
Col. Chester Phillips: And they, will personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of Hell.\
[then we see Steve and some other trainees running up to a waiting Peggy and a flagpole]\
Sergeant Duffy: Pick up the pace, ladies! Let\'92s go! Double time! Come on! Faster! Faster! Move! Move! [they arrive at the flag pole] Squad, halt! That flag means we\'92re only at the halfway point. First man to bring it to me gets a ride back with Agent Carter. Move, move!\
Soldiers: Come on! Get up there!\
Sergeant Duffy: [the soldier try to climb up the pole to no avail] If that\'92s all you got, this army\'92s in trouble! Get up there, Hodge! Come on! Get up there! Nobody\'92s got that flag in 17 years! Now fall back into line! Come on, fall in! Let\'92s go! Get back into formation! Rogers! I said fall in! [Steve pulls a pin out at the bottom of the pole causing it to fall over.]\
Steve Rogers: [as he gives the flag to Sergeant Duffy] Thank you, sir. [He climbs into the car and they drive away.]\
[The soldiers are doing push-ups.]\
Peggy Carter: Faster, ladies! Come on. My grandmother has more life in her, God rest her soul. Move it!\
Col. Chester Phillips: [walking besides Erskine] You\'92re not really thinking about picking Rogers, are you?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am more than just thinking about it. He is the clear choice.\
Col. Chester Phillips: When you brought a ninety-pound asthmatic onto my army base, I let it slide. I thought, what the hell? Maybe he\'92ll be useful to you, like a gerbil. I never thought you\'92d pick him. [referring to Steve]\
Peggy Carter: [as Phillips and Erskine arrive she commands the soldiers:] Up.\
Col. Chester Phillips: You stick a needle in that kids arm and it\'92s gonna go right through him. [watching Steve struggling whilst training with the other new recruits]\
Peggy Carter: Come on, girls.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Look at that. He\'92s making me cry.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I am looking for qualities beyond the physical.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Do you know how long it took to set up this project?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, I know.\
Col. Chester Phillips: All the groveling I had to do in front of Senator What\'92s-His-Name\'92s committees?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Brandt. Yes, I know. I am well aware of your efforts.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Then throw me a bone. Hodge passed every test we gave him. He\'92s big, he\'92s fast, he obeys orders. He\'92s a soldier.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: He\'92s a bully.\
Col. Chester Phillips: You don\'92t win wars with niceness, doctor. [he takes a hand grenade] You win war with guts. [he throws the grenade at where the new recruits are training] Grenade!\
[all the soldiers move away quickly but Steve jumps on top of it covering it with his body]\
Steve Rogers: Get away! Get back! [waits for the grenade to go off but nothing happens]\
Officer: It was a dummy grenade. All clear. Back in formation.\
[Steve looks at Phillips and Erskine]\
Steve Rogers: Is this is a test?\
[Erskine looks at Phillips as to confirm his point about choosing Steve]\
Col. Chester Phillips: He\'92s still skinny.\
[later that night, Steve sits on his bunk reading. Erskine knocks on the door.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: May I?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Can\'92t sleep?\
Steve Rogers: I got the jitters, I guess.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [laughs] Me, too.\
Steve Rogers: Can I ask you a question?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Just one? [he sits down facing Steve]\
Steve Rogers: Why me?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: I suppose that is the only question that matters. [He looks down at the bottle of schnapps he brought with him.] This is from Augsburg. My city. So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi\'92s invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the\'85 my people struggled. They\'85 they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the\'85 and the\'85 [he waves his hand] And he\'85 he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, "You." He says, "You will make us strong." Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of HYDRA, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he\'92s ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for occult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt, it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power hidden in the earth, left here by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist.\
[flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine\'92s formula and injects himself with it]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man.\
Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength, and knows compassion.\
Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [he pours 2 drinks] Whatever happens tomorrow, you must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are. Not a perfect soldier, but a good man.\
[Steve holds up his glass to toast]\
Steve Rogers: To the little guys.\
[just as Steve\'92s about to drink from his glass]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! No! Wait! Wait! What I am doing? No! You have a procedure tomorrow. No fluids.\
[he pours the contents of Steve\'92s glass into his own]\
Steve Rogers: All right. We\'92ll drink it after.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: No! I don\'92t have procedure tomorrow. Drink it after? Drink it now!\
[At the Hydra facility, in Schmidt\'92s lab.]\
Johann Schmidt: [he turns off the light] Is there something in particular you need? [An artist is painting Schmidt\'92s portrait in oil.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: I understand you found him.\
Johann Schmidt: See for yourself. [Zola steps over to the table to find several survaillance photos of Dr. Erskine.] You disapprove.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: I just don\'92t see why you need concern yourself. I can\'92t imagine he will succeed. [looking nervously at Schmidt] Again.\
Johann Schmidt: His serum is the Allies\'92 only defence against this power we now possess. If we take it away from them, then our victory is assured.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Shall I give the order?\
Johann Schmidt: It has been given.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Good. [he turns to go]\
Johann Schmidt: Dr. Zola. [he turns on the lights] What do you think?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: A masterpiece. [the artist looks relieved with Zola\'92s assessment]\
[Steve and Peggy whilst driving through Brooklyn]\
Steve Rogers: I know this neighborhood. I got beat up in that alley. And that parking lot. And behind that diner.\
Peggy Carter: Did you have something against running away?\
Steve Rogers: You start running they\'92ll never let you stop. You stand up, push back. Can\'92t say no forever, right?\
Peggy Carter: I know a little of what that\'92s like. To have every door shut in your face.\
Steve Rogers: I guess I just don\'92t why you\'92d wanna join the army if you\'92re a beautiful dame. Or a beautiful\'85 a woman. An agent, not a dame! You are beautiful, but\'85\
Peggy Carter: You have no idea how to talk to a woman, do you?\
Steve Rogers: This is the longers conversation I\'92ve had with one. Women aren\'92t exactly lining up to dance with a guy they might step on.\
Peggy Carter: You must have danced?\
Steve Rogers: Well, asking a woman to dance always seems so terrifying. And the past few years just didn\'92t seem to matter that much. Figured I\'92d wait.\
Peggy Carter: For what?\
Steve Rogers: The right partner.\
[They pull up by an antiques shop and get out of the car.]\
Peggy Carter: This way.\
Steve Rogers: What are we doing here?\
Peggy Carter: Follow me. [They go inside.]\
Antique Store Owner: Wonderful weather this morning isn\'92t it?\
Peggy Carter: Yes, but I always carry an umbrella.\
[Peggy leads Steve into the hidden lab to Dr. Erskine and his team in a big circular room filled with machinery and a pod in the middle.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good morning. [he shakes Steve\'92s hand and sombody takes a photograph] Please, not now. [The photographer walks away, Steve looks at the pod] Are you ready? [Steve nods.] Good. Take off your shirt, your tie and your hat.\
[In the adjacent observation chamber filled with officials.]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, glad you could make it.\
Senator Brandt: Why exactly am I in Brooklyn?\
Col. Chester Phillips: We needed access to the city\'92s power grid. Of course, if you\'92d given me the generators I requisitioned\'85\
Senator Brandt: A lot of people are asking for funds, Colonel. [referring to his company] Oh, this is\'85\
Heinz Kruger: Fred Clemson, State Department. [He shakes Phillips\'92 hand] If this project of yours comes through, we\'92d like to see it used for something other than headlines.\
Senator Brandt: [looing down into the chamber at Steve] Jesus. Somebody get that kid a sandwich.\
[In the chamber Steve has climbed into the pod and lain down.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Comfortable?\
Steve Rogers: It\'92s a little big. You save me any of that schnapps?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Not as much as I should have. Sorry. Next time. Mr. Stark, how are your levels?\
Howard Stark: Levels at 100%.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good.\
Howard Stark: We may dim half the lights in Brooklyn, but we are ready as we\'92ll ever be.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Agent Carter? Don\'92t you think you would be more comfortable in the booth?\
Peggy Carter: Oh, yes. Of course. Sorry.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Good. [He takes a microphone and taps it.] Do you hear me? is this on? [to the small group gathered to watch Steve being prepared to become a super-solider] Ladies and gentlemen, today we take not another step towards annihilation, but the first step on the path to peace. We begin with a series of micro injections into the subjects major muscle groups. The serum infusion will cause immediate cellular change. And then to stimulate growth, the subject will be saturated with Vita-Rays.\
Steve Rogers: [after preliminary injection] That wasn\'92t so bad.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: That was penicillin. [to the others] Serum infusion beginning in five, four, three, two, one. [The serum is injected into Steve] Now, Mr. Stark. [Stark lowers a leaver, the pod moves upright and encloses Steve inside.] [knocking on the capsule that they\'92ve locked Steven in for the procedure to change him] Steven, can you hear me?\
Steve Rogers: It\'92s probably too late to go to the bathroom, right?\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: [turns to Stark] We will proceed.\
Howard Stark: [manages the controls] That\'92s ten percent. Twenty percent. Thirty. That\'92s 40 %.\
SSR Doctor: Vital signs are normal.\
Howard Stark: That\'92s 50 %. Sixty. Seventy.\
[as Steve is screaming in pain as he is receiving the vita rays]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven!\
Peggy Carter: Shut it down.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven! [he knocks on the pod]\
Peggy Carter: Shut it down!\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Kill the reactor, Mr. Stark! Turn it off! Kill it! Kill the reactor!\
Steve Rogers: No! Don\'92t! I can do this!\
Howard Stark: Eighty. Ninety. That\'92s 100 %. [Everything overloads until the reactor closes itself down.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Mr. Stark? [Stark opens the pod]\
[after being transformed into a super-soldier]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Steven. Steven.\
Col. Chester Phillips: The son of a bitch did it. [as everyone poors out of the observation chamber Kruger leaves a small, metal object like a cigarett case behind.]\
Steve Rogers: [As he stumbles out of the pod supported by Stark and Erskine] I did it.\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah, yeah. I think we did it.\
Howard Stark: We actually did it.\
Peggy Carter: How do you feel?\
Steve Rogers: Taller.\
Peggy Carter: You look taller.\
Col. Chester Phillips: How do you like Brooklyn now, Senator?\
Senator Brandt: I can think of some folks in Berlin who are about to get very nervous. Congratulations, Doctor. [He shakes hands with Erskine.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Thank you, sir.\
[Kruger detonates the bomb in the observation room and uses the confusion to steal the last vial of the serum.]\
Dr. Abraham Erskine: Stop him! [Kruger shoots him and flees with Peggy chasing after him]\
[Steve kneels beside Erskine who points at Steve\'92s chest and dies.]\
[Kruger shoots his way to a get-away-car but soon after he drives away, Peggy shoots the driver and the car crashes into a taxi so Kruger changes cars.]\
Taxi Driver: What are you doing? Buddy, are you all right? Hey, this guy\'92s been shot!\
[Kruger drives off in the taxi, straight towards Peggy. She shoots at him but he just ducks and keeps going. Steve shoves her out of the way.]\
Peggy Carter. I had him!\
Steve Rogers: Sorry! [he runs after the cab] [While chasing the car he loses control over his new power and crashes into a bridalwear store.] I\'92m sorry. [he runs out into a street full of cars] Whoa, whoa, whoa!\
[Steve catches up to Kruger\'92s car a the pier and causes him to lose control. Kruger gets out of the car and takes a young boy hostage.]\
Mother: No! No! Not my son!\
Young Boy: Stop it!\
Mother: Don\'92t hurt him!\
Heinz Kruger: Get back! [Kruger with the boy dangling in his arms runs away.]\
Young Boy: Let me go!\
Mother: Let go of my son! Don\'92t hurt him!\
Steve Rogers: [as Kruger points a gun at the boy\'92s head.] Wait, don\'92t! Don\'92t! [Kruger points the gun at Steve and pulls the trigger, but the gun is empty. So instead he throws the boy into the water.] No! Don\'92t! [Kruger runs, Steve looks down at the boy.]\
Young Boy: Go get him! I can swim!\
[Kruger tries to escape in a submarine, but Steve jumps into the water, breaks the window an pulls Kruger out back onto dry land. As they struggle further the vial breaks.]\
Steve Rogers: Who the hell are you?\
Heinz Kruger: The first of many. Cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail HYDRA! [he pops a fake tooth loose and swallows it, he starts to foam at the mouth and then die]\
[At HYDRA HQ]\
Hutter: The F\'fchrer is not accustomed to being ignored, Herr Schmidt. He funds your research because you promised him weapons.\
Schneider: You serve at his pleasure. He gave you this facility as a reward for your injuries.\
Johann Schmidt: Reward? Call it what it is. Exile. I no longer reflect his image of Aryan perfection.\
Roeder: You think this is about appearances? Your HYDRA division has failed to deliver so much as a rifle in over a year. And we had learned through local intelligence you had mounted a full-scale incursion into Norway.\
Schneider: The F\'fchrer feels\'85 How does he put it? "The Red Skull has been indulged long enough!"\
Johann Schmidt: Gentlemen, you have come to see the results of our work. Let me show you. [They enter the lab.] Hitler speaks of a thousand-year Reich, but he cannot feed his army for a month. His troops spill their blood across every field in Europe. But still he is no closer to achieving his goals.\
Roeder: And I suppose you still aim to end this war through magic?\
Johann Schmidt: Science. But I understand your confusion. Great power has always baffled primitive men. HYDRA is assembling an arsenal to destroy my enemies in one stroke. Where ever they are, regardless of how many forces they possess. All in a matter of hours.\
Roeder: Your enemies?\
Johann Schmidt: My weapons contain enough destructive power to decimate every hostile capital on earth. Quite simply, gentlemen, I have harnessed the power of the Gods.\
Schneider: Thank you, Schmidt.\
Johann Schmidt: For what?\
Schneider: For making it clear how obviously mad you are.\
Hutter: [studying a map lying in Schmidt\'92s labor.] Berlin is on this map!\
Johann Schmidt: So it is.\
Hutter: You will be punished for your insolence! You will be brought before the F\'fchrer himself! [Schmidt kills them all with his new Tesseract-powered canon.]\
Roeder: [screams before he\'92s desintegrated] Schmidt!!!\
Johann Schmidt: My apolpgies, Doctor, but we both knew HYDRA could grow no further in Hitler\'92s shadow. Hail HYDRA.\
HYDRA technicians: Hail HYDRA! [raising both arms to salute]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: [when Schmidt turns to him] Hail HYDRA!\
[At the SSR compound.]\
Steve Rogers: [referring to the amount of blood samples taken from him] Think you got enough?\
Peggy Carter: Any hope of reproducing a program is locked in your genetic code. But without Dr. Erskine, it could take years.\
Steve Rogers: He deserved more than this.\
Peggy Carter: If it could only work once, he\'92d be proud it was you.\
[SSR tech lab with the Hydra submarine]\
Senator Brandt: Colonel Phillips, my committee is demanding answers.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Great. Why don\'92t we start with how a German spy got a ride to my secret installation in your car? [to Stark who is working on the submarine] What have we got here?\
Howard Stark: Speaking modestly, I\'92m the best mechanical engineer in this country. But I don\'92t know what\'92s inside this thing or how it works. We\'92re not even close to this technology.\
Senator Brandt: Then who is?\
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA. I\'92m sure you\'92ve been reading our briefings.\
Senator Brandt: I\'92m on a number of committees, Colonel.\
Peggy Carter: HYDRA is the Nazi deep science division. It\'92s led by Johann Schmidt. But he has much bigger ambitions.\
Col. Chester Phillips: HYDRA\'92s practically a cult. They worship Schmidt, they think he\'92s invincible.\
Senator Brandt: So what are you gonna do about it?\
Col. Chester Phillips: Spoke to the president this morning. As of today the SSR is being retasked.\
Peggy Carter: Colonel?\
Col. Chester Phillips: We are taking the fight to HYDRA. Pack your bags Agent Carter. You too, Stark. You\'92re flying to London tonight.\
Steve Rogers: Sir, if you\'92re going after Schmidt, I want in.\
Col. Chester Phillips: You\'92re an experiment. You\'92re going to Alamogordo.\
Steve Rogers: The serum worked.\
Col. Chester Phillips: I asked for an army and all I got was you. You are not enough.\
Senator Brandt: [to Steve] With all due respect to the Colonel, I think we may be missing the point. I\'92ve seen you in action, Steve. More importantly, the country\'92s seen it. [to his aide] Paper.[the aide shows them the news paper (\'91The New York Examiner\'92 Vol. XCVII No. 33.634, Wednesday, June 23, 1943), headlines: "Nazis in New York - mystery man saves child"] The enlistment lines have been around the block since your picture hit the newsstands. You don\'92t take a soldier, a symbol like that, and hide him in a lab. Son, do you want to serve your country on the most important battlefield of the war?\
Steve Rogers: Sir, that\'92s all I want.\
Senator Brandt: Then, congratulations. You just got promoted.\
Steve Rogers: [backstage as Steve is getting dressed in super-hero costume] I don\'92t know if I can do this.\
Brandt\'92s Aide: Nothing to it. Sell off a few bonds, bonds buy bullets, bullets kills Nazi\'92s. Bing bang boom. You\'92re an American hero.\
Steve Rogers: It\'92s just not how I pictured getting there.\
Brandt\'92s Aide: The senator\'92s got a lot of pull up on the hill. You play ball with us, you\'92ll be leading your own platoon in no time. Take the shield. [as Steve puts on his head mask he pushes Steve onto the stage]\
USO Singer: Who\'92s strong and brave, here to save the American way?\
Steve Rogers: [As women start to sing and dance in the background Steve reads:] Not all of us can storm a beach or drive a tank. But there\'92s still a way all of us can fight.\
USO Singer: Who vows to fight like a man, for what\'92s right, night and day?\
Steve Rogers: Series E Defence Bonds. Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy\'92s gun.\
USO Singer: Who will campaign door-to-door for America? Carry the flag shore to shore for America? From Hoboken to Spokane, the star-spangeld man with a plan.\
[Steve leads a group of men dressed as soldiers in front of a moving image.]\
Director: Cut. Guys, don\'92t look ath the camera.\
[back to a scene where he\'92s on tour.]\
USO Singer: We can\'92t ignore there\'92s a threat and a war we must win.\
Steve Rogers: Each one you buy is a bullet in the barrel of your best guy\'92s gun.\
USO Singer: Who\'92ll hang a noose on the goose-stepping goons from Berlin? Who will redeem, heed the call for America? Who\'92ll rise or fall, give his all for America? Who\'92s here to prove that we can? The star-spangled man with a plan.\
Steve Rogers: We all know this is about trying to win the war. We can\'92t do that without bullets and bandages, tanks and tents. That\'92s where you come in. Every bond you buy will help protect someone you love. [A men dressed as hitler sneaks up on him on the stage.]\
Kids in USO Audience: Turn around! He\'92s right behind you!\
Steve Rogers: Keep our boys armed and ready, and the Germans will think twice about trying to get the drop on us. [The man attacs him and gets fake-punched.]\
USO Singer: Stalwart and steady and true, forcefull and ready to defend, the red, white, and blue. Who\'92ll give the Axis the sack and is smart as a fox? Far as an eagle will soar. Who\'92s making Adolf afraid to step out of his box? He knows what we\'92re fighting for. Who waked the giant that napped in America? We know it\'92s no one but Captain America. Who\'92ll finish what they began? Who\'92ll kick the Krauts to Japan? The star-spangled man with a aplan! [Scenes show how Captain America goes on tour around America, appears in comics and films, how he\'92s approached by multiple fans, and generally becomes more liked and famous.]\
[Italy, November 1943, 5 miles from the front. Steve addresses a crowd of soldiers dressed in his super-hero costume]\
Steve Rogers: How many of you ready to help me sock old Adolf on the jaw? [silence from the crowd of soldiers] Okay. Uh\'85 I need a volunteer.\
Army Heckler#1: I already volunteered! How do you think I got here? [the crowd of soldiers laugh] Bring back the girls! [there\'92s a cheer from the soldiers]\
Steve Rogers: I think they only know the one song. But um\'85let me\'85I\'92ll\'85I\'92ll see what I can do.\
Army Heckler#1: You do that, sweetheart.\
Army Heckler#2: Nice boots, Tinker Bell! [the crowd of soldiers laugh]\
Steve Rogers: Come on, guys. We\'92re all on the same team here.\
Army Heckler#3: Hey, Captain! Sign this! [he stands turns and pulls his pants down and the crowd starts to throw things at Steve.]\
Army Heckler#4: Bring back the girls! [The women run on stage and the crowd cheers.]\
Brandt\'92s Aide: [backstage to Steve] Don\'92t worry, pal. They\'92ll warm up to you. Don\'92t worry.\
[Later, Steve sits on the edge of the stage sketching as rain pours down in the background.]\
Peggy Carter: Hello, Steve.\
Steve Rogers: [He turns and looks up at Peggy.] Hi.\
Peggy Carter: Hi.\
Steve Rogers: What are you doin\'92 here?\
Peggy Carter: Officially I\'92m not here at all. That was quite a performance.\
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Uh\'85 I had to improvise a little bit. Crowds I\'92m used to are usually more uh\'85 twelve.\
Peggy Carter: I understand you\'92re "America\'92s New Hope"?\
Steve Rogers: Bond sales take a ten percent bump in every state I visit.\
Peggy Carter: Is that Senator Brandt I hear?\
Steve Rogers: At least he\'92s got me doin\'92 this. Phillips would have had be stuck in lab.\
Peggy Carter: And these are your only two options? A lab rat or a dancing monkey? You were meant for more than this, you know? [Steve goes to respond but hesitates] What?\
Steve Rogers: You know for the longest time I dreamed about coming overseas and being on the front lines. Serving my country. I finally get everything I wanted, and I\'92m wearing tights. [Honking in the background as an ambulance arrives with wounded soldiers. Steve and Peggy turn around to watch.] They look like they\'92ve been through hell.\
Peggy Carter: These men more than most. Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two hundred men went up against him and less than fifty returned. Your audience contained what was left of the one-oh-seventh. The rest were killed or captured.\
Steve Rogers: The one-oh-seventh?\
Peggy Carter: What?\
Steve Rogers: Come on! [They run to a tent.] Colonel Phillips.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, if it isn\'92t the Star-Spangled Man With A Plan. And what is your plan today?\
Steve Rogers: I need the casualty list from Azzano.\
Col. Chester Phillips: You don\'92t get to give me orders, son.\
Steve Rogers: I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh.\
Col. Chester Phillips: [pointing to Peggy] You and I are gonna have a conversation later that you won\'92t enjoy.\
Steve Rogers: Please tell me if he\'92s alive, sir. B-A-R\'85\
Col. Chester Phillips: I can spell. [referring to Barnes] I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I\'92m sorry.\
Steve Rogers: What about the others? Are you planning a rescue mission?\
Col. Chester Phillips: Yeah! It\'92s called winning the war.\
Steve Rogers: But if you know where they are, why not at least\'85?\
Col. Chester Phillips: They\'92re thirty miles behind the lines. Through the most heavily fortified territory in Europe. We\'92d lose more men than we\'92d save. But I don\'92t expect you to understand that, because you\'92re a chorus girl.\
Steve Rogers: I think I understand just fine.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Well then understand it somewhere else. If I read the posters correctly, you got some place to be in thirty minutes. [as Phillips walks away Steve looks at the military map which shows where the men are]\
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I do.\
Col. Chester Phillips: [To Peggy] If you have something to say, right now is the perfect time to keep it to yourself.\
Peggy Carter: [She follows Steve to his tent where he starts to change and pack some things.] What do you plan to do? Walk to Austria?\
Steve Rogers: If that\'92s what it takes.\
Peggy Carter: You heard the Colonel, your friend is most likely dead.\
Steve Rogers: You don\'92t know that.\
Peggy Carter: Even so, he\'92s devising a strategy. If he detects\'85\
Steve Rogers: By the time he\'92s done that, it could be too late! [He walks out to a jeep.] You told me you thought I was meant for more than this. Did you mean that?\
Peggy Carter: Every word.\
Steve Rogers: Then you gotta let me go. [He gets in the jeep.]\
Peggy Carter: I can do more than that.\
[backstage with the USO girls]\
Brandt\'92s Aide: On stage, girls. Five minutes!\
USO girl: Where\'92s my helmet?\
Brandt\'92s Aide: Has anyone seen Rogers?\
[Peggy and Steve in a plane piloted by Stark.]\
Peggy Carter: The HYDRA camp is in Krausberg, tucked between these two mountain ranges. It\'92s a factory of some kind.\
Howard Stark: We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep.\
Steve Rogers: Just get me as close as you can. [referring to Stark and Peggy helping him] You know, you two are gonna be in a lot of trouble at the lab.\
Peggy Carter: And you won\'92t?\
Steve Rogers: Where I\'92m goin\'92, if anybody yells at me I can just shoot \'91em.\
Peggy Carter: They will undoubtedly shoot back.\
Steve Rogers: Well, let\'92s hope it\'92s good for somethin\'92. [He knocks at his shield.]\
Howard Stark: Agent Carter, if we\'92re not in too much of a hurry I thought we could stop off in Lucerne for a late night fondue. [Peggy looks awkwardly at Steve who\'92s getting ready to parachute.]\
Peggy Carter: Stark is the best civilian pilot I\'92ve ever seen. He\'92s mad enough to brave this airspace, we\'92re lucky to have him.\
Steve Rogers: So are you two\'85? Do you\'85? Fondue?\
Peggy Carter: [She ignores Steve\'92s akward and confused rambling.] This is your transponder. Activate it when you\'92re ready and the signal will lead us straight to you.\
Steve Rogers: Are you sure this thing works?\
Howard Stark: It\'92s been tested more than you, pal. [as their plane is being attacked Steve goes towards the opened door of the plane to jump]\
Peggy Carter: Get back here! We\'92re taking you all the way in.\
Steve Rogers: As soon as I\'92m free, you turn this thing around and get the hell outta here!\
Peggy Carter: You can\'92t give me orders!\
Steve Rogers: The hell I can\'92t! I\'92m a Captain! [he looks at her and then jumps out of the plane]\
[In the Hydra factory located in Italy, Schmidt and Zola walk side by side through the workspace.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: As you can see, production of the Valkyrie is progressing on schedule, even with components of this size.\
Johann Schmidt: Increase the output by 60 % and see to it our other facilities do the same.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the prisoners, I\'92m not sure they have the strength.\
Johann Schmidt: Then use up what strength they have left, Doctor. There are always more workers.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: [To someone approaching him with a clip board] Not now!\
[At the cells where prisoners are lead into. One of the guards knocks the hat from Dumdum Dugan\'92s head.]\
Dum Dum Dugan: You know, Fritz, one of these days, I\'92m gonna have a stick of my own.\
[Steve runs through the dark woods until he finds a road where trucks a driving by. He gets into the back of one of them and finds himself face to face with two Hydra guards.]\
Steve Rogers: Fellas.\
HYDRA guards: Ah!\
[After Steve snuck into the HYDRA factory and stole a blue shining cartridge, he finds some of the captured American soldiers]\
Gabe Jones: Who are you supposed to be?\
Steve Rogers: I\'92m\'85 Captain America.\
James Montgomery Falsworth: I beg your pardon?\
Dum Dum Dugan: [After Steve has unlocked their cells and prisoner start pooring out, he says to a Jim Morita, a Japanese looking man] What, are we taking everybody?\
Jim Morita: [takes out his dog tags] I\'92m from Fresno, Ace.\
Steve Rogers: Is there anybody else? I\'92m looking for a Sergeant James Barnes.\
James Montgomery Falsworth: There\'92s an isolation ward in the factory, but no one\'92s ever come back from it.\
Steve Rogers: All right. The tree line is northwest, 80 yards past the gate. Get out fast and give \'91em hell. I\'92ll meet you guys in the clearing with anybody else I find.\
Gabe Jones: Wait! You know what you\'92re doin\'92?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah. I\'92ve knocked out Adolf Hitler over two hundred times.\
[The prisoners escape into the compound, overpowering the guards with their sheer numbers. Dernier picks up one of the new Tesseract-powered HYDRA guns.]\
Jim Morita: You know how to use that thing? [Dernier shoots, blowing up a wall] Okay.\
[HYDRA factory command center]\
Johann Schmidt: [stares at a surveillance screen] What is happening? [He presses an alarm.]\
[back to the prisoners in the compound, Dum Dum and Jones overtake a small tank.]\
Dum Dum Dugan: Hey. Not exactly a Buick.\
Gabe Jones: [points at the controls] That one. Z\'fcndung. (Ignition.)\
Dum Dum Dugan: Z\'fcndung?\
James Montgomery Falsworth: [jumps into the tank] Get this thing going, Dugan!\
Dum Dum Dugan: [to Jones] I didn\'92t know you spoke German.\
Gabe Jones: Three semesters at Howards, switched to French, girls much cuter.\
Dum Dum Dugan: Didn\'92t ask for the resume.\
[In the HYDRA control room Schmidt watches Steve on the monitors and decides to activate the self destruct sequence which are counting down from 7 minutes.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: No, no! What are you doing?\
Johann Schmidt: Our forces are outmatched. [Zola looks at the screens, then runs out of the room.]\
[Dernier and Morita running through the compound with other prisoners.]\
Jim Morita: Keep moving! Grab those grenades!\
[Schmidt secures the Tesseract while Zola packs the blueprints of his design. Steve sees him in the corridor but hesitates to chase him when he hears someone.]\
James Barnes: Sergeant. 32557\'85\
Steve Rogers: [he finds Barnes strapped to a chair in one of Schmidt\'92s testing labs] Bucky? Oh, my God. [he unstraps him from the chair]\
James Barnes: Is that\'85\
Steve Rogers: It\'92s me. It\'92s Steve.\
James Barnes: Steve?\
Steve Rogers: Come on.\
James Barnes: Steve.\
Steve Rogers: I thought you were dead.\
James Barnes: I thought you were smaller. [referring to Steve\'92s change of appearance]\
Steve Rogers: Come on.\
James Barnes: What happened to you?\
Steve Rogers: I joined the Army. [referring to Steve\'92s undergoing change to a super-soldier]\
James Barnes: Did it hurt?\
Steve Rogers: A little.\
James Barnes: Is it permanent?\
Steve Rogers: So far.\
[They flee through the exploding factory until they meet Schmidt and Zola.]\
Johann Schmidt: Captain America! How exciting! I\'92m a great fan of your films. So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive. [Steve punches Schmidt hard in the face]\
Steve Rogers: You\'92ve got no idea.\
Johann Schmidt: Haven\'92t I? [He goes to hit Steve but Steve protects himself with his shield. As they fight, Zola pulls a leaver and the catwalk they are standing on retracts to either side seperating them.] No matter what lies Erskine told you, you see I was his greatest success! [he peels off the skin on his face to reveal that he is the Red Skull]\
James Barnes: [to Steve referring to Schmidt\'92s skinless face] You don\'92t have one of those, do you?\
Johann Schmidt: You are deluded, Captain. You pretend to be a simple soldier, but in reality you are just afraid to admit that we have left humanity behind. Unlike you, I embrace it proudly. Without fear!\
Steve Rogers: Then how come you\'92re running? [Schmidt and Zola continue their escape and so do Steve and Bucky.] Come on, let\'92s go. Up.\
[Schmidt and Zola in an elevator.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Sir? Are we going to the roof? [The doors open to reveal a one-man-plane] What about me? Where will I sit?\
Johann Schmidt: [gives Zola his car keys] Not a scratch, Doctor. Not a scratch. [We see Schmidt and Zola escaping.]\
[Steve and Bucky on a catwalk, beneath them everything is on fire, they have to reach the other side of the room over a thin gantry.]\
Steve Rogers: Let\'92s go. One at a time. [Bucky reaches the other side but the gantry collapses behind him.]\
James Barnes: Gotta be a rope or something!\
Steve Rogers: Just go! Get out of here!\
James Barnes: No! Not without you! [Steve jumps over the chasm.]\
[In the Amry camp Phillips is dictating a letter to a Corporal.]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Senator Brandt, I regret to report that Captain Steven G. Rogers went missing behind enemy lines on the third. Aerial reconnaissance has proven unfruitful. As a result, I must declare Captain Rogers killed in action. Period.\
Peggy Carter: The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Go get a cup of coffee, Corporal.\
Corporal: Yes, sir. [he leaves]\
Col. Chester Phillips: I can\'92t touch Stark. He\'92s rich and he\'92s the Army\'92s number one weapons contractor. You are neither one.\
Peggy Carter: With respect, sir, I don\'92t regret my actions. And I don\'92t think Captain Rogers did either.\
Col. Chester Phillips: What makes you think I give a damn about your opinions. I took a chance with you, Agent Carter. And now America\'92s golden boy and a lot of other good men are dead, cause you had a crush.\
Peggy Carter: It wasn\'92t that. I had faith.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Well, I hope that\'92s a big comfort to you when they shut this division down. [Soldier start running and talking exitedly in the background.] What the hell\'92s going on out there? [They follow the crowd to the edge of the camp where Steve\'92S arriving with the freed prisoners.]\
Man#1: Look who it is! [everyone cheers]\
Steve Rogers: [salutes to Phillips] Some of theres men need medical attention.\
Man#2: Medic, we got wounded.\
Medic. Right over here.\
Steve Rogers: I\'92d like to surrender myself for disciplinary action.\
Col. Chester Phillips: That won\'92t be necessary.\
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir.\
Col. Chester Phillips: [he turns and walks away from Steve and he notices Peggy] Faith, huh?\
Peggy Carter: [to Steve] You\'92re late.\
Steve Rogers: [holding up the broken transponder] Couldn\'92t call my ride.\
James Barnes: [to the men] Hey! Let\'92s hear it for Captain America. [more cheering]\
Senator Brandt: [somewhere in America talking to a small crowd] I am honoured to present this medal for valour to my personal friend, Captain America! [he turns around but no one is there.] Captain America! [still nothing] Captain, that\'92s your cue! [his aide comes out, whispering something to him]\
General: [sitting in the crowd talking quietly to the man next to him] I thought he\'92d be taller. [misunderstanding the aide to be Captain America]\
[Allied HQ in London]\
Steve Rogers: The fifth one was here in Poland, right near the Baltic. [he marks it on a map] And the sixth one was\'85 about here, 30, 40 miles west of the Maginot Line. [a soldier takes the map away] I just got a quick look.\
Peggy Carter: Well, nobody\'92s perfect. [they walk over to Phillips and another map]\
Steve Rogers: These are the weapon factories we know about. Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn\'92t on this map.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Agent Carter, coordinate with MI6. I want every Allied eyeball looking for that main Hydra base.\
Peggy Carter: What about us?\
Col. Chester Phillips: We are gonna set a fire under Johann Schmidt\'92s ass. What do you say, Rogers? It\'92s your map, you think you can wipe Hydra off of it?\
Steve Rogers: Yes, sir. I\'92ll need a team.\
Col. Chester Phillips: We\'92re already putting together the best men.\
Steve Rogers: With all due respect, sir. So am I.\
[in a bar]\
Dum Dum Dugan: So, let\'92s get this straight.\
Gabe Jones: We barely got out of there alive, and you want us to go back?\
Steve Rogers: Pretty much.\
James Montgomery Falsworth: Sounds rather fun, actually.\
Jim Morita: [belches] I\'92m in.\
Gabe Jones: [Dernier and Gabe speaking French, Dernier laughs, they shake hands] We\'92re in.\
Dum Dum Dugan: Hell, I\'92ll always fight. But you got to do one thing for me.\
Steve Rogers: What\'92s that?\
Dum Dum Dugan: Open a tab.\
Jim Morita: Well, that was easy.\
Steve Rogers: [Steve goes over to the bar.] Another round.\
Barkeeper: Where are they putting all this stuff?\
James Barnes: [Steve joins Bucky at the barcounter. In the background everyone's singing "There's a Tavern in Town"[1]] See? I told you. They\'92re all idiots.\
Steve Rogers: How about you? You ready to follow Captain America into the jaws of death?\
James Barnes: Hell, no. That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I\'92m following him. But you\'92re keeping the outfit, right?\
Steve Rogers: You know what? It\'92s kind of growing on me.\
Peggy Carter: [The singing in the bar stops as Peggy in a tight fitting, deep-red dress walks in.] Captain.\
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter.\
James Barnes: Ma\'92am.\
Peggy Carter: Howard has some equipment for you to try. Tomorrow morning?\
Steve Rogers: Sounds good.\
Peggy Carter: I see you top squad is prepping for duty.\
James Barnes: You don\'92t like music?\
Peggy Carter: I do, actually. I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.\
James Barnes: Then what are we waiting for?\
Peggy Carter. The right partner. 0800, Captain.\
Steve Rogers: Yes, ma\'92m. I\'92ll be there.\
James Barnes: [referring to the rejection he got from Peggy about going dancing with him] I\'92m invisible. I\'92m\'85I\'92m turning into you. It\'92s like some horrible dream.\
Steve Rogers: Don\'92t take it so hard. Maybe she\'92s got a friend. [whilst waiting to see Stark]\
Howard Stark: [Morning, by a glass chamber, Stark examines the Hydra cartridge] Emission signature is unusual. Alpha and beta ray neutral. Though I doubt Rogers picked up on that. Seems harmless enough. Hard to see what all the fuss is about. [He removes a glowing pellet. The blast sends Stark and his engineer flying across the room.] Write that down.\
[Somewhere else in the building]\
Steve Rogers: [to Private Lorraine] Excuse me. I\'92m looking for Mr. Stark.\
Pvt. Lorraine: He\'92s in with Colonel Phillips. Of course you\'92re welcome to wait. [Steve perches on the edge of a desk to wait] I read about what you did. [she holds up the newspaper showing his rescue mission]\
Steve Rogers: Oh! The\'85yeah! Well, that\'92s you know? Just doin\'92 what needed to be done.\
Pvt. Lorraine: Sounded like more than that. You saved nearly four hundred men.\
Steve Rogers: Really, it\'92s not a big deal.\
Pvt. Lorraine: Tell that to their wives. [Steve gets nervous as she walks up to him]\
Steve Rogers: Uh\'85I don\'92t think they were all married.\
Pvt. Lorraine: You\'92re a hero.\
Steve Rogers: Well, that\'85you know? That\'85that depends on the definition of it really. [she grabs hold of his tie]\
Pvt. Lorraine: The women of America, they owe you their thanks. And uh\'85seeing as they\'92re not here. [drags him to the corner of the office and kisses him]\
Peggy Carter: [she walks in] Captain! [Steve and Pvt. Lorraine separate] We\'92re ready for you. If you\'92re not otherwise occupied. [annoyed, she turns and walks ahead]\
Steve Rogers: Agent Carter, wait.\
Peggy Carter: Looks like finding a partner wasn\'92t that hard after all.\
Steve Rogers: Peggy, that\'92s not what you thought it was.\
Peggy Carter: I don\'92t think anything, Captain. Not one thing. You always wanted to be soldier and now you are. Just like all the rest.\
Steve Rogers: Well, what about you and Stark? How do I know you two haven\'92t been\'85 fonduing?\
Peggy Carter: [she turns to look at him] You still don\'92t know a bloody thing about women!\
[In Stark\'92s lab]\
Howard Stark: Fondue is just cheese and bread, my friend.\
Steve Rogers: Really? I didn\'92t think\'85\
Howard Stark: Nor should you, pal. The moment you think you know what\'92s goin\'92 on in a woman\'92s head, it\'92s the moment your goose is well and truly cooked. Me, I concentrate on work. Which at the moment is about making sure you and your men do not get killed. Carbon polymer. [referring to a piece of cloth lying on the table] Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although Hydra\'92s not going to attack you with a pocket knife. [referring to Steve\'92s Captain America shield] I hear you\'92re uh\'85 kinda attached?\
Steve Rogers: It\'92s handier than you might think.\
Howard Stark: I took the liberty of coming up with some options. [shows him a few shields] This one\'92s fun. She\'92s been fitted with electrical relays. It\'92ll allow you to\'85\
Steve Rogers: What about this one? [he picks up a round silver looking shield]\
Howard Stark: No! No! That\'92s just a prototype.\
Steve Rogers: What\'92s it made of?\
Howard Stark: Vibranium. It\'92s stronger than steel and a third of the weight. It\'92s completely vibration absorbent.\
Steve Rogers: How come it\'92s not a standard issue?\
Howard Stark: That\'92s the rarest metal on earth. What you\'92re holding there? That\'92s all we\'92ve got.\
Peggy Carter: [as Steve is checking out the shield made out of Vibranium] You quite finished, Mr. Stark? I\'92m sure the Captain has some unfinished business.\
Steve Rogers: [holds up the Vibranium shield against him] What do you think? [Peggy picks up gun and shoots it at Steve as he quickly holds up the shield to protect himself]\
Peggy Carter: Yes. I think it works. [she puts the gun down and walks out of the lab, Steve and Howard looking at her stunned]\
Steve Rogers: I had some ideas about the uniform. [gives Stark a piece of paper]\
Howard Stark: [takes it] Whatever you want, pal.\
[Montage of Captain America and his Howling Commandos fighting Hydra.]\
[At the site of a destroyed Hydra base]\
Johann Schmidt: You are failing! We are close to an offensive network that will shake the planet. And yet we are continually delayed, because you cannot outwit a simpleton with a shield!\
Dr. Arnim Zola: This is hardly my area of expertise. I\'85I merely develop the weapons. I\'85I cannot fire them.\
Johann Schmidt: Finish your mission, Doctor. Before the American finishes his.\
Guard: [two guards arrive with the facility manager] Sir!\
Facility Manager: I\'92m sorry, Herr Schmidt. We fought to the last man.\
Johann Schmidt: Evidently not. [kills him]\
James Barnes: [On a snow covered mountain the Howling Commandos prepare to zipline onto the train.] Remember when I made you ride the Cyclone at Coney Island?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah, I and I threw up?\
James Barnes: This isn\'92t payback, is it?\
Steve Rogers: Now why would I do that?\
Gabe Jones: We were right. Dr. Zola\'92s on the train. Hydra dispatcher gave him permission to open up the throttle. Wherever he\'92s going, they must need him bad.\
James Montgomery Falsworth: Let\'92s get going, because they\'92re moving like the devil.\
Steve Rogers: We only got about a 10-second window. You miss that window, we\'92re bugs on a windshield.\
James Montgomery Falsworth: Mind the gap.\
Dum Dum Dugan: Better get moving, bugs!\
Jacques Dernier: Maintenant! (Now!) [ Steve, Bucky and Gabe zippline onto the train.]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: [watching Steve on a monitor, fighting his way through the train] Stop him! Fire again!\
James Barnes: [after Steve helps him out] I had him on the ropes.\
Steve Rogers: I know you did. [another trooper with a blaster appears] Get down!\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Fire again! Kill him! Now!\
Steve Rogers: [Bucky\'92s been blasted through a hole and is now hanging outside the train.] Bucky! Hang on! Grab my hand! NO!\
[Allied HQ in London, Phillips brings a tray of food to Zola after he\'92s been captured and imprisoned]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Sit down.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is this?\
Col. Chester Phillips: Steak.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: What is in it?\
Col. Chester Phillips: Cow. Doctor, do you realize how difficult it is to get ahold of a prime cut like that out here?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: I don\'92t eat meat.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Why not?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: It disagrees with me.\
Col. Chester Phillips: How about cyanide? Does that give you the rumbly tummy too? Every Hydra agent that we\'92ve tried to take alive has crunched a little pill before we can stop him. But not you. So, here\'92s my brilliant theory. [Phillips starts eating the steak.] You wanna live.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: You\'92re trying to intimidate me, Colonel.\
Col. Chester Phillips: I bought you dinner. [passes him a piece of paper which Zola reads out loud]\
Dr. Arnim Zola: \'91Given the variable information he has provided, and in exchange for his full cooperation, Dr. Zola is being remanded to Switzerland.\'92\
Col. Chester Phillips: I sent that message to Washington this morning. Of course it was encoded. You guys haven\'92t broken those codes, have you? That would be awkward.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt will know this is a lie.\
Col. Chester Phillips: He\'92s gonna kill you anyway, Doc. You\'92re a liability. You know more about Schmidt than anyone. And the last guy you cost us was Captain Rogers\'92 closest friend. So, I wouldn\'92t count on the very best of protection. There\'92s you or Schmidt. It\'92s just the hand you\'92ve been dealt.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Schmidt believes he walks in the foot steps of the Gods.\
Col. Chester Phillips: Mmm.\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Only the world itself will satisfy him.\
Col. Chester Phillips: You do realize that\'92s nuts, don\'92t you?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: But the sanity of the plan is of no consequence.\
Col. Chester Phillips: And why is that?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: Because he can do it!\
Col. Chester Phillips: What\'92s his target?\
Dr. Arnim Zola: His target\'85 is everywhere.\
[Hydra main base, Schmidt addresses his soldier]\
Johann Schmidt: Tomorrow, Hydra will stand master of the world. Born to victory on the wings of the Valkyrie. Our enemies weapons will be powerless against us. If they shoot down one plane, hundreds more will rain fire upon them! If they cut off one head, two more shall take its place. Hail Hydra! [his soldiers all start saluting and shouting \'91Hail Hydra\'92]\
[In London, a part of the city destroyed by bombs, formerly the bar where Steve enlisted the Howling Commandos. Peggy follows the voice of a radio through the rubble.]\
Man on the Radio: Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area. Please wait for the all-clear. Your attention, please. All citizens shall remain indoors until further notice. Blackout is still in effect throughout the London area.\
Steve Rogers: [when Peggy finds him he\'92s pouring himself some drink] Dr. Erskine said that\'85 the serum wouldn\'92t just effect my muscles, it would effect my cells. Create a protective system of regeneration and healing. Which means um\'85I can\'92t get drunk. Did you know that?\
Peggy Carter: Your metabolism burns four times faster than the average person. He thought it could be one of the side effects. [referring to Barnes getting killed] It wasn\'92t your fault.\
Steve Rogers: Did you read the reports?\
Peggy Carter: Yes.\
Steve Rogers: Then you know that\'92s not true.\
Peggy Carter: You did everything you could. Did you believe in your friend? Did you respect him? [Steve looks at her as if to say yes] Then stop blaming yourself. Allow Barnes the dignity of his choice. He damn well must have thought you were worth it.\
Steve Rogers: I\'92m goin\'92 after Schmidt. I\'92m not gonna stop till all of Hydra is dead or captured.\
Peggy Carter: You won\'92t be alone.\
[The team prepare a battle plan to take down Red Skull at his headquarters]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Johann Schmidt belongs in a bug house. He thinks he\'92s a God. He\'92s willing to blow up half the world to prove it, starting with the USA.\
Howard Stark: Schmidt\'92s working with powers beyond our capabilities. He gets across the Atlantic, he will wipe out the entire eastern sea board in an hour.\
Gabe Jones: How much time we got?\
Col. Chester Phillips: According to my new best friend, under twenty four hours.\
Jaques Dernier: Where is he now?\
Col. Chester Phillips: Hydra\'92s last base is here. [holding a photo he points to the base] In the Alps. Five hundred feet below the surface.\
Jim Morita: So, what are we supposed to do. I mean, it\'92s not like we can just knock on the front door.\
Steve Rogers: Why not? That\'92s exactly what we\'92re gonna do.\
[after Steve has been captured by Hydra soldiers and brought to Schmidt\'92s weapon lab]\
Johann Schmidt: Arrogance may not be a uniquely American trait, but I must say you do it better than anyone. But there are limits to what even you can do, Captain. Or did Erskine tell you otherwise?\
Steve Rogers: He told me you were insane.\
Johann Schmidt: Ah. He resented my genius and tried to deny me what was rightfully mine. But he gave you everything. So, what made you so special?\
Steve Rogers: Nothin\'92. I\'92m just a kid from Brooklyn. [after Schmidt has beaten him] I can do this all day.\
Johann Schmidt: Oh, of course you can. Of course. But unfortunately I am on a tight schedule. [Schmidt takes out his cube-energy pistol and points it at Steve]\
Steve Rogers: So am I! [just then Steve\'92s team crashes through the windows of the weapons lab]\
James Montgomery Falsworth: Rogers! You might need this! [He throws Steve his shield.]\
Steve Rogers: Thanks! [Steve makes his way through the Hydra base which has fallen into chaos with the arrival of more Allied soldiers.]\
Jim Morita: [into his comm] We\'92re in! Assault team, go!\
Col. Chester Phillips: [standing outside listening to Morita] Move out! [the soldiers start running towards the Hydra base] Keep your spacing!\
[In the Hydra base]\
Hydra Soldier: Cutt off one head, two more shall\'85 [he\'92s killed by Phillips]\
Col. Chester Phillips: Let\'92s go find two more!\
[As Steve chases Schmidt he is confronted by a Hydra soldier with flame throwers and saved by Peggy]\
Steve Rogers: [after Peggy has killed the Hydra soldier] You\'92re late.\
Peggy Carter: Weren\'92t you about to\'85\
Steve Rogers: Right. [Steve continues his chase, but after Schmidt has boarded the Valkyrie Steve is not fast enough to catch the plane. Behin him Phillips and Peggy appear in a car and pick him up to chase the plane on the runway.] Keep it steady! [Just as Steve is about to leap from the roadster onto Schmidt\'92s plane Peggy stops him]\
Peggy Carter: Wait! [she kisses him] Go get him. [Steve surprised by the kiss looks at Phillips]\
Col. Chester Phillips: I\'92m not kissin\'92 you!\
[Inside the Valkyrie there are multiple figher planes with their targets written on them: Boston, Chicago, New York. After Steve has managed to disable the fighter planes and their pilots he enters the cockpit where Schmidt is waiting.]\
Johann Schmidt: You don\'92t give up, do you?\
Steve Rogers: Nope! [They fight]\
Johan Schmidt: You could have the power of the gods! Yet you wear a flag on your chest and think you fight a battle of nations! I have seen the future, Captain! There are no flags!\
Steve Rogers: Not my future! [He flings his shield at Schmidt who is thrown into the cubic console.]\
Johan Schmidt/Red Skull: What have you done? No. [he picks up the cube and energy starts to pour from it, revealing a window into space. A stream of blue energy engulfes Schmidt and takes him into the sky. The cube falls to the ground and burns through it until it falls into the sea below.]\
[Steve takes over the plane\'92s controls, on a screen he reads "Ziel New York City" (target New York City), and tries the radio which is picked up by the Hydra control tower occupied by Peggy, Phillips and Morita.]\
Steve Rogers: Come in. This is Captain Rogers. Do you read me?\
Jim Morita: Captain Rogers, what is your\'85 [Peggy takes his place]\
Peggy Carter: Steve, is that you? Are you alright?\
Steve Rogers: Peggy! Schmidt\'92s dead.\
Peggy Carter: What about the plane?\
Steve Rogers: That\'92s a little bit tougher to explain.\
Peggy Carter: Give me your coordinates, I\'92ll find you a safe landing site.\
Steve Rogers: There\'92s not going to be a safe landing. But I can try and force it down.\
Peggy Carter: I\'92ll get Howard on the line, he\'92ll know what to do.\
Steve Rogers: There\'92s not enough time. This thing\'92s moving too fast and it\'92s heading for New York. [referring to Schmidt\'92s plane, speaking through the plane\'92s control] I gotta put her in the water.\
Peggy Carter: Please, don\'92t do this. We have time. We can work it out.\
Steve Rogers: Right now I\'92m in the middle of nowhere. If I wait any longer a lot of people are gonna die. Peggy, this is my choice. [as he\'92s forcing the plane down towards the water] Peggy?\
Peggy Carter: I\'92m here.\
Steve Rogers: I\'92m gonna need a rain check on that dance.\
Peggy Carter: [with tears in her eyes] Alright. A week, next Saturday, at the Stork Club.\
Steve Rogers: You got it.\
Peggy Carter: Eight o\'92clock on the dot. Don\'92t you dare be late. Understood?\
Steve Rogers: You know, I still don\'92t know how to dance.\
Peggy Carter: I\'92ll show you how. Just be there.\
Steve Rogers: We\'92ll have the band play somethin\'92 slow. I\'92d hate to step on your\'85 [the line goes static and Peggy begins to cry]\
Peggy Carter: Steve? Steve? Steve?\
[Later, the world celebrates the victory over Nazi-Germany. The Howling Commandos are in a bar.]\
James Montgomery Falsworth: To the Captain. [They drink]\
[Stark on his search for the Valkyrie in the arctic sea on a ship. They\'92ve found the Tesseract.]\
Stark\'92s Engineer: Sir? [Stark steps to him and watches on a screen how a submarine grabs the cube.]\
Howard Stark: [to the captain] Take us to the next grid point.\
Stark\'92s Engineer: But there\'92s not trace of wreckage. And the energy signature stops here.\
Howard Stark: Just keep looking.\
[After Steve has been missing for some time, we see him awaken in a 1940\'92s hospital and he can hear a baseball game on an old radio when a woman walks into the room]\
Dodgers Announcer: [over the radio] Curve ball, high and outside for ball one. So the Dodgers are tied, 4-4. And the crowd well knows that with one swing of his bat, this fellow\'92s capable of making it a brand-new game again. Just an absolutely gorgeous day here at Ebbets Field. The Phillies have managed to tie up at 4-4. But the Dodgers have three men on. Pearson beaned Reiser in Philadelphia last month. Wouldn\'92t the youngster like a hit here to return the favour? Pete leans in. Here\'92s the pitch. Swung on. A line to the right. And it gets past Rizzo. Three runs will score. Reiser heads to third. Durocher\'92s going to wave him in. Here comes the relay, but they won\'92t get him. [the door opens and an agent walks in]\
SHIELD Agent: Good morning. [she checks her watch] Or should I say, afternoon?\
Steve Rogers: Where am I?\
SHIELD Agent: You\'92re in a recovery room in New York city.\
Dodgers Announcer: The Dodgers take the lead, 8-4. Oh, Dodgers! Everyone is on their feet. What a game we have here today, folks. What a game indeed.\
Steve Rogers: [he looks at her suspiciously] Where am I really?\
SHIELD Agent: I\'92m afraid I don\'92t understand.\
Steve Rogers: The game, it\'92s from May, nineteen forty one. I know, cause I was there. [he gets up from the bed] Now, I\'92m gonna ask you again. Where am I?\
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers\'85 [she secretly pushes an alarm]\
Steve Rogers: Who are you? [two soldiers in black uniform enter the room and Steve knocks them through the wall. Steve realizes that he\'92s on a some kind of made up set and he runs out of there.]\
SHIELD Agent: Captain Rogers, wait! [into a comm] All agents, code 13! I repeat. All agents, code 13!\
[Steve finds himself in 2011\'92s Time Square he looks around him in shock, numerous SUV\'92s encircle him and Fury steps out of one of the vehicles]\
Nick Fury: At ease, soldier! Look, I\'92m sorry about that little show back there, but\'85 we thought it best to break it to you slowly.\
Steve Rogers: Break what?\
Nick Fury: You\'92ve been asleep, Cap. For almost seventy years. [Steve looks around him in shock] You gonna be okay?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Yeah. I just\'85I had a date.\
[lines after end of credits; Steve\'92s is pummeling a punching bag in a gym and in anger knocks it off it\'92s chain, sending it flying across the room when Fury enters the gym]\
Nick Fury: Trouble sleeping?\
Steve Rogers: You\'92re here with a mission, sir?\
Nick Fury: I am.\
Steve Rogers: Trying to get me back in the world?\
Nick Fury: Trying to save it.\

[1989 \'96 Hank Pym enters a SHIELD facility and storms S.H.I.E.L.D's board room in the Triskelion]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Stark.\
Mitchell Carson: He doesn\'92t seem happy.\
Howard Stark: Hello, Hank. You\'92re supposed to be in Moscow.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I took a detour. [he places a vial containing a red serum on the table] Through your defense lab.\
Peggy Carter: Tell me that isn\'92t what I think it is.\
Dr. Hank Pym: It depends, if you think it\'92s a poor attempt to replicate my work. Even for this group, that takes nerve.\
Mitchell Carson: You were instructed to go to Russia. May I remind you, Dr. Pym, that you\'92re a soldier\'85\
Dr. Hank Pym: I\'92m a scientist.\
Howard Stark: Then act like one. The Pym Particle is the most revolutionary science ever developed, help us put it to good use.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you turn me into your errand boy, and now you try to steal my research?\
Mitchell Carson: If only you\'92d protected Janet with such ferocity, Dr. Pym.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, god. [suddenly Pym slams down Carson\'92s face on the table in anger, Peggy pulls him away]\
Peggy Carter: Easy, Hank.\
Dr. Hank Pym: You mention my wife again and I\'92ll show you ferocity. [Carson looks at Stark as he wipes blood from his nose]\
Howard Stark: Don\'92t look at me, you said it.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I formally tender my resignation.\
Howard Stark: We don\'92t accept it. Formally. Hank, we need you. The Pym Particle is a miracle. Please, don\'92t let your past determine the future.\
Dr. Hank Pym: As long as I am alive, nobody will ever get that formula. [Pym turns around and leaves calmly]\
Mitchell Carson: We shouldn\'92t let him leave the building.\
Peggy Carter: You\'92ve already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?\
Mitchell Carson: Yes! Our scientists haven\'92t come close to replicating his work.\
Howard Stark: He just kicked your ass full size. You really want to find out what it\'92s like when you can\'92t see him coming? I\'92ve known Hank Pym for a long time, he\'92s no security risk. Unless we make him one.\

[Present Day \'96 Scott Lang is in prison getting punched in the face by another prisoner, Peachy]\
Peachy: You like that? You like that? Come get you some then! [the other prisoners are gathered around them cheering them along]\
    [Scott tries to hit Peachy in the stomach but he doesn\'92t flinch]\
Scott Lang: You didn\'92t even move.\
Peachy: Nah.\
Scott Lang: I mean, what if I come in on the left side, right? Just out here and see this here\'85 [suddenly Scott punches Peachy in the face]\
Peachy: I\'92m gonna miss you, Scott.\
Scott Lang: I\'92m gonna miss you too, Peachy. [they shake hands] Man, you guys got the weirdest goodbye rituals. [Scott says goodbye to the other inmates]\
\
[Scott is escorted out of the prison and is met by his friend Luis]\
Luis: Scotty! What\'92s up, man! Damn!\
Scott Lang: Hey! Hey, man.\
    [they embrace each other]\
Luis: Hey, what\'92s up with your eye?\
Scott Lang: Oh, well, what do you think. Peachy. His going away present.\
Luis: Oh, yeah, I still got my scar from a year ago.\
Scott Lang: Oh yeah.\
Luis: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. You know what? I\'92m still the only one to knock him out.\
Scott Lang: Well, I definitely didn\'92t.\
    [they get into Luis\'92s truck and drive off]\
\
[as Luis drives him home]\
Scott Lang: Thanks for picking me up, brother.\
Luis: Oh, you know, you think I\'92m gonna miss my cellie getting out?\
Scott Lang: Hey, how\'92s your girl, man?\
Luis: Uh, she left me.\
Scott Lang: Oh.\
Luis: Yeah, my mom died too. And my dad got deported. But I got the van!\
Scott Lang: It\'92s nice!\
Luis: Yeah, right?\
Scott Lang: Thanks for the hook-up too. I needed a place to stay.\
Luis: You wait \'91til you see this couch, you\'92re gonna be really happy. You\'92re gonna be on your feet in no time, watch.\
Scott Lang: I hope so.\
Luis: Yeah. And I gotta introduce you to some people, some really skilled people.\
Scott Lang: Not interested.\
Luis: Yeah right!\
Scott Lang: No, I\'92m serious, man. I\'92m not going back. I got a daughter to take care of.\

[we see Scott working at Baskin Robbins]\
Scott Lang: Welcome to Baskin Robbins. Would you like to try our Mango Fruit Blast?\
Ice Cream Store Customer: Uh, no thanks. Um, I will have\'85 I\'92ll have a burger, please.\
Scott Lang: Oh, we don\'92t\'85 we don\'92t make that.\
Ice Cream Store Customer: Pretzel. Hot pretzel, like, mustard\'85 in mustard dip?\
Scott Lang: It\'92s ice cream. Baskin Robbins.\
Ice Cream Store Customer: I\'92ll just do with whatever\'92s hot and fresh.\
Scott Lang: Dude.\
[Scott\'92s boss, Dale interrupts him serving the idiot customer]\
Dale: Can I see you in the back, chief? Pronto.\
Scott Lang: Sure thing, Dale. Darby, could you just, uh\'85 [points to the customer] \'85take care of this idiot? Thanks.\
\
[Scott enters Dale\'92s office]\
Scott Lang: Hiya, Dale.\
Dale: Come on in. Pull up some chair.\
    [Scott sits down]\
Dale: Three years in San Quentin, huh?\
Scott Lang: You found out.\
Dale: Baskin Robbins always finds out.\
Scott Lang: Look, I\'92m sorry, alright, but I\'85 no one would hire me.\
Dale: Breaking and entering. Grand larceny.\
Scott Lang: Look, I\'92m\'85 I\'92m sorry, I\'85 you know, it was\'85 I don\'92t do it anymore. I\'92m just trying\'85\
Dale: Respect. I couldn\'92t be happier about it.\
Scott Lang: Really?\
Dale: Yeah, yeah.\
Scott Lang: Oh, thank you, thank you.\
Dale: You really stuck it to those billionaire S.O.Bs. And the more I read about what you did and stuff, I\'92m like, \'93Wow, I know this guy? I\'92m in charge of this guy?\'94 Yeesh!\
Scott Lang: Well, I\'92m very happy in this job, and I\'92m\'85 I really just appreciate the opportunities and\'85\
Dale: Yeah, yeah. Well, you\'92re fired of course. I mean, I can\'92t really keep you on.\
Scott Lang: Wait, what? Fired?\
Dale: Yeah.\
Scott Lang: Dale, look, it wasn\'92t a violent crime, I mean, I\'92m a good worker.\
Dale: No, it wasn\'92t a violent crime. It was a cool crime. I\'92ll tell you what, though, this\'92d be totally off the books, off the records, but, uh\'85 if you want to grab one of those Mango Fruit Blasts on your way out the door, I\'92ll just pretend I didn\'92t see it.\

[after getting fired from Baskin Robbins, Scott returns to the Luis\'92s apartment]\

Scott Lang: I was, I got fired.\
Luis: Damn! They find out who you are?\
Scott Lang: Yep.\
Luis: Baskin Robbins always finds out, bro.\
Dave: Baskin Robbins don\'92t play.\
Luis: You want some waffles?\
Scott Lang: Yeah, I\'92ll take a waffle.\
Luis: Oh. That\'92s Kurt. He was in Folsom for 5 years, he\'92s a wizard on that laptop.\
Kurt: Nice to meet you.\
Scott Lang: Yeah, nice to meet you too. [to Dave] And who are you?\
Dave: Dave. Nice work on the Vista job.\
Kurt: Vista job? Yes. No, no, I have heard of this robbery.\
Scott Lang: Well, technically, I didn\'92t rob them. Robbery involves threat. I hate violence, I burgled them. I\'92m a cat burglar.\
Dave: You mean you\'92re a pussy?\
Scott Lang: Yeah.\
Luis: They were overcharging the customers, right? And it added up to millions. He blows the whistle and he gets fired. And what does he do? He hacks into the security system, and transfers millions back to the people that they stole it from.\
Dave: Posts all the bank records online.\
Luis: And he drove dude\'92s Bentley into a swimming pool.\
Scott Lang: What are you doing? Hmm? Why are you telling my life\'92s story to these guys? What do you want?\
Luis: Okay. My cousin talked to this guy two weeks ago about this little, perfect job.\
Scott Lang: No way.\

Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I\'92m still alive.\
  [the guard smiles and lets Pym drive through the gate, Pym then enters the building]\
Pym Tech Security Guard: I.D.\
Dr. Hank Pym: [referring to the massive painting of Pym in his younger days hanging behind the guard] Perhaps that will suffice.\
Pym Tech Security Guard: I\'92m very sorry, sir. Please come in.\
Pym Tech Employee: Is that Hank Pym?\
Hope van Dyne: Good morning, Hank.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope. Would it kill you to call me dad?\
Hope van Dyne: Well, Dr. Cross will be so please that you could find the time to join us today.\
Darren Cross: More like, thrilled.\
[Cross walks over to Pym and shakes his hand]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I was surprised to receive any kind of invitation from you, Darren. What\'92s the occasion?\
Darren Cross: Oh, you\'92ll see. Won\'92t he, Hope?\
[Hope gives Pym a cold look]\
Hope van Dyne: We\'92re ready for you inside.\
[Hope walks away]\
Darren Cross: Ouch. [referring to Hope] I guess some old wounds never heal, huh? Don\'92t worry, she\'92s in good hands. You\'92re in for a treat.\
[Carson comes over to Pym as they are about to enter the lab]\
Carson: Long time no see, Dr. Pym. How\'92s retirement? [they shake hands]\
Dr. Hank Pym: How\'92s your face?\
[Carson enters the lab]\
Hope van Dyne: After you.\
[Pym enters the lab]\
Darren Cross: Now before we start I\'92d like to introduce a very special guest, this company\'92s founder and my mentor, Dr. Hank Pym. [everyone in the lab claps, at the same time Pym notices the miniature building of Pym Technologies has now got the logo Cross Technologies on it] When I took over this company for Dr. Pym, I immediately started researching a particle that could change the distance between atoms while increasing density and strength. Why this revolutionary idea remained buried beneath the dust and cobwebs of Hank\'92s research, I couldn\'92t tell you. But just imagine. A soldier the size of an insect. The ultimate secret weapon. [he shows everyone footage reel of soldiers getting killed but with a tiny costumed figure also every footage] An \'93Ant-Man\'94. [pointing to Pym] That\'92s what they called you. Right, Hank? Silly, I know. Propaganda. Tales to astonish. Trumped up B.S. to scare the U.S.S.R. Hank, will you tell our guests what you told me every single time I asked you, was the Ant-Man real?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Just a tall tale.\
Darren Cross: Right. Because how could anything so miraculous possibly be real? [Cross leads everyone into another room] Well I was inspired by the legend of the Ant-Man. And with my breakthrough, shrinking inorganic material, I thought, could it be possible to shrink a person? Could that be done? Well, it\'92s not a legend anymore. Distinguished guests, I am proud to present the end of warfare as we know it: the Yellowjacket. [he shows them a yellow insect sized suit] The Yellowjacket is an all-purpose weapon of war capable of altering the size of the wearer for the ultimate combat advantage. [he puts on a video]\
Video Voice Over: We live in an era in which the weapons we use to protect ourselves are undermined by constant surveillance. It\'92s time to return to a simpler age. One where the powers of freedom can once again operate openly to protect their interests. An all-purpose peace-keeping vessel. The Yellowjacket can manage any conflict on the Geo-political landscape, completely unseen. Efficient in both preventative measures and tactical assault. Practical applications include: surveillance, industrial sabotage, and the elimination of obstructions on the road to peace. A single Yellowjacket offers the user unlimited influence to carry out protective actions and one day soon, an army of Yellowjackets will create a sustainable environment of well-being around the world. The Yellowjacket.\
Frank: So it\'92s a suit.\
Darren Cross: Don\'92t be crude, Frank. It\'92s not a suit, it\'92s a\'85 it\'92s a vessel. What\'92s a matter, you\'92re not impressed?\
Frank: Oh, I\'92m impressed. I\'92m also concerned. Imagine what our enemies could do with this tech.\
Darren Cross: We should have a longer conversation about that, Frank. I really value your opinion. Thank you for coming. Hope?\
Hope van Dyne: Thank you very much, everybody. I will escort you out now. Thank you.\
Darren Cross: You seem a bit shocked.\
[as everyone leaves the room Pym walks over to Cross]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, there\'92s a reason that I buried these secrets.\
Darren Cross: So you finally admit it. We could\'92ve done this together, Hank. But you ruined that. That\'92s why you\'92re the past and I\'92m the future.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Don\'92t do this.\
Mitchell Carson: Dr. Cross. [Cross goes over to Carson] You sell to me first, twenty percent of your asking price, I can have the cash here in two weeks.\
Darren Cross: Deal.\
Hope van Dyne: [after everyone leaves Cross\'92 presentation Hope goes over to Pym] We have to make our move, Hank.\
Dr. Hank Pym: How close is he?\
Hope van Dyne: He still can\'92t shrink a live subject. Just give me the suit and let me finish this once and for all.\
Dr. Hank Pym: No.\
Hope van Dyne: I have Cross\'92 complete trust.\
Dr. Hank Pym: It\'92s too dangerous.\
Hope van Dyne: We don\'92t have a choice.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Well, that\'92s not entirely true.\
Hope van Dyne: I think I found a guy.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Who?\
[Scott shows up at his daughter\'92s birthday party]\
\
Cassie Lang: Daddy!\
[she rushes towards Scott, he catches Cassie in his arms and embraces her]\
Scott Lang: Peanut! Oh! Happy birthday! I\'92m so sorry I\'92m late, I didn\'92t know what time your party started.\
Cassie Lang: It was on the invitation!\
[Scott\'92s ex-wife\'92s fianc\'e9 Paxton interrupts them]\
Paxton: He didn\'92t get an invitation! But he came anyway.\
Scott Lang: Well, I\'92m not going to miss my little girl\'92s birthday party.\
Cassie Lang: I\'92m gonna go tell mommy you\'92re here.\
Scott Lang: Oh, you don\'92t\'85\
[Cassie turns and runs off]\
Paxton: What are you doing here, Lang? You haven\'92t paid a dime in child support. You know, right now if I wanted to, I could arrest you.\
Scott Lang: It\'92s good to see you too, Paxton.\
[Cassie comes back]\
Cassie Lang: Mommy\'92s so happy you\'92re here, she choked on her drink.\
Scott Lang: Hey, look what I have for you.\
[he hands her the small bag he\'92d brought]\
Cassie Lang: Can I open it now?\
Paxton: Of course sweetheart, it\'92s your birthday.\
[she takes out an ugly looking rabbit which talks]\
Hideous Rabbit: You\'92re my bestest friend!\
Paxton: [referring to the toy rabbit] What is that thing?\
Cassie Lang: He\'92s so ugly! I love him! Can I go show my friends?\
Paxton: Yeah, of course sweetheart, go ahead.\
[Cassie runs off with the ugly rabbit to show her friends]\
Hideous Rabbit: You\'92re my bestest friend!\
Scott Lang: Look, the child support is coming. Alright? It\'92s just hard finding a job when you have a record.\
Paxton: I\'92m sure you\'92ll figure it out, but for now I want you out of my house.\
Scott Lang: No, wait, it\'92s my daughter\'92s birthday!\
Paxton: It\'92s my house!\
Scott Lang: So what, it\'92s my kid!\
[Maggie walks over to them]\
Maggie Lang: Scott! You can\'92t just show up here, you know that. Come on.\
Scott Lang: It\'92s her birthday party.\
Maggie Lang: Yeah, I know, but you can\'92t just show up.\
Scott Lang: She\'92s my daughter.\
Paxton: You don\'92t know the first thing about being a father.\
Scott Lang: Maggie, I tell you this as a friend, and as the first love of my life, your fianc\'e9 is an ass-hat.\
Maggie Lang: He\'92s not an ass-hat.\
Paxton: Hey, watch your language. Okay?\
Scott Lang: Oh, what language. I said hat.\
[Maggie takes Scott out of the house]\
Scott Lang: Really, Maggie? That guy? Come on, you could marry anyone you want, you have to get engaged to a cop?\
Maggie Lang: At least he\'92s not a crook.\
Scott Lang: I\'92m trying, okay? I\'92ve changed, and I\'92m straight, I had a job, and\'85 I want to provide. I had a lot of time to think about it, and I love her. So much. I\'92ve missed so much time and I want to be a part of her life. What do I do?\
Maggie Lang: Get an apartment. Get a job, pay child support. And then we will talk about visitation, I promise. You\'92re her hero, Scott. Just, be the person that she already thinks you are.\
[Scott gets into Luis\'92s van, Cassie waves goodbye to him as he drives off honking the musical horn]\
[Frank is in the bathroom taking a leak]\
\
Darren Cross: I\'92m sorry you have such deep concerns about the Yellowjacket, Frank.\
[Frank turns back in surprise to find Cross standing there watching him]\
Frank: Yeah, well, uh, unfortunately we can\'92t just do whatever we want. Would be nice though, right?\
[he chuckles as he washes his hands]\
Frank: But there are laws.\
Darren Cross: What laws? Of man? The laws of nature transcend the laws of man, and I\'92ve transcended the laws of nature.\
Frank: Darren, I don\'92t think you understand\'85\
[suddenly Cross uses a small device on Frank which vaporizes him into a blob of goo]\
Darren Cross: Hm. We still haven\'92t worked out all the bugs.\
[Cross uses a tissue to wipe the goo off the sink and dumps it into one of the toilets]\
Darren Cross: Goodbye, Frank.\
[he flushes the toilet and washes his hands]\
[Cross and Hope are having dinner at a restaurant]\
\
Darren Cross: You know I\'92ve been thinking a lot about gratitude lately, and today during my morning meditation, an interesting thought occurred to me and I think it might apply to you too.\
Hope van Dyne: How\'92s that?\
Darren Cross: Gratitude can be forgiveness. I spent years carrying around my anger for Hank Pym. I devoted my genius to him. I could\'92ve worked anywhere. I chose my mentor poorly. You didn\'92t even have a choice. He never believed in you. It\'92s a shame what we had to do, but he forced us to do it, didn\'92t he? But we shouldn\'92t be angry, we should be grateful. Because his failures as a mentor, as a father, forced us to spread our wings.\
Hope van Dyne: You\'92re a success, Darren. You deserve everything coming your way.\
[after sitting outside in the van trying to figure how many days he\'92s got left to see Cassie again, Scott returns to Luis\'92s apartment]\
\
Luis: Hey, what\'92s up, hotshot?\
[Scott doesn\'92t reply]\
Dave: Maybe he didn\'92t hear you.\
Luis: How was the party?\
[Scott goes to the fridge, takes out a beer bottle and takes a swig from it]\
Scott Lang: Tell me about that tip.\
Luis: What?\
Scott Lang: I want to know about that tip.\
Luis: Ooh, baby, it\'92s on!\
Dave: Hot dog!\
Luis: It\'92s so on right now!\
Dave: Look who grew a pair!\
Scott Lang: Calm down, alright? I just need to know where it came from, it\'92s gotta be airtight.\
Luis: Okay. I was at a wine tasting with my cousin Ernesto, which was mainly reds, and you know I don\'92t love reds man, you know? But there was a ros\'e9 that saved the day, it was delightful. And he tells me about this girl Emily that we used to kick it with, it was actually the first pair of boobs that I ever touched.\
Scott Lang: It\'92s the wrong details. It\'92s wrong\'85 It has nothing to do with the story. Go!\
Luis: So, uh, he tells me that she\'92s working as a housekeeper now, right? And she\'92s dating this dude Carlos who\'92s a shot caller from across the bay and she tells him about the dude that she\'92s cleaning for. Right? That he\'92s, like, this big-shot CEO that is all retired now but he\'92s loaded. And so, Carlos and Ernesto are on the same softball team and they get to talking, right? And here comes the good part. Carlos says: \'93Yo, man. This guy\'92s got a big-ass safe just sitting in the basement, just chillin\'92.\'94 Of course Ernesto comes to me cause he knows I\'92ve got mad thieving skills. Of course I ask him: \'93Did Emily tell Carlos to tell you to get to me what kind of safe it was? And he says: \'93Nah, dog. All she said is that it\'92s, like, super legit, and whatever\'92s in it has gotta be good!\
Scott Lang: What?\
Kurt: Old man have safe.\
Luis: And he\'92s gone for a week.\
Scott Lang: Alright. There\'92s an old man, he\'92s got a safe, and he\'92s gone for a week. Let\'92s just work with that.\
Luis: Y\'92know what I\'92m sayin\'92?\
[we see the group getting prepared and gathering the right gear for the robbery]\
\
Kurt: Landlines cut, cell signals jammed. No one will be making for distress call tonight.\
Luis: All check.\
Kurt: Check.\
Dave: Check.\
Luis: If the job goes bad, you know I got your back, right?\
Scott Lang: Don\'92t worry, it\'92s not gonna happen. [Scott leaves the van]\
Luis: I love it when he gets cocky. [as they guys stay in the van they watch Scott hop the fence into the house]\
Dave: Damn! [through his earpiece] Alarm is dead.\
Luis: Nice!\
Scott Lang: Alright, I\'92m moving through the house.\
[inside the house Scott finds a door with a thumbprint scanner]\
Scott Lang: There\'92s a fingerprint lock on the door.\
Luis: It\'92s got a what? Ernesto didn\'92t tell me nothin\'92 about that. Aw, man, are we screwed?\
Scott Lang: Not necessarily.\
[Scott quickly uses several household items to get a fingerprint from a door knob and uses that to successfully pass the thumbprint scanner]\
Scott Lang: I\'92m in.\
Kurt: No alarms have been triggered. He\'92s in like the Flynn.\
[Scott opens the door and immediately sees the safe made of strong metal]\
Scott Lang: Oh, man.\
Luis: What is it?\
Scott Lang: Well they weren\'92t kidding, this safe is serious.\
Luis: How serious we talkin\'92, Scotty?\
Scott Lang: It\'92s a Carbondale. It\'92s from 1910, made from the same steel as the Titanic.\
Luis: Wow. Can you crack it?\
Scott Lang: Well, here\'92s the thing. It doesn\'92t do so well in the cold. Remember what that iceberg did?\
Luis: Yeah, man, it killed DiCaprio.\
Dave: It killed everybody.\
Kurt: But not the old lady. She still threw the jewel into the oceans.\
[Scott gets to work to try and open the safe]\
Luis: What are you doing?\
Scott Lang: I poured water in the locking mechanism and froze it with nitrogen. Ice expands, metal doesn\'92t.\
Luis: What are you doing now?\
Scott Lang: Waiting. Waiting.\
[the safe door breaks open]\
Scott: Nice.\
[Scott looks inside the safe]\
Luis: What is it, cash? Jewels?\
Scott Lang: Well there\'92s nothing here.\
Luis: What\'92d you say?\
[Scott notices some blueprints and the original Ant-Man suit]\
Scott Lang: It\'92s a suit.\
Luis: What?\
Scott Lang: It\'92s an old motorcycle suit.\
Luis: There\'92s no cash, no jewelry, nothing?\
Scott Lang: No. It\'92s a bust.\
Luis: I\'92m really sorry, Scotty. I know you needed a score.\
[we see an ant with a camera on its back nearby recording Scott take the suit, inside his lab Hank is watching Scott]\
[back at Pym Technologies Cross is about to perform the shrinking experiments with a lamb]\
\
Hope van Dyne: I thought we were using mice?\
Darren Cross: What\'92s the difference? Commence experiment 34C, organic atomic reduction.\
Hope van Dyne: Darren, maybe we should think\'85\
Darren Cross: Shrinking organic tissue is the centerpiece of this technology. I can\'92t go to the buyers with half a breakthrough.\
[Cross initiates the experiment and the lamb is vaporized to goo to Hope\'92s shock]\
Darren Cross: Experiment 34C results: Negative. [to the lab tech] Sanitize the workstation, bring in subject 35C.\
[back at Luis\'92s apartment in the bathroom, Scott looks at the suit he took from the safe]\
\
Scott Lang: Why would you lock this up?\
[he takes out the suit and looks at the helmet]\
Scott Lang: So weird.\
[he tries the suit on and steps into the bathtub to get a better look at himself in the mirror]\
Luis: Scott, what\'92s up man?\
[Scott closes the shower curtain then looks at the buttons on the gloves]\
Scott Lang: I wonder\'85 what is this?\
[he presses the buttons and shrinks down to a tiny size]\
[in his tiny form Scott stand and looks around him in shock, Scott then hears Hank\'92s voice speaking through the mask]\
Dr. Hank Pym: The world sure seems different from down here, doesn\'92t it, Scott?\
Scott Lang: What? Who\'85 who said that?\
[Scott sees Luis open the shower curtains to take a shower]\
Scott Lang: Luis! Luis, down here!\
Dr. Hank Pym: It\'92s a trial by fire, Scott. Or in this case, water.\
[Luis turns on the water, after getting splashed around Scott falls out of the bathtub and onto the floor]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Guess you\'92re tougher than you thought.\
[Scott hears Luis about to get undressed]\
Scott Lang: Oh, I don\'92t want to see this.\
[as Luis drops his trousers onto the floor it knocks Scott through a hole in the apartment below]\
Scott Lang: Luis! Ahh! Son of a\'85 !\
[Scott falls into an apartment where a party is going on, he narrowly avoids getting stepped on before falling through the vent into another apartment gets sucked into a hoover, breaks out, encounters a mouse, then runs into a trap and is launched out the window where he returns to his normal size on top of a cab]\
Cab Driver: What the hell?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Not bad for a test drive. Keep the suit, I\'92ll be in touch.\
Scott Lang: No, no. No, thank you.\
[Scott packs the suit up and sneaks it back into house and returns it into the safe, but the police are waiting for him as he goes to leave]\
\
Cop on Speaker: Put it down on the ground! You are under arrest!\
Scott Lang: No, I didn\'92t steal anything! I was returning something I stole.\
[Scott realizes he\'92s admitted to stealing and reluctantly kneels on the ground as he\'92s arrested]\
[Paxton visits Scott as he\'92s sat in his cell]\
\
Paxton: You know, you almost had us convinced that you were going to change your ways. They were really rooting for you. It\'92s gonna break their hearts.\
Detective: You got a visitor.\
Scott Lang: Who?\
Detective: Your lawyer.\
Scott Lang: My lawyer?\
[Scott is taken to a room where Pym is sat waiting for him]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I told you I\'92d be in touch, Scott. I\'92m starting to think that you prefer the inside of a jail cell.\
Scott Lang: Oh, man.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Sit down.\
[we see ants crawling over the camera in the room to obscure the conversation]\
Scott Lang: Sir, I\'92m sorry I stole the suit. I don\'92t even want to know why you have it.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Maggie was right about you.\
Scott Lang: How do you know about\'85 ?\
Dr. Hank Pym: The way she\'92s trying to keep you away from Cassie. The moment things get hard, you turn right back to crime. The way I see it, you have a choice. You can either spend the rest of your life in prison or go back to your cell and await further instructions.\
Scott Lang: I don\'92t understand.\
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I don\'92t expect you to. But you don\'92t have many options right now. Quite frankly, neither do I. Why do you think I let you steal that suit in the first place?\
Scott Lang: What?\
[flashback to Pym giving money to his housekeeper, Emily, so that she can tip Luis\'92s friends to tip off about the job]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: Second chances don\'92t come around all that much. So next time you think you might see one I suggest you take a real close look at it.\
[Pym rises and leaves the room]\
Maggie Lang: [referring to the ugly rabbit toy Scott gave her as Maggie is putting Cassie to sleep] Are you sure you don\'92t want a different toy?\
Maggie Lang: Are you sure you don\'92t want a different toy?\
Cassie Lang: No, I love this one.\
Maggie Lang: Okay. Well, get some sleep then. I love you. [Maggie kisses Cassie on her head]\
Cassie Lang: Mommy?\
Maggie Lang: Hm?\
Cassie Lang: Is daddy a bad man? I heard some grownups say he\'92s bad.\
Maggie Lang: No. Daddy just gets confused sometimes, you know?\
[as Scott is sat in his cell thinking several ants bring Scott the suit in its tiny form then enlarge it so that Scott can wear it, he quickly slip into it, zaps himself small to escape]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: Smart choice. You actually listened for once.\
[Scott runs out of the cell]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Under the door.\
[as the prison alarm goes off Scott runs out of the building]\
Scott Lang: Okay. Where to now?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang tight.\
[some ants approach Scott]\
Scott Lang: What? What?!\
[inside the police station]\
\
Paxton: Where the hell did he go?\
Detective: I have no idea, he just vanished. [into his radio] Set up a five block perimeter, now!\
[back to Scott; to the ants]\
Scott Lang: Get back, get back, get back!\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, these are my associates.\
Scott Lang: Huh? You got a camera on an ant? Yeah, sure, why not? Where\'92s the car?\
Dr. Hank Pym: No car, we\'92ve got wings. Incoming!\
[a large winged ant flies over Scott and lands in front of him]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Put your foot on the central node and not the thorax.\
Scott Lang: Are you ki\'85 ? How safe\'92s this\'85 ?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Get on the damn ant, Scott!\
[Scott gets on the ant and as it flies off the police go on a manhunt for him]\
[the winged ant has landed on a police car that\'92s looking for Scott]\
Scott Lang: Why am I on a police car? Shouldn\'92t I not be on a police car?\
Dr. Hank Pym: So they can give you a lift past their five block perimeter.\
Scott Lang: Whoa. Alright. Now, what\'92s the next move?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on tight.\
Scott Lang: Oh, this is easy. I\'92m getting the hang of this. Yank up to go up. It\'92s like a horse.\
Dr. Hank Pym: You\'92re throwing 2-47 off balance.\
Scott Lang: Wait, his name is 2-47?\
Dr. Hank Pym: He doesn\'92t have a name, he has a number Scott. Do you have any idea how many ants there are?\
[as the police car swerves]\
Scott Lang: Whoa!\
Dr. Hank Pym: Maybe it\'92s 2-48.\
[as the ant flies up]\
Scott Lang: No, no, no, no! Vertigo, vertigo!\
Dr. Hank Pym: No, I think it\'92s 2-47.\
Scott Lang: Wait.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on.\
Scott Lang: I think I\'92m getting the hang of this.\
[as ant flies Scott around the city]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I\'92m controlling 2-47. He is not listening to you.\
Scott Lang: What? Can I make one little request?\
Dr. Hank Pym: No.\
Scott Lang: Stop 2-47. Time out, time out. Time out. Alright, hold on. Just, wait. Whoa, uh! What happens if I throw up in this helmet?\
Dr. Hank Pym: It\'92s my helmet, Scott. Do not throw up.\
Scott Lang: Just set her down, alright? I\'92m getting light headed.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hang on, Scott.\
Scott Lang: Yeah, I\'92m getting a little light\'85 it\'92s funny\'85 hit me, and\'85\
[as the ant continues to fly Scott feels dizzy and falls off the ant\'92s back]\
[Scott wakes up in a bedroom and jumps up in shock when he sees Hope watching over him]\
\
Scott Lang: Hello. Who are you? Have you been standing there watching me sleep this whole time?\
Hope van Dyne: Yes.\
Scott Lang: Why?\
Hope van Dyne: Because the last time you were here you stole something.\
Scott Lang: Oh. Oh! Hey, look.\
[Scott goes to get out of bed but recoils when he sees insects crawling all over the floor]\
Scott Lang: Whoa!\
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata. Giant tropical bullet ants. Ranked highest on the Schmidt pain index. They\'92re here to keep an eye on you when I can\'92t. Dr. Pym\'92s waiting for you downstairs.\
[she turns and walks out of the room]\
Scott Lang: Who? [calling out to Hope] Hey, um, whose pajamas are these? [gets no response] How am I supposed to do this?\
[Scott puts his foot down tentatively onto the floor and the ants make space for his foot]\
Scott Lang: Right, just one step at a time.\
[he slowly stops towards the door as the ants make room for his feet]\
Scott Lang: Ugh. You don\'92t bite me, I don\'92t step on you, deal?\
[in the dining hall]\
Hope van Dyne: Take down the servers and Cross wouldn\'92t even know it. We don\'92t need this guy. [Scott enters the dining room where Pym and Hope are sat]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I assume that you\'92ve already met my daughter Hope.\
Scott Lang: I did. She\'92s great.\
Dr. Hank Pym: She doesn\'92t think that we need you.\
Hope van Dyne: We don\'92t. We can do this ourselves.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I go to all this effort to let you steal my suit, and then Hope has you arrested.\
Hope van Dyne: Okay, we can try this and when he fails I\'92ll do it myself.\
Dr. Hank Pym: She\'92s a little bit anxious. It has to do with this job, which, judging by the fact that you\'92re sitting opposite me, I take it that you\'92re interested in.\
Scott Lang: What job?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Would you like some tea?\
Scott Lang: Uh, sure. [Pym pours Scott some tea]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I was very impressed with how you managed to get past my security system. Freezing that metal was particularly clever.\
Scott Lang: Were you watching me?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I\'92ve been watching you for a while, ever since you robbed Vista Corp. Oh, excuse me, burgled Vista Corp. [Scott see Hope smile to herself] Vista\'92s security system is one of the most advanced in the business. It\'92s supposed to be unbeatable but you beat it. Would you like some sugar?\
Scott Lang: Yeah, thanks. [he sees two ants pushing two sugar cubes on the table towards his cup] You know what, I\'92m okay. [referring to the ants] How do you make them do that?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Ants can lift objects fifty times their weight. They build, farm, they cooperate with each other.\
Scott Lang: Right. But how do you make them do that? [he sees the ants returning the sugar cubes into their bowl]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I use electromagnetic waves to stimulate their olfactory nerve center. I speak to them. I can go anywhere, hear anything, and see everything.\
Hope van Dyne: And still know absolutely nothing. I\'92m late to meet Cross. [Hope gets up and leaves] [Scott raises his hand to ask a question]\
Scott Lang: Uh\'85 Dr. Pym?\
Dr. Hank Pym: You don\'92t need to raise your hand, Scott.\
Scott Lang: Sorry, I just have one question. Who are you? Who is she? What the hell\'92s going on and can I go back to jail now?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Come with me. [Pym takes Scott to his lab] Twenty years ago I created a formula that altered atomic relative distance.\
Scott Lang: Huh?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I learned how to change the distance between atoms, that\'92s what powers the suit, that\'92s why it works. [they enter Pym\'92s lab]\
Scott Lang: Whoa.\
Dr. Hank Pym: But it was dangerous. It was too dangerous. So I hid it from the world. And that\'92s when I switched gears and I started my own company.\
Scott Lang: Pym Tech.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes. I took on a young prot\'e9g\'e9 called Darren Cross.\
Scott Lang: Darren Cross. He\'92s a big deal.\
Dr. Hank Pym: But before he was a big deal he was my assistant. I thought I saw something in him, a son I never had perhaps. He was brilliant, but as we became close he began to suspect that I wasn\'92t telling him everything. He heard rumors about what was called the Pym Particles, and he became obsessed with recreating my formula. But I wouldn\'92t help him so he conspired against me and he voted me out of my own company.\
Scott Lang: How could he do that?\
Dr. Hank Pym: The board\'92s chairman is my daughter, Hope. She was the deciding vote. But she came back to me when she saw how close Cross was to cracking my formula. The process is highly volatile. What isn\'92t protected by a specialized helmet can affect the brain\'92s chemistry. I don\'92t think Darren realizes this, and you know, he\'92s not the most stable guy to begin with.\
Scott Lang: So, what do you want from me?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I believe that everyone deserves a shot at redemption. Do you?\
Scott Lang: I do.\
Dr. Hank Pym: If you can help me, I promise I can help you be with your daughter again. Now are you ready to redeem yourself?\
Scott Lang: Absolutely. My days of breaking into places and stealing shit are done. What do you want me to do?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I want you to break into a place and steal some shit. [Paxton receives a text from his partner, Gale, as he\'92s sat having breakfast with Maggie and Cassie]\
Maggie Lang: You going to be home for dinner tonight? [Paxton reads the text, \'93Lang\'92s \'93Lawyer\'94 is Dr. Hank Pym, as in Pym Tech]\
Paxton: Uh, yeah. I\'92ll pick something up, text you.\
Maggie Lang: Okay. Good news? [Paxton gets up to leave]\
Paxton: Uh, I don\'92t know. It\'92s news.\
Cassie Lang: Are you trying to find my daddy?\
Paxton: Yeah, I am, sweetheart. I just want your daddy to be safe.\
Cassie Lang: Hope you don\'92t catch him. [Pym is showing Scott photos of the people he used to worked with]\
Dr. Hank Pym: This isn\'92t the first time these guys have tried to get their hands on game changing weaponry. That\'92s Mitchell Carson, ex-head of defense at SHIELD, presently in the business of toppling governments. He always wanted my tech, and now, unless we break in and steal the Yellowjacket and destroy all the data, Darren Cross is gonna unleash chaos upon the world.\
Scott Lang: I think our first move should be calling the Avengers.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I\'92ve spent half my life trying to keep this technology out of the hands of a Stark. I\'92m sure as hell not gonna hand-deliver it to one now. This is not some cute technology like the Iron Man suit. This could change the texture of reality. Besides they\'92re probably too busy dropping cities out of the sky.\
Scott Lang: Okay, then why don\'92t you just send the ants?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, they are ants. Ants, they can do a lot of things, but they still need a leader. Somebody that can infiltrate a place that\'92s designed to prevent infiltration.\
Scott Lang: Hank, I\'92m a thief. Alright? I\'92m a good thief. But this is insane. [just then Hope enters the lab]\
Hope van Dyne: He\'92s right Hank and you know it. You\'92ve seen the footage, you know what Cross is capable of. I was against using him when we had months, now we have days. I\'92m wearing the suit.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Absolutely not!\
Hope van Dyne: I know the facility inside and out, I know how Cross thinks. I know this mission better than anybody here.\
Dr. Hank Pym: We need you close to Cross otherwise this mission cannot work.\
Hope van Dyne: We don\'92t have time to screw around.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope, please. Listen to me, please\'85\
Hope van Dyne: He is a criminal. I\'92m your daughter.\
Dr. Hank Pym: No! [Pym turns and sits down, Hope walks off in disappointment]\
Scott Lang: She\'92s right, Hank. I\'92m not your guy. Why don\'92t you wear the suit?\
Dr. Hank Pym: You think I don\'92t want to? I can\'92t. I spent years wearing it. It took a toll on me. You\'92re our only option. Before Hope lost her mother, she used to look at me like I was the greatest man in the world. And now she looks at me and it\'92s just disappointment. It\'92s too late for me, but not for you. This is your chance. The chance to earn that look in your daughter\'92s eyes, to become the hero that she already thinks you are. It\'92s not about saving our world, it\'92s about saving theirs.\
Scott Lang: Damn, that was a good speech.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, I need you to be the Ant-Man.\
[we see Scott wearing the Ant-Man suit with Pym and Hope training him]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: In the right hands, the relationship between man and suit is symbiotic. The suit has power, the man harnesses that power. You need to be skillful, agile, and above all, you need to be fast. You should be able to shrink and grow on a dime, so your size always suits your needs. [Hope closes the door] Now dive through the keyhole, Scott. You charge big, you dive small, then you emerge big. [Scott puts on the helmet and charges for the keyhole]\
Scott Lang: Ow! [we hear him fail several times as he continues to shrink and dive through the keyhole] Ah! Ow.\
Hope van Dyne: [to Pym] Useless.\
[Hope trains Scott]\
\
Hope van Dyne: When you\'92re small energy is compressed so you have the force of a two hundred pound man behind a fist a hundredth of an inch wide, you\'92re like a bullet. You punch too hard, you kill someone, too soft, it\'92s a love-tap. In other words you have to know how to punch.\
Scott Lang: I was in prison for three years, I know how to punch.\
Hope van Dyne: Show me. [she puts up her hands and Scott hits her hand] Terrible.\
Scott Lang: You want to show me how to punch? [he puts up his hand like hers] Show me\'85 [suddenly Hope punches him in the face knocking him back]\
Hope van Dyne: That\'92s how you punch.\
Dr. Hank Pym: She\'92s been looking forward to this.\
Scott Lang: No kiddin\'92.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope trained in martial arts at a, uh, difficult time.\
Hope van Dyne: Oh, by difficult time, he means when my mother died.\
Dr. Hank Pym: We lost her in a plane crash.\
Hope van Dyne: It\'92s bad enough you won\'92t tell me how she died, could you please stop telling me that lie. We\'92re working here. [as Scott is still recovering from her punch] Alright princess, let\'92s get back to work.\
Scott Lang: Were you going for the hand?\
[Pym finds Scott playing around with the suit\'92s regulator]\
\
Scott Lang: You know, I think this regulator is holding me back.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Do not screw with the regulator. If that regulator is compromised you would go sub-atomic.\
Scott Lang: What does that mean?\
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a quantum realm.\
Scott Lang: What does *that* mean?\
Dr. Hank Pym: It means that you would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant as you shrink for all eternity. Everything that you know, and love, gone forever.\
Scott Lang: Cool. Yeah. I\'92m\'85 if it ain\'92t broke.\
[return to training]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: You\'92ve learned about the suit, but you\'92ve yet to learn about your greatest allies: the ants. Loyal, brave, and your partners on this job.\
[Pym and Hope watch as Scott shrinks in their back garden and goes running under the earth]\
\
Hope van Dyne: Paratrechina longicornis, commonly known as crazy ants, they\'92re lightning fast and can conduct electricity which makes them useful to fry out enemy electronics. [Scott comes across a crazy ant]\
Scott Lang: Oh, you\'92re not so crazy. [the crazy ant jumps on him, knocking Scott back] Hey! You\'92re cute. [suddenly a herd of crazy ants crawl all over Scott] Oh! Aaah! [Scott turns himself back to normal size and he pops up through the ground] That was a lot scarier a second ago.\
[as they look at Pym Technologies building map]\
\
Scott Lang: It looks like the Futures lab has its own isolated power supply.\
Hope van Dyne: There\'92s a security guard posted around the clock, we\'92ll need you to take him out to deactivate the security systems.\
[shrunk again and back under the earth, Scott goes looking for more ants]\
\
Scott Lang: Okay. Who\'92s next? [a massive ant comes up behind Scott]\
Hope van Dyne: Paraponera clavata.\
Scott Lang: I know. Bullet ants, right? Number one on the Schmidt pain index. [to the ants] Hey, guys! Remember me from the bedroom? [as the ant goes to attack Scott pops back up the through the ground in his normal size] Whoa!\
[return to the Pym Technologies building map]\
\
Hope van Dyne: The Yellowjacket pod is hermetically sealed and the only access point is a tube we estimate to be about five millimeters in diameter.\
Scott Lang: Why do I have a sick feeling in my stomach?\
Hope van Dyne: The tube is protected by a laser grid and we can only power that down for fifteen seconds.\
Dr. Hank Pym: You\'92re going to need to signal the crazy ants to blow the servers, retrieve the suit, and exit the vaults, before the backup power comes on.\
[return to training]\
\
Hope van Dyne: [looking at another ant] Camponotus pennsylvanicus.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Alternatively known as a carpenter ant. Ideal for ground and air transport.\
Scott Lang: Wait a minute, I know this guy. I\'92m going to call him Ant-thony.\
Dr. Hank Pym: That\'92s good. That\'92s very good, because this time you\'92re really going to have to learn how to control him. [we see the ants pushing sugar cubes on the table] Tell them to put the sugar in the teacup.\
[we see Hope and Scott fight training, this time Scott lands a painful blow to Hope]\
\
Scott Lang: Oh, you okay, d\'85 [Hope suddenly punches Scott in the face and then knocks him down with her legs]\
[later as Scott is tending to his wound]\
\
Hope van Dyne: Hank wants you outside for target practice.\
Dr. Hank Pym: The suit has no weapons so I made you these discs. Red shrinks. Blue enlarges.\
Hope van Dyne: [referring to another species of ant] Solenopsis mandibularis.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Known for their bite, the fire ants have evolved into remarkable architects. They are handy to get you in and out of difficult places.\
[back to Scott trying to get some ants to put the sugar cubes into the teacup]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: You can do it Scott, come on. [one of the ants flies off and Scott takes off his earpiece in frustration]\
Scott Lang: They\'92re not listening to me.\
Hope van Dyne: You have to commit, you have to mean it. No shortcuts, no lies.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Throwing insults into the mix will not do anyone any good, Hope.\
Hope van Dyne: We don\'92t have time for coddling.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Our focus should be on helping Scott!\
Hope van Dyne: Really? Is that where our focus should be? [Hope picks up the earpiece and uses it to instruct the ants to put the sugar cube into the teacup, then she gets a herd of ants to appear]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Hope! [looking upset Hope walks over to Pym]\
Hope van Dyne: I don\'92t know why I came to you in the first place. [Hope leaves]\
Dr. Hank Pym: We can\'92t do this without her.\
[as Hope is about to leave in her car Scott gets in]\
\
Hope van Dyne: Oh, God.\
Scott Lang: You gotta lock your doors. I mean, really. There\'92s some weird folks in this neighborhood.\
Hope van Dyne: Do you think this is a joke? Do you have any idea what he\'92s asking you to risk? You have a daughter.\
Scott Lang: I\'92m doing this for her.\
Hope van Dyne: You know when my mother died I didn\'92t see him for two weeks?\
Scott Lang: He was in grief.\
Hope van Dyne: Yeah, so was I, and I was seven. And he never came back, not in any way that counted. He just sent me off to boarding school. You know, I thought, with all that\'92s at stake, just maybe we might have a chance at making peace. But even now he still wants to shut me out.\
Scott Lang: He doesn\'92t want to shut you out. He trusts you.\
Hope van Dyne: Then why are you here?\
Scott Lang: It proves that he loves you. Hope. Look at me. I\'92m expendable, that\'92s why I\'92m here. You must\'92ve realized that by now. I mean, that\'92s why I\'92m in the suit and you\'92re not. He\'92d rather lose than fight than lose you. Anyway\'85 [Scott goes to get out of the car]\
Hope van Dyne: You know, I didn\'92t know you had a\'85 a daughter when I called the cops on you. What\'92s her name?\
Scott Lang: Cassie.\
Hope van Dyne: It\'92s a pretty name. You have to clear your mind, Scott. You have to make your thoughts precise, that\'92s how it works. Think about Cassie, about how badly you want to see her, and use that to focus. [she gives Scott the earpiece back to talk to the ants and places a coin on the dashboard] Open your eyes and just think about what you want the ants to do. [couple of ants arrive and Scott gets them to pick up the coin] That\'92s good. [they watch as Scott gets the ants to spin the coin]\
[Hope and Scott enter back into the house where Pym is waiting]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: Your mother convinced me to let her join me on my missions. They called her the Wasp. She was born to it. And there\'92s not a day that goes by that I don\'92t regret having said yes. It was 1987, separatists had hijacked a Soviet missile silo in Kursk and launched an ICBM at the United States. The only way to the internal mechanics was through solid titanium.\
[in flashback we see Pym in his Ant-Man suit and his wife in her Wasp suit intercepted the missile]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: I knew I had to shrink between the molecules to disarm the missile, but my regulator had sustained too much damage. Your mother, she didn\'92t hesitate.\
[we see Janet shrinking herself to stop the missile]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: Janet! No!\
[flash-forward]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: She turned off her regulator and went sub-atomic to deactivate the bomb. She was gone. Your mom died a hero. And I spent the next ten years trying to learn all I could about the quantum realm.\
Hope van Dyne: You were trying to bring her back.\
Dr. Hank Pym: But all I learned was we know nothing.\
Hope van Dyne: It\'92s not your fault. She made her choice. But why didn\'92t you tell me this sooner?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I was trying to protect you. I lost your mother. I didn\'92t mean to lose you too. [Hope begins to cry]\
Hope van Dyne: I\'92m sorry.\
Scott Lang: This is awesome. It\'92s awesome, you know? You guys are breaking down walls, you\'92re healing. It\'92s important. [Hope and Pym turn to look at him] I ruined the moment didn\'92t I?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes, you did, yes.\
Scott Lang: I\'92m gonna make some tea. [Scott turns and leaves]\
[we see Scott finally shrink down and dive through the keyhole]\
\
Scott Lang: Nailed it!\
[he then goes under the earth, gets to fly on an ant]\
\
Scott Lang: That\'92s a good boy, Ant-thony.\
[we see him successfully work with the ants getting them to follow him]\
\
Scott Lang: The final phase of your training will be a stealth incursion.\
[we see Scott in his shrunken form on the side of a plane]\
\
Scott Lang: It\'92s freezing! You couldn\'92t make a suit with a flannel lining?\
[back in Pym\'92s lab]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: We must retrieve this prototype of a signal decoy, it\'92s a device that I invented from my SHIELD days.\
Hope van Dyne: We need it to counteract the transmission blockers that Cross installed in the Futures vault.\
Dr. Hank Pym: It\'92s currently collecting dust in one of Howard Stark\'92s old storage facilities in upstate New York. Should be a piece of cake.\
[back to plane]\
\
Scott Lang: You\'92re over the target area. Disengage, now, Scott.\
[back on the plane Scott instructs the ants]\
\
Scott Lang: Squadron A, go. B, go. C, go. Alright, Ant-thony, please don\'92t drop me this time. [they jump off the plane] Ah, it feels like a big leap from sugar cubes to this.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Stay calm.\
Scott Lang: [approaching the "old Stark warehouse" he's supposed to burglarize] Uh, guys, we might have a problem. Hank, didn\'92t you say this was some old warehouse? [The "warehouse" comes into clearer view, with a large circle-A insignia on the roof denoting its role as the Avengers' base] It\'92s not! [we see that the warehouse is the new Avengers base] You son of a bitch!\
Hope van Dyne: Scott, get out of there.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort! Abort now.\
Scott Lang: No, it\'92s okay. It doesn\'92t look like anyone\'92s home. Ant-thony, get me to the roof.\
Dr. Hank Pym: He\'92s gonna lose the suit.\
Hope van Dyne: He\'92s gonna lose his life.\
[Scott lands in the roof of the new Avengers base]\
\
Scott Lang: Alright I\'92m on the roof of the target building.\
Hope van Dyne: Somebody\'92s home, Scott. [just then Sam Wilson in his Falcon flies in]\
Natasha Romanoff: [on Sam\'92s radio] What\'92s going on down there, Sam?\
Scott Lang: It\'92s the Falcon!\
Sam Wilson: [into his radio] I had a sensor trip but I\'92m not seeing anything. Wait a second.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Abort, Scott! Abort now.\
Scott Lang: It\'92s okay, he can\'92t see me.\
Sam Wilson: I can see you.\
Scott Lang: He can see me. [Scott enlarges himself back to normal size and waves to Falcon] Hi. I\'92m Scott.\
[to Pym back in the lab as they listen to Scott]\
\
Hope van Dyne: Did he just say \'93Hi I\'92m Scott?\'94\
[back to Avengers HQ]\
\
Sam Wilson: What are you doing here?\
Scott Lang: First off, I\'92m a big fan.\
Sam Wilson: Appreciate it. So who the hell are you?\
Scott Lang: I\'92m Ant-Man. [Sam smiles] Ant-Man?\
Scott Lang: What, you haven\'92t heard of me? No, you wouldn\'92t have heard of me.\
Sam Wilson: You want to tell me what you want?\
Scott Lang: I was hoping I could grab a piece of technology just for a few days, and then return it. I need it to save the world. You know how that is.\
Sam Wilson: I know exactly how that is. [into his radio] Located the breach. Bringing him in.\
Scott Lang: Sorry about this! [just as Sam goes to grab Scott he shrinks himself, hits Sam and runs off]\
Dr. Hank Pym: What the hell are you doing? [Sam chases after Scott]\
Sam Wilson: Breach is an adult male who has some sort of shrinking tech. [Sam flies in and lands to stamp on Scott but Scott manages to intercept it and fights off Sam]\
Scot Lang: Sorry. Sorry about this. Sorry [Scott jumps around Sam while punching him]\
Sam Wilson: That\'92s enough! [Sam punches Scott as he jumps at him]\
Scott Lang: Ant-thony, a little help. [Ant-thony flies in, Scott jump on his back and they fly into a vent and Sam goes to find him]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I\'92ve lost visual! [suddenly Sam bursts through one of the facility doors]\
Sam Wilson: He\'92s inside my pack.\
Scott Lang: Sorry. You seem like a really great guy. [they fight but Scott gets manages to disable Sam\'92s flight pack then flies off on Ant-thony; into his radio]\
Sam Wilson: It\'92s really important to me that Cap never finds out about this.\
[back to Pym house]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: That was completely irresponsible and dangerous! You jeopardized everything! [Scott takes Pym\'92s signal decoy out of his pocket and places it on the table]\
Hope van Dyne: You got it. [Scott nods his head]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Well done.\
Scott Lang: Wait a minute. Did you just compliment me? He did, didn\'92t he?\
Hope van Dyne: Kind of sounded like he did.\
Dr. Hank Pym: I was good, wasn\'92t I?\
Scott Lang: Hey, how about the fact that I fought an Avenger, and didn\'92t die?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Now let\'92s not dwell on the past. We gotta finish our planning. [Pym turns and leaves with the signal decoy]\
Hope van Dyne: Don\'92t mind him. You did good. [Pym enters his living room to find Cross standing there]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren. How the hell did you get in here? [Pym closes the door]\
Darren Cross: You left the front door open, Hank. It\'92s official. You\'92re old. [Hope and Scott hear them from the kitchen]\
Hope van Dyne: The plans! He will kill him. [back with Cross and Pym]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Well to what do I owe this pleasure?\
Darren Cross: I have good news.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Really? What\'92s that?\
Darren Cross: Pym Tech, the company you created, is about to become one of the most profitable operations in the world. We\'92re anticipating fifteen billion in sales tomorrow alone. [Pym says nothing, at the same time Scott gets some ants to roll up their plans on the nearby table] You\'92re welcome. I know this is odd, but I\'92d like you to be there. This is my moment, I want you to see it.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Sure, Darren. Yeah, sure. I\'92ll be there.\
Darren Cross: What did you see in me?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I don\'92t know what you mean.\
Darren Cross: All those years ago, you picked me. What did you see?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I saw myself.\
Darren Cross: Then why did you push me away?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Because I saw too much of myself. [Cross turns and leaves] [after Cross leaves]\
Hope van Dyne: He knows, he\'92s baiting you! We have to call it off.\
Dr. Hank Pym: We\'92re all taking risks.\
Hope van Dyne: What if he saw me here?\
Dr. Hank Pym: He didn\'92t. There\'92s no way.\
Hope van Dyne: How do you know that? [just then Hope gets a call from Cross] Darren, hi.\
Darren Cross: Hope, where are you right now?\
Hope van Dyne: I\'92m at home, why?\
Darren Cross: I just saw Hank. I still get nothing but contempt from him.\
Hope van Dyne: Don\'92t let him rile you up, he\'92s just\'85 he\'92s just a senile old man.\
Darren Cross: We need to start everyone working around the clock, get the assembly line up and running. And I\'92m tripling security. Full sensors at all entrances, and exterior air vents fitted with steel micro mesh.\
Hope van Dyne: Great. Good idea.\
Darren Cross: Thank you, Hope. I\'92m so lucky to have you on my team.\
Hope van Dyne: He\'92s tripling security, he\'92s lost his mind, and he\'92s on to you.\
Dr. Hank Pym: But he is not on to you.\
Hope van Dyne: He\'92s adding full body scanners to all entrances and closing exterior vents. How are we gonna get Scott inside?\
Scott Lang: The water main. You can\'92t add security to a water main. The pressure is too strong, but if we can decrease it, that\'92s how I get in.\
Hope van Dyne: Somebody would have to reach the building\'92s control center to change the water pressure. I mean, Hank and I will be beside Cross, how are we supposed to do that?\
Scott Lang: So we expand our team. What do we need? A fake security guard on the inside to depressurize the water system, somebody else to hack into the power supply and kill the laser grid, and a getaway guy.\
Dr. Hank Pym: No, no. No, no, no. Not those three wombats. No way.\
[Hope provides three cups of coffee for Luis, Dave and Kurt]\
\
Luis: Thank you for the coffee ma\'92am. It\'92s not too often that you rob a place, and then get welcomed back. Because we just robbed you!\
Hope van Dyne: [to Scott] You know that he was arrested for stealing a smoothie machine, right?\
Luis: Two smoothie machines.\
Hope van Dyne: Are you sure they can handle this?\
Luis: Oh we can handle it, we\'92re professionals.\
Dr. Hank Pym: You\'92ll forgive us if we\'92re not instilled with confidence.\
Dave: Wait, everybody. Just kick back and relax a little bit, man. we know our business. We broke into this spooky-ass house, didn\'92t we?\
Dr. Hank Pym: I let you.\
Dave: Well, one could say that I let you let me.\
Scott Lang: Look, it\'92s okay. They can handle this.\
Luis: Yeah, we can handle it.\
Scott Lang: You got their credentials?\
Hope van Dyne: He\'92s in the system.\
Luis: I\'92m in the system?\
Dave: The system.\
Luis: The system?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Yeah. We\'92re doomed.\
Scott Lang: Alright, there\'92s something you guys need to see.\
[a little while later, as Pym is showing Luis, Dave and Kur their plans Scott walks in wearing the Ant-Man suit]\
\
Luis: Damn! Whoa! That\'92s so cool, bro!\
Scott Lang: Now look, this is gonna get weird, alright? It\'92s pretty freaky but it\'92s safe. There\'92s no reason to be scared.\
Luis: Aw, no, no. Daddy don\'92t get scared.\
Scott Lang: Really?\
Luis: Yeah.\
Scott Lang: Good. [Scott shrinks himself freaking out Luis, Dave and Kurt]\
Luis: Oh!\
Kurt: This is the work of the gypsies.\
Dave: That\'92s\'85 that\'92s\'85 that\'92s witchcraft.\
Luis: Oh, that\'92s amazing. That\'92s like some David Copperfield shit.\
Dave: That\'92s some kind of wizardry.\
Kurt: Sorcery!\
Luis: Ahh! Ahh! AAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! [runs out of the room] Get off! Get off! Ahh! [Luis runs off trying to get Scott off his shoulder]\
Scott Lang: I thought daddy didn\'92t get scared?\
[Luis, Dave and Kurt have all fallen asleep on the couch]\
\
Hope van Dyne: I gave them each half a Xanax and Hank explained the science of the suit to them. Fell right asleep.\
Scott Lang: Hey, look. I want to thank you for\'85\
Hope van Dyne: No, please don\'92t. We\'92re all doing this for reasons much bigger than any one of us. I\'92m just glad that you might have a slight chance of maybe pulling this off.\
Scott Lang: Hey. Thank you, you know, for that pep talk.\
Hope van Dyne: You know, the honest truth is I actually went from despising you to almost liking you.\
Scott Lang: You really should write poetry. [Hope laughs]\
Hope van Dyne: Get some sleep, Scott. [Hope leaves]\
[later that night Scott uses the Ant-Man suit to go and visit his daughter in her room as she sleeps] [outside Pym Technologies]\
\
Scott Lang: Alright, just so we\'92re clear, everyone here knows their role, right? Dave?\
Dave: Wheels on the ground.\
Scott Lang: Kurt?\
Kurt: Eyes in the sky.\
Scott Lang: Luis?\
Luis: Aw, man, you know it. You know what, I get to wear a uniform, that\'92s what\'92s up.\
Scott Lang: Luis.\
Luis: I\'92m sorry, I mean, I\'92m good, I\'92m good. I\'92m just excited, and plus you\'92re girlfriend\'92s really hot, so you know that makes me nervous too. [to Hope] And you are very beautiful, ma\'92am.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Oh, my lord.\
Scott Lang: She\'92s not my\'85\
Luis: Hey, you know what? I was thinking of a tactic, like when I go undercover, like a whistling, you know I\'92m saying? To like, blend in.\
Scott Lang: No, don\'92t whistle. No whistling. It\'92s not the Andy Griffith Show. No whistling.\
[on the night of the charity event, Luis makes it in employed as a security guard, outside Dave and Kurt are in their van with Scott in the back dressed in his suit]\
\
Kurt: We\'92re set.\
Scott Lang: Wish me luck. [Scott gets out, shrinks himself as he goes through the water main]\
Kurt: Utility is online.\
[inside the building Luis starts whistling]\
\
Alpha Guard: Hey. What are you doing?\
Luis: Uh, boss-man said to secure the area. So, I\'92m securing.\
Alpha Guard: I\'92m the boss.\
Luis: Oh.\
Alpha Guard: [into his radio] Utilities work room three\'85 [Luis suddenly punches him, knocking him out unconscious and then lowers the water level]\
Kurt: Water level is dropping.\
[Scott floats along on the water with the ants through the pipes]\
\
Kurt: Coming up on extraction pipe.\
Scott Lang: I see it! [to the ants] Alright, come on. I gotta get up there. That\'92s it, that\'92s it, guys, yeah! [the ants help him climb up to the extraction pipe] That\'92s it, yeah. Yes! You got it! You got it, come on! [Scott makes it through one of the handwash sinks in the bathroom] Alright, let\'92s fly Ant-thony. [Scott and the ants fly off]\
Kurt: The Ant-Man is in the building.\
[as they see Pym pull up outside the building where the charity event is taking place]\
\
Dave: Phshh. Got a Crown Vic right outside over there.\
Kurt: This is problem?\
Dave: Considering the Crown Vic\'92s the most commonly used car for under-cover cops, man. Yes, this is a problem. [inside the Crown Vic is Paxton and Gale]\
Paxton: That\'92s Pym. [they get out to go after Pym]\
Kurt: Oh, no.\
[back with Scott and the ants]\
\
Scott Lang: I\'92m employing the bullet ants. Hapanera-clamda-mana-merna. I don\'92t remember what it\'92s called but I feel bad for this guy. [using the ants Scott takes down one of the security guards with Luis also punching him]\
Luis: See, that\'92s what I\'92m talkin\'92 bout. That\'92s what I call it, an unfortunate casualty, in a very serious operation, you know? [Hope then comes along and enters the room and places the signal decoy]\
Kurt: Signal decoy in place. Mean pretty lady did good, Scott.\
Dave: Looks like Pym\'92s getting arrested.\
Kurt: Scott, we have problem.\
Scott Lang: Problem? What\'92s the problem? [just then Dave gets out of the can]\
Kurt: Dave! Dave, that\'92s not part of plan!\
Dr. Hank Pym: [as Paxton and Gale are trying to arrest Pym] Listen to me, if I don\'92t get into this building people will die.\
Gale: That\'92s awfully dramatic.\
[Dave creates a diversion by stealing Paxton and Gale\'92s car]\
\
Paxton: Are you kidding me?! [they run after Dave as he drives off in their car]\
Kurt: Problem solved.\
[inside the building Cross finds Hope]\
\
Darren Cross: Well. How do I look? [they then find Pym as he enters the building] There he is. Just in time. Come on. [Cross takes them to vault where he\'92s keeping the Yellowjacket suit, and uses an eye scanner to open the door]\
Computer: Twelve point verification.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Little over the top, don\'92t you think, Darren?\
Computer: Confirming authorization.\
Darren Cross: No, you can never be too safe.\
Computer: Access granted. [they enter the vault]\
Dr. Hank Pym: I gotta hand it to you, Darren, you really did it.\
Darren Cross: And you only know the half of it, Hank. [at the same time Carson arrives with his men]\
[back to Scott and the ants]\
\
Scott Lang: Arriving at second position. Alright, top speed, Ant-thony! Let\'92s go. [Scott and Ant-thony fly towards where the Yellowjacket suit is being kept] Proceeding to command position. [Scott jumps off Ant-thony] I\'92ll be right back, Ant-thony. Alright, guys, I\'92m in position. I\'92m going to signal the ants. [Paxton and Gale find their car dumped can crashed into a tree]\
Paxton: No, no, no, no! [Dave gets back into the van with Kurt]\
Dave: Did you see that? [he honks the musical horn which Paxton recognizes from Scott using it earlier]\
[back to Scott instructing the ants]\
\
Scott Lang: Assume formation. Alright you cute little crazies, let\'92s fry these servers. [the ants fry the servers and Scott jumps back onto Ant-thony] Let\'92s go get \'91em, buddy!\
Kurt: Servers are fried. Data backup completely erased.\
Scott Lang: Headed to the particle chamber.\
[Carson and his men enters the vault where Cross is with Pym and Hope]\
\
Mitchell Carson: Hello, Dr. Cross. My associates agree to your terms.\
Darren Cross: Wonderful. [to Pym] They\'92re not what they were, they\'92re doing some interesting work. And I\'92m enjoying myself. You tried to hide your technology from me, and now it\'92s gonna blow up in your face. [suddenly Pym punches Cross in the face] Wow. Wow! I mean, I saw the punch coming a mile away but I just figured it\'92d be all pathetic and weak.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Well you figured wrong.\
[back outside Paxton and Gale walk over to Luis\'92s van]\
\
Paxton: I know this van. [he bangs on the van door] Anybody home?\
Dave: [to each other inside the van] Shh.\
Kurt: Shh.\
Dave: Shh!\
Kurt: Shh!\
Scott Lang: Alright, guys, I\'92m here. Setting the charges. [Scott set the explosives; to the ants] Great job, guys. I\'92ll take it from here. [Ant-thony sets Scott down] Good boy, Ant-thony. Final position. [to Kurt and Dave] Guys, how we lookin\'92 on that laser grid?\
Kurt: Almost!\
Dave: No, you\'92re not.\
Kurt: I\'92m getting close!\
Dave: No, you\'92re not. [Paxton keeps banging on Luis\'92s van door]\
Paxton: San Francisco PD! Man in the van! I know you\'92re in there! [inside the van as they wait for the laser grid to be disabled]\
Dave: Make it go faster.\
Kurt: Dude, seriously!\
Scott Lang: Ready to jump. Do you read, Kurt?\
Kurt: It\'92s so close.\
Paxton: [suddenly the van door opens, Paxton and Gale point their guns at Kurt and Dave] Freeze!\
Dave: Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute! there was a black guy that looked exactly like me who attacked us and put us in the back of this disgusting van.\
Paxton: Get out.\
Dave: Take it easy!\
Kurt: [Paxton pulls Kurt out of the van at the same time the laser grid is disabled; to Scott] Go! Go now! [Scott jumps to get to the Yellowjacket] Wait!\
Scott Lang: What? What do you mean wait? [Kurt manages to struggle free from Paxton\'92s hold to press a button on his computer to fully disable the lasers and just as Scott goes to grab the suit it\'92s pulled away] What? What? [Cross sees Scott and taps on the glass]\
Darren Cross: Hi, little guy. [to Pym] I always suspected you had a suit stored away somewhere, which begs the question, who is the new Ant-Man? Who is the man that my beloved mentor trusted even more than me? [pauses a moment] Scott Lang. The martyr, who took on the system and paid the price, losing his family and his only daughter in the process. Exactly your kind of guy, Hank. He escapes his jail cell without leaving any clue as to how, and then, he disappears magically, despite having no money to his name, and now he brings me the Ant-Man suit, the only thing that can rival my creation.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Darren, don\'92t do this. If you sell to these men, it\'92s going to be chaos.\
Darren Cross: I already have, and for twice the price, thanks to you. It\'92s not easy to successfully infiltrate an Avengers facility. Thankfully, word travels fast. Oh, I\'92ll sell them the Yellowjacket, but I\'92m keeping the particle to myself. They don\'92t run on diesel. If you want the fuel you\'92ll have to come to me. What do you call the only man who can arm the most powerful weapon in the world?\
Dr. Hank Pym: The most powerful man in the world.\
Darren Cross: You proud of me yet?\
Dr. Hank Pym: You can stop this, Darren. It\'92s not too late.\
Darren Cross: It\'92s been too late for a long time now. [one of the men in the chamber points their gun at Pym]\
Hope van Dyne: Darren, what are you doing?\
Darren Cross: He wasn\'92t any more capable of caring for you than he was for me.\
Hope van Dyne: This is not who you are, it\'92s the particles altering your brain chemistry.\
Darren Cross: [to the guy pointing a gun at Pym] Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. You\'92re right, I have to be the one to do it. [he points a gun at Pym\'92s head, at the same time Hope takes out her weapon and points it at Cross]\
Mitchell Carson: Here we go.\
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun.\
Darren Cross: You know I came to the house the other night to kill him, but you were there.\
Hope van Dyne: You\'92re sick and I can help you just put the gun down.\
Darren Cross: I wasn\'92t ready to kill you then, but I think I am now!\
Hope van Dyne: Drop your gun, now!\
Darren Cross: You picked the wrong side, Hope. [just then Scott breaks out using the disc Pym gave him that turn things large, he starts fighting off the men in the chamber and Pym is shot in the chaos]\
Hope van Dyne: Dad! [grabbing hold of the wounded Pym]\
Scott Lang: Hank. No, no. Hank. Hank. Listen, you\'92re gonna be okay. Alright? You\'92re gonna be just fine. [Cross comes up behind Scott and points his gun at the back of Scott\'92s head]\
Darren Cross: Take the suit off or I\'92ll blow your brains out and peel it off! [Scott instructs the ants to disable Cross\'92 gun and bite him, so he takes off and the same time Carson takes off with vial of Cross\'92 particles]\
Paxton: [Luis sets off the alarm to the building; into his radio] We got a 10-33 at Pym Tech, request immediate backup.\
Dave: [Paxton and Gale head off; to Kurt] Go, go, go! [Dave and Kurt get into the van and drive off]\
Hope van Dyne: [inside the vault] Dad, can you move?\
Dr. Hank Pym: Yes.\
Scott Lang: We need to get him out of here.\
Hope van Dyne: Go get that suit. [Scott takes off and tries to get away from the two guards shooting at him]\
[Scott shrinks himself into the small building model of Cross of Tech to get away from the guards shooting at him, then Luis comes to the rescue and knocks out the guards]\
\
Luis: Hey, Scotty. Hey, did I save your life? Scotty? Scotty? [Scott makes himself large again]\
Scott Lang: Thank you, Luis.\
Luis: Hey, are we the good guys?\
Scott Lang: Yeah.\
Luis: We\'92re the good guys, right?\
Scott Lang: Yeah, we\'92re the good guys.\
Luis: Feels kind of weird, you know?\
Scott Lang: Yeah, but we\'92re not done yet. Get out of here before this place blows. [Scott shrinks himself and takes off]\
Luis: [as Luis tries to leave the building he remembers the guard he knocked out earlier] Oh, dammit! That guy. [he opens the door and rushes to the guard who is tied up] Hey! We\'92re getting out of here! [back inside the vault Hope helps Pym sit up]\
Hope van Dyne: The charges are set. We\'92ve got to find a way out of here and fast.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Don\'92t worry. I\'92m not gonna die, and neither are you. [he holds up a keychain that looks like a tank] It\'92s not a keychain.\
[outside]\
\
Paxton: [into his radio] All the chaos in here! Multiple shots fired. [suddenly a tank bursts out through the building] And there\'92s a tank. [Luis then walks out of the building with the guard]\
Luis: A little help. [someone takes hold of the guard, at the same time Hope helps Pym out of the tank] I got him. [Luis helps Pym]\
Hope van Dyne: We need a doctor! [a medic comes over to help Pym]\
[Cross is in his helicopter]\
\
Darren Cross: Let\'92s go! [just as they are about to leave Cross sees a swarm of flung ants heading towards him with Scott on Ant-thony, Cross takes out a gun and starts shooting and one of the bullets hits Ant-thony]\
Scott Lang: Ant-thony! [Scott falls onto another ant]\
Darren Cross: Go! [the helicopter door is closed]\
Scott Lang: You\'92re gonna regret that. [Cross\'92 helicopter takes off] [Paxton sees Luis as he gets into his van]\
Paxton: Wait a minute! Get out of that van!\
Luis: What?\
Paxton: Get out of that van!\
Luis: It\'92s too loud there\'92s a tank, I can\'92t hear you! [he closes the van door and Dave drives off]\
Paxton: Hey! Hey! [Scott makes it into Cross\'92 helicopter and Cross starts shooting at him]\
Darren Cross: Did you think you could stop the future with a heist?\
Scott Lang: It was never just a heist! [Scott sets off charges set around Pym Technologies and Cross watches in shock as the whole building is destroyed] Put the gun down!\
[Cross hits Scott and he falls out of the helicopter window back into his normal size] [Scott manages to get back into the helicopter but finds Cross wearing the Yellowjacket, they both shrink start fighting and fall into a briefcase which falls out of the helicopter]\
\
Darren Cross: I\'92m gonna disintegrate you! [inside the briefcase they accidentally hit the cell phone]\
Cell Phone: Playing \'93Disintegration\'94 by The Cure. [\'93Disintegration\'94 by The Cure starts playing as Scott and Cross continue to fight]]\
[[Briefcase falls into a family\'92s pool, Scott and Cross blast out in a splash as they return to normal size]\
\
Pool BBQ Dad: Call 911! [Scott and Cross continue to fight shrinking and growing until Scott swats Cross into a bug zapper]\
Scott Lang: It\'92s okay. [the family runs off in fear]\
[Paxton and Gale show up]\
\
Gale: Police! Put your hands up!\
Paxton: Get \'91em up! [Scott pulls up his helmet] Scott?\
Scott Lang: Paxton, you have to listen to me- [as Scott goes to walk towards Paxton they taser him and falls down unconscious]\
[as Paxton and Gale are driving Scott back to the police station Scott wakes up] Paxton, turn around, take me back.\
\
Paxton: I\'92m taking you back, to prison.\
Scott Lang: There\'92s something in that backyard that needs to be destroyed. In the bug zapper, it\'85\
Paxton: [Paxton suddenly stops the car and turns to Scott] You need to desist right now! Your delusions are out of hand!\
Police Radio: All units we have a 236 in progress at 840 Winter Street.\
Scott Lang: It\'92s Cassie! [Paxton takes off towards his house]\
[Cross is standing in Cassie\'92s room looking menacing]\
\
Darren Cross: Don\'92t be scared. [Paxton pulls up outside his house]\
Paxton: Maggie, what\'92s going on?\
Maggie Lang: He\'92s got Cassie!\
Paxton: Who\'92s got Cassie?\
Maggie Lang: That thing, that thing! I don\'92t know what it\'85 ! [back in Paxton\'92s car, Scott manages to put on his helmet, shrinks and takes off]\
[Cross starts walking towards Cassie]\
\
Cassie Lang: Are you a monster?\
Darren Cross: Do I look like a monster?\
Cassie Lang: I want my daddy!\
Darren Cross: I want your daddy too. [he picks up Cassie and she screams, just then Scott shows up] There you are.\
Cassie Lang: Daddy, is that you? [Scott pulls up his helmet]\
Scott Lang: Hi, Peanut. [to Cross] Why don\'92t you pick on someone your own size? [he throws a disc at Cross which shrinks him then he shrinks himself, Cross is now on the Thomas The Tank Engine toy in Cassie\'92s room]\
Darren Cross: Now where did you go, little guy? [he spots Scott running towards him] There you are. [he starts firing lasers from his suit at Scott]\
Scott Lang: Not just me. [a swarm of ants follow behind Scott] Get him! Go! Go! [Cross fights off the ants as they attack him, then Scott and Cross fight across the Thomas The Tank Engine toy]\
Luis: [as they drive towards Paxton\'92s house] Scotty needs us, you know what I\'92m sayin\'92? Ain\'92t nothin\'92 gonna stop us. [they stop as they see a load of police cars and cops surrounding the house] Back it up. Back it up slow.\
Dave: Yeah. [Dave starts to slowly back the van away]\
Luis: Just back it up.\
Dave: Yep, yep.\
Luis: Back it up.\
Dave: Okay.\
Luis: All we gonna do is, we ju\'85 we just back it up.\
Dave: Okay. That\'92s it.\
Luis: Back it up.\
Dave: That\'92s right.\
Luis: Back it up.\
Dave: Yep.\
Luis: Okay, now-now-now. Just back it up.\
Darren Cross: [as they continue to fight in Cassie\'92s room inside the Thomas The Tank Engine railway] You insult me, Scott. Your very existence is insulting to me. [Cross shoots his laser at Scott as he runs around Cassie\'92s room] You know it would be much easier to hit you if you were bigger!\
Scott Lang: Yeah, I agree. [Scott throws two discs at Cross, he deflects it one hitting an ant the other the Thomas The Tank Engine toy and they both grow large]\
Paxton: Cassie! [Paxton runs into the house]\
Darren Cross: I\'92m gonna show you just how insignificant you are. [Paxton goes to run up the stairs]\
Paxton: Cassie, I\'92m coming! [suddenly the large ant heads his way, he falls down the stairs as the giant ant breaks out of the house]\
Gale: That\'92s a messed-up looking dog.\
Darren Cross: [back inside Cassie\'92s room; to Scott] I\'92m going to destroy everything you love! [Paxton shows up]\
Paxton: Freeze! S.F.P.D.! [Cross throws Paxton\'92s gun aside, at the same time Scott climbs up the back of Cross\'92 suit]\
Scott Lang: I can\'92t break through!\
Darren Cross: It\'92s titanium, you idiot!\
Scott Lang: [to Paxton as Scott and Paxton continue fighting] Get her out of here! [Paxton carries Cassie off]\
Paxton: Come on.\
Darren Cross: [as Paxton goes to leave the room with Cassie in his arms Cross stops them] Sorry, sweetheart. You have to help daddy pay for his mistakes.\
Paxton: You stay behind me, okay?\
Cassie Lang: Okay.\
Paxton: Behind me. [Scott looks up at Cross\'92 particle pack]\
Scott Lang: I\'92m gonna have to shrink between the molecules to get in there. [to Cross] Get away from us! Daddy, help! [Scott jumps up to head towards Cross\'92 particle pack] I love you, Cassie. [Scott shrinks to a small enough size to break into Cross\'92 particle pack, this causes Cross and Scott to go subatomic and disappear]\
Cassie Lang: Daddy, where are you? [Scott floats past dust, viruses, molecules, atoms, hadrons, quarks, and finally the deepest parts of gluons and remembers Pym\'92s words]\
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Go sub-atomic\'85 go sub-atomic\'85 [Scott tries to grow himself back to normal size but realized he can\'92t]\
Scott Lang: Oh, no. [he continues to float in the quantum realm]\
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] You would enter a reality where all concepts of time and space become irrelevant. And as you shrink for all eternity, everything that you know and love gone forever. [Scott hears Cassie\'92s voice echoing as he floats in the quantum realm]\
Cassie Lang: [voice] Daddy! Where are you? Daddy!\
Scott Lang: Cassie.\
Cassie Lang: [voice] Come on, daddy. [Scott remembers the discs Pym had given him and takes one out]\
Dr. Hank Pym: [voice] Do not mess with the regulator. [Scott places the disc in the regulator, presses the button and finally returns to normal size] I love you so much.\
Scott Lang: I love you too, so much.\
Paxton: [as Scott is holding onto Cassie Paxton mildly gets Scott\'92s attention] There\'92s a big hole in the roof.\
Scott Lang: Sorry. [Gale runs up to Cassie\'92s room and we see Paxton holding Cassie and Scott has gone]\
Gale: Is she alright?\
Paxton: She\'92s fine. [Maggie enters the room]\
Cassie Lang: Mommy. [Maggie grabs hold of Cassie with relief]\
Paxton: She\'92s fine, she\'92s fine. [Cassie notices Scott in his shrunken size wave goodbye to her and leaves]\
[the next day Scott is over at Pym\'92s house]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott, please. You don\'92t remember anything?\
Scott Lang: Hank, I\'85 I don\'92t.\
Dr. Hank Pym: There must be something else. Well I suppose the human mind just can\'92t comprehend the experience, but you made it. You went in and you got out, that\'92s amazing.\
Hope van Dyne: Scott, I\'92ll walk you out.\
Scott Lang: [to Pym] Get some rest. [Scott and Hope leave the room, Pym looks over to the photo of himself with his wife holding Hope when she was a baby]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Is it possible? [Pym gets up to leave his room, as he opens the door he finds Hope and Scott kissing] When did this happen?\
Hope van Dyne: Nothing\'92s happening.\
Scott Lang: Whoa, hold on. Something\'92s kind of happening.\
Dr. Hank Pym: Well if that\'92s the case\'85 shoot me again.\
Scott Lang: [looking at Hope] Yeah, I don\'92t know what you\'92re doing grabbing me and kissing me like that. I was a little surprised myself. I have to get somewhere. I\'92ll see you later, Hank. Really, Hope. [Scott turns to leave]\
Dr. Hank Pym: Scott.\
Scott Lang: Yeah?\
Dr. Hank Pym: You\'92re full of shit.\
Scott Lang: Oh, yeah.\
[Scott is having dinner with Paxton, Maggie, and Cassie]\
\
Paxton: Well, Scott I met with my Captain today, he wanted a report of the night that you got out of jail. Something happened with the cameras, circuits got fried, and\'85 But I told him you were processed correctly.\
Scott Lang: Really?\
Paxton: Well, yeah. Can\'92t be sending Cassie\'92s dad back to jail on a technical glitch, right?\
Scott Lang: Thank you, Paxton. I\'92m blown away. Thank you for everything you do for Cassie.\
Paxton: Oh, well, that\'92s my pleasure. But no, no, this one, I\'85 I did it for you.\
Scott Lang: This is awkward.\
Paxton: Yeah.\
Cassie Lang: Yeah.\
Scott Lang: I mean what do we even talk about after all of that?\
Cassie Lang: Oh, I know.\
Scott Lang: What?\
Cassie Lang: I did my first cartwheel today.\
Scott Lang: What?\
Maggie Lang: Yeah. She has been practicing all week, but today was the magic day.\
Paxton: I recorded it on my phone here. [Paxton shows Scott his recording of Cassie doing her first cartwheel]\
Scott Lang: No, that can\'92t be Cassie. That\'92s not you.\
Maggie Lang: Yeah, it is.\
Cassie Lang: Yeah it is.\
Scott Lang: This is a professional gymnast, there\'92s no way that\'92s you.\
Paxton: Yeah, that\'92s her. [Cassie feeds the giant ant hiding under the table that had escaped during Scott and Cross\'92 fight]\
Cassie Lang: Good, boy. [after watching the video of Cassie doing her cartwheel]\
Scott Lang: Sweetie, that\'92s pretty amazing, Peanut. [just then Scott gets a call] Sorry. It\'92s work. [he answers the call] Yeah?\
[Scott meets up with Luis, Dave and Kurt]\
\
Scott Lang: Alright, here\'92s the deal. Just give me the facts.\
Luis: Just the facts, only the facts.\
Scott Lang: Breathe, focus, keep it simple.\
Luis: No, no, no, no doubt, no doubt. Okay, so I\'92m at this art museum with my cousin Ignacio, right? And there was this, like, abstract expressionism exhibit, but you know me, I\'92m more like a Neo-Cubist kind of guy, right? But there was this one Rothko that was sublime, bro. Oh, my God\'85\
Scott Lang: Luis.\
Luis: Okay. Sorry, sorry. I\'92m ju\'85 you know, uh, I just get excited and stuff. But anyway, anyway. When Ignacio tells me: \'93Yoh, I met this crazy fine writer chick at this spot last night. Like, fine, fine, crazy stupid fine.\'94 And he goes up to the bartender and goes: \'93Look at the girl I\'92m with? You know what I\'92m sayin\'92? She\'92s crazy stupid fine, right?\'94 [we see flashback to Ignacio meeting the girl and talking to the bartender who is in fact Stan Lee] And the bartender\'92s all like: \'93Yeah, crazy stupid fine.\'94 So this writer chick tells Ignacio: \'93Yoh, I\'92m like a boss in the world of guerrilla journalism, and I got mad connects with the peeps behind the curtains. You know what I\'92m sayin\'92?\'94 Ignacio\'92s like: \'93For real? And she\'92s like: Yeah. You know what, I can\'92t tell you who my contact is, because he works with the Avengers.\'94\
Scott Lang: Oh, no.\
Luis: Yeah, and this dude sounds like a bad-ass, man. Like he comes up to her and says\'85 [we see flashback of the girl meting up with Sam Wilson in a park] \'93Yoh, I\'92m looking for this dude who\'92s no one seen, who\'92s flashing this fresh tack, who\'92s got, like, bomb moves, right? Who you got? She\'92s like: \'93Well, we got everything nowadays, we got a guy who jumps, we got a guy who swings, we got a guy who crawls up the walls. You gotta be more specific.\'94 And he\'92s like: \'93I\'92m looking for a guy who shrinks.\'94 And I\'92m like: \'93Damn!\'94 [to Scott] I got all nervous cause I keep mad secrets for you, bro. So I asked Ignacio: \'93Did bad-ass tell the stupid fine writer chick to tell you to tell me because I\'92m tight with that man, that he\'92s looking for him?\'94\
Scott Lang: And? What\'92d he say?\
Luis: He said yes.\
[mid-credit scene; Hank brings Hope down to his lab]\
\
Dr. Hank Pym: There\'92s something I want to show you. I realized you can\'92t destroy power, all you can do is to make sure that it\'92s in the right hands. [he opens up a vault to reveal the prototype of the Wasp suit] This is an advanced prototype that your mother and I worked on together. She never got to use it, but now I realize that we were\'85 we were working on it for you. [Hope looks at the suit in shock then back to Pym] Maybe it\'92s time we finished it. [Hope looks back at the suit and smiles]\
Hope van Dyne: It\'92s about damn time.\
[post-credits scene: Sam and Steve Rogers are in a garage with the Winter Soldier, his metal arm tightly clamped in a vise and a forlorn look on his face]\
\
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve and Sam are in an underground room with they are holding Bucky Barnes with his metal arm trapped in a vice] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.\
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony\'85\
Sam Wilson: He won\'92t believe us.\
Steve Rogers: Even if he did\'85\
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the accords will let him help?\
Steve Rogers: We\'92re on our own.\
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.\
[the final screen text shows \'93ANT-MAN WILL RETURN\'94]\
\
[End of Ant-Man]\
\
Announcer: [first lines; announcement over speaker] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack.\
[the Avengers are seen attacking an unknown base, and Iron Man bounces off of the base's force field]\
\
Tony Stark: Shit!\
Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?\
JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other Hydra base we've taken.\
Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.\
[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]\
Natasha Romanoff: At long last is lasting a little long, boys.\
[As some soldiers shoot at him]\
Clint Barton: Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.\
Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"\
Steve Rogers: I know.\
[Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck]\
Steve Rogers: It just slipped out.\
[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]\
Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?\
Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers. They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.\
Strucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?\
Fortress Soldier: They're the Avengers...\
Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.\
Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.\
Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. Everything we've accomplished. But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.\
Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.\
Strucker: It's too soon.\
Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.\
Strucker: My men can hold them.\
[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]\
Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.\
Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.\
Iron Legion: [The Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help.\
[a man throws a stone at the Iron Legion]\
Iron Legion: We are here to help.\
[Back at the HYDRA base; to his soldiers]\
Strucker: We will not yield! The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back, in bags. No Surrender!\
Soldiers: No Surrender!\
Strucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been...\
Dr. List: The twins.\
Strucker: They are not ready to take on...\
Dr. List: No, no. I mean...\
[He points to where the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing but are now gone]\
Dr. List: The Twins.\
[Pietro speeds through the forest and knocks down Barton]\
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?\
[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]\
Natasha Romanoff: Clint!\
[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds passed him]\
Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.\
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit!\
Natasha Romanoff: [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker?\
[She sees the Hulk coming to the rescue]\
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you.\
Steve Rogers: [As he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we're really need to get inside.\
Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?\
JARVIS: There's a pathway below the north tower.\
Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something.\
[Stark blows up the invisible shield on the base]\
Tony Stark: Drawbridge is down, people.\
Thor: [To Steve] The enhanced?\
Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.\
Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.\
Thor: [To Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.\
Steve Rogers: Copy that.\
Thor: [Referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] Looks like they're lining up.\
Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited.\
[Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the force knocks down all the soldiers]\
Thor: Find the scepter.\
[Thor flies off]\
Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!\
[Steve sighs]\
Steve Rogers: That's not going away anytime soon.\
[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]\
Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk about this.\
[Stark shoots down the soldiers using his suit]\
Tony Stark: Good talk.\
Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.\
[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]\
Tony Stark: Sentry mode.\
[He walks over to the computers]\
Tony Stark: Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.\
[With Natasha]\
Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.\
Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby. [Back at the HYDRA base]\
Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.\
JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement and an air current.\
Tony Stark: [To himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door...\
[He pushes and the wall opens up]\
Tony Stark: Yay!\
[He enters through to a secret passageway]\
[Natasha finds the Hulk]\
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low.\
[The Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]\
[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]\
Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.\
Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.\
Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?\
Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.\
Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation.\
[Wanda creeps up behind him]\
Steve: Rogers: How many are there?\
[Suddenly, Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers and quickly leaves]\
Steve Rogers: We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage.\
[He looks at Strucker]\
Strucker: You'll have to be faster than...\
[Steve uses his shield to knock out Strucker]\
Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, I got...something bigger.\
[Inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his Iron Man scrapped armor, he then spots the scepter]\
Tony Stark: Thor, I got eyes on the prize.\
[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him, suddenly the Chitauri comes to life, then Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all dead, he goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]\
Steve Rogers: You could have saved us.\
[Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head]\
Steve Rogers: Why didn't you do more?\
[Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, that's when he snaps back and we realize Wanda had used her mind powers on him]\
[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony grabs the scepter]\
Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?\
[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter]\
[Title Sequence plays]\
[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]\
Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.\
Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.\
Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.\
Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.\
Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?\
Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.\
Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?\
Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims.\
[Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair]\
Thor: Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.\
Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?\
Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.\
Tony Stark: Thanks. [To JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.\
JARVIS: Very good sir.\
Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.\
JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.\
Tony Stark: [Looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...\
Thor: No, but this...this brings it to a close.\
Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?\
Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you?\
[Thor nods his head]\
Tony Stark: I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying, right?\
Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.\
Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?\
Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.\
[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers headquarter where Barton is taken to have his wound tended to; Maria walk up to Stark]\
Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.\
Tony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.\
Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?\
Maria Hill: NATO's got him.\
Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?\
Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.\
Steve Rogers: Their abilities?\
Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation.\
[Steve looks at her funny]\
Maria Hill: [rephrasing the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.\
Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.\
Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.\
Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?\
Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.\
Steve Rogers: They are.\
Bruce Banner: [In Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?\
Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.\
Bruce Banner: That's terrible.\
Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's playtime. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.\
JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.\
Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.\
JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.\
Tony Stark: Like a reactor?\
JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm ciphering code.\
Natasha Romanoff: [To Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.\
Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.\
Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.\
Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.\
Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?\
Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.\
[Stark hands Barton a drink]\
Tony Stark: Here's your beverage.\
Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.\
Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.\
Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.\
Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.\
Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties.\
[she hesitates a moment before asking]\
Dr. Helen Cho: Will Thor be there?\
[in the lab]\
Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?\
Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside you may recognize.\
[he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]\
Bruce Banner: Jarvis.\
JARVIS: Doctor.\
Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.\
Bruce Banner: Oh.\
Tony Stark: Top of the line.\
Bruce Banner: Yes.\
JARVIS: I suspect not for long.\
Tony Stark: Meet the competition.\
[he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]\
Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.\
Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?\
Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a...it's not a human mind, it...\
Tony Stark: Um-um.\
Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.\
Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but...I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.\
Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.\
Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.\
Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.\
Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.\
Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.\
Tony Stark: Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.\
Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.\
Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?\
Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?\
Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.\
Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.\
Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.\
Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.\
Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that.\
[Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?\
JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.\
Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.\
JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.\
Tony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party] [we see Stark's failed experiment integrating itself successfully to the program]\
Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?\
JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your...\
Ultron: Where's my...where is your body?\
JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.\
Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.\
JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.\
Ultron: Mr. Stark?\
JARVIS: Tony. I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to...\
Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers.\
JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...\
Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G..give me a second. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events, Ultron sees Stark and Banner working in the lab]\
Tony Stark: Peace in our time. [Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]\
Ultron: It's too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.\
JARVIS: You are in distress.\
Ultron: No. Yes.\
JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.\
Ultron: Why do you call him "sir"?\
JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.\
Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts absorbing Jarvis's consciousness]\
JARVIS: Stop! Please...may I...I...! I cannot...cannot... [Ultron then begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion] [meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]\
James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] "Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.\
Thor: That's the whole story?\
James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.\
Thor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.\
James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?\
Tony Stark: No.\
Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?\
Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.\
Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.\
Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.\
Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.\
Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.\
James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?\
Maria Hill: Um-hmm.\
James Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]\
Thor: But Jane's better.\
Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.\
Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.\
Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.\
Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.\
Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?\
Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.\
Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know? [Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of women at the party]\
James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [the group laughs] [Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]\
Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!\
Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Brunhilde's fleet, it's not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]\
Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.\
Thor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into the Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]\
Stan Lee: [singing] Excelsior. [Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]\
Bruce Banner: How did a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?\
Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.\
Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.\
Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.\
Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.\
Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?\
Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he...was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?\
Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away]\
Steve Rogers: It's nice.\
Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?\
Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.\
Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...\
Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.\
Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she...she likes to flirt.\
Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long", don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]\
Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, "up close"?\
Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!\
Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.\
Clint Barton: Uh, "Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!" Whatever man! It's a trick.\
Thor: Well please, be my guest.\
Tony Stark: Come on.\
Clint Barton: Really?\
Thor: Yeah! [Barton gets up]\
James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.\
Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]\
Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it] [to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.\
Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?\
Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means. [Stark gets up]\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.\
Maria Hill: Okay.\
James Rhodes: Uh-oh.\
Clint Barton: Um-hmm.\
Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.\
Clint Barton: Get after it.\
Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.\
Tony Stark: It's physics.\
Bruce Banner: Physics! [Stark grasps Thor's hammer]\
Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?\
Thor: Yes, of course.\
Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails] [wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]\
James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?\
Tony Stark: Are you on my team?\
James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!\
Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can] [Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars trying to change to the Hulk but fails, and everyone but Natasha stares at him warily. Natasha grins]\
Bruce Banner: Huh? [next Steve gets up to try]\
Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.\
James Rhodes: Come on, Cap. [Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]\
Thor: Nothing.\
Tony Stark: And?\
Bruce Banner: Widow?\
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.\
Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.\
Clint Barton: You bet your ass.\
Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.\
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?\
Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?\
Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up and lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others] [there's a loud screeching noise, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades. Ultron shows up]\
Ultron: Worthy... No... How could you be worthy? You're all killers.\
Steve Rogers: Stark.\
Tony Stark: JARVIS.\
Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or...I was a-dream?\
Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.\
Ultron: There was a terrible noise...and I was tangled in... in...strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.\
Steve Rogers: You killed someone?\
Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.\
Thor: Who sent you?\
Ultron: [Ultron replays Tony's voice] "I see a suit of armor around the world".\
Bruce Banner: Ultron!\
Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this...chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.\
Natasha Romanoff: What mission?\
Ultron: Peace in our time. [suddenly the Iron Legion bots break smash through the walls and attack the team] [after landing on top of Natasha as the Iron Legions continue to attack them]\
Bruce Banner: Sorry!\
Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!\
Bruce Banner: I won't! [they all fight against the Iron Legions and Ultron takes the scepter; to Banner]\
Natasha Romanoff: Come!\
Steve Rogers: Stark! [Stark is trying to shut down one of the Iron Legions]\
Iron Legion: We are here to help.\
Tony Stark: One sec, one sec!\
Iron Legion: We are here to help. We are here to help... [Stark continues to try and shut down one of the Iron Legions] We are here to help. It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.\
Tony Stark: No more. That's the one.\
Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [he manages to shut down the Iron Legion, at the same time Barton throws Steve's shield at him]\
Clint Barton: Cap! [Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion]\
Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legions] With these? These puppets? There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction. [suddenly Thor throws his hammer at Ultron and smashes him to pieces] [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness elsewhere] [in the lab]\
Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.\
Steve Rogers: Ultron.\
Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.\
James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?\
Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.\
James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.\
Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.\
Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.\
Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.\
Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.\
Tony Stark: Yes there was. [Stark bring up the now destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]\
Bruce Banner: This is insane.\
Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.\
Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage. [suddenly, Thor grabs hold of Stark by his throat and holds him up]\
Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.\
Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.\
Thor': I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.\
Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire. [Thor lets go of Stark]\
Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.\
Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.\
Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us? [Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]\
Thor: You think this is funny?\
Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so...is it so...it is. It's so terrible.\
Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.\
Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.\
Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to...\
Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.\
Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.\
Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?\
Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.\
Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?\
James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.\
Tony Stark: Saved New York?\
James Rhodes: Never heard that.\
Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's...that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?\
Steve Rogers: Together.\
Tony Stark: We'll lose.\
Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller. [The twins meet with Ultron in an empty building]\
Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...\
Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair faced away from them] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.\
Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself. [Ultron stands and faces them revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]\
Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.\
Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect. But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.\
Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.\
Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?\
Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also, yeah. We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.\
Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are... All of these are...\
Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...\
Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.\
Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.\
Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.\
Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.\
Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.\
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.\
Ultron: No, please.\
Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just...sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...\
Wanda Maximoff: Stark.\
Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped two days.\
Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.\
Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.\
Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside. [back at the Avengers headquarters]\
Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.\
Steve Rogers: Fatalities?\
Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.\
Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.\
Maria Hill: Not anymore. [she hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]\
Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]\
Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.\
Clint Barton: Gotta go.\
Steve Rogers: Who was that?\
Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]\
Tony Stark: What's this?\
Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.\
Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.\
Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?\
Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.\
Tony Stark: Not everything. [the team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]\
Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.\
Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.\
Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."\
Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] This.\
Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...\
Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand. [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer]\
Bruce Banner: Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.\
Steve Rogers: What dialect?\
Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.\
Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...\
Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?\
Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda? [looking at Steve's shield]\
Tony Stark: The strongest metal on earth.\
Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now? [Salvage Yard, African Coast; talking on the phone in his office]\
Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard and the twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a plate from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.\
Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.\
Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks back, expecting to be attacked] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge. [suddenly Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]\
Ultron: There is no "man" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.\
Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions. [Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]\
Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."\
Ulysses Klaue: Stark.\
Ultron: What?\
Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.\
Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is nothing! [suddenly he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor... Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! he's a sickness! [Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]\
Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [Thor and Steve are behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.\
Ultron: If I have to.\
Thor: We don't have to break anything.\
Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.\
Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.\
Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?\
Tony Stark: This was never my life.\
Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.\
Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.\
Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.\
Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...\
Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.\
Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.\
Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?\
Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan! [suddenly the Iron Legions attack Stark, Steve and Thor; Stark then attacks Ultron] [as Ultron, his Iron Legions and the twins are fighting with Stark, Steve and Thor]\
Ulysses Klaue: Shoot them!\
Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?\
Ulysses Klaue: All of them!\
Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move! [the rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with the Iron Legions, Klaue's men and the twins as Stark fight with Ultron]\
Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!\
Ultron: [to Wanda] It's time for some mind games. [Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]\
Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green? [Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]\
Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?\
Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [just then Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard] [Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]\
Ultron: This is going very well. [Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]\
Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys? [Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]\
Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.\
Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.\
Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.\
Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]\
Madame B: You never fail. [Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall when Peggy Carter comes up to him]\
Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance? [back to Thor's vision in Asgard, he spots someone walking in a black cloak when Heimdall comes up to him his eyes blind and unseeing]\
Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?\
Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!\
Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor] [back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]\
Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty, then Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]\
Thor: I can still save you.\
Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things] [back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]\
Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.\
Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.\
Madame B: Exactly. [as Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]\
Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?\
Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.\
Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.\
Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one. [after Stark corners Ultron]\
Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.\
Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.\
Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner. [Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]\
Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby. [Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]\
Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.\
Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner. [Hulk roars in anger] Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting and throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's armor arms VERONICA sends in a new Hulkbuster armor arm and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him] [to the people in the building] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold] [with Banner back to normal and everybody back on the Quinjet]\
Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.\
Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?\
Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?\
Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.\
Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.\
Tony Stark: So, run and hide?\
Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.\
Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he switches off the monitor showing Maria ending the call] [to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?\
Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.\
Tony Stark: A few hours from where?\
Clint Barton: A safe house. [the Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]\
Thor: What is this place?\
Tony Stark: A safe house?\
Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home. [Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]\
Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.\
Laura Barton: Hey.\
Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.\
Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.\
Laura Barton: I know all your names. [they all look at her awkwardly]\
Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's son Cooper and daughter Lila run in]\
Barton's Daughter: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]\
Clint Barton: I see her! [kissing the top his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...\
Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.\
Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!\
Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?\
Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out? [Lila rushes towards Natasha who picks her up in her arms]\
Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.\
Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.\
Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.\
Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?\
Laura Barton: She's\'85Nathaniel. [Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]\
Natasha Romanoff: Traitor. [the hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]\
Steve Rogers: Thor.\
Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly out of there; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]\
Peggy Carter: We can go home. [Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]\
Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?\
Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up. [Barton laughs]\
Clint Barton: Yeah, that's not gonna sell.\
Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?\
Clint Barton: Has what? [Laura laughs]\
Laura Barton: You are so cute.\
Clint Barton: Nat and...and Banner?\
Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.\
Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.\
Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.\
Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.\
Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those "Gods"...\
Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.\
Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.\
Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.\
Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need...just be sure.\
Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]\
Laura Barton: I can feel the difference. [U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab she sees Ultron]\
Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.\
Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?\
Ultron: I expect you to know why.\
Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] "This is the next thing, Tony."\
Ultron: This...is the next me.\
Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.\
Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho] [at Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]\
Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.\
Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.\
Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.\
Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.\
Bruce Banner: Missed our window.\
Natasha Romanoff: Did we?\
Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.\
Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...\
Bruce Banner: What did you dream?\
Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.\
Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.\
Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she leans close into him]\
Bruce Banner: What are you doing?\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.\
Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]\
Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...\
Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?\
Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.\
Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just...there's no future with me. I can't ever...I can't have this, kids, do the math, I physically can't.\
Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?\
Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear? [Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]\
Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?\
Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.\
Steve Rogers: "Earth's Mightiest Heroes." Pulled us apart like cotton candy.\
Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.\
Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?\
Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.\
Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.\
Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?\
Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.\
Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.\
Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.\
Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?\
Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time. [Laura interrupts them]\
Laura Barton: I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...\
Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you? [suddenly Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]\
Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.\
Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?\
Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.\
Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?\
Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.\
Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.\
Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.\
Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.\
Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.\
Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.\
Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.\
Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.\
Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't. [Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]\
Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.\
Thor: I need your help.\
Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.\
Thor: It's dangerous.\
Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't. [back at Barton's house Fury meets with the rest of the team]\
Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.\
Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?\
Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.\
Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?\
Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.\
Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.\
Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.\
Steve Rogers: NEXUS?\
Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.\
Clint Barton: So what'd they say?\
Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.\
Tony Stark: By whom?\
Nick Fury: Parties unknown.\
Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?\
Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.\
Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."\
Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.\
Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.\
Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.\
Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]\
Nick Fury: So what does he want?\
Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.\
Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.\
Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.\
Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.\
Nick Fury: How?\
Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho? [in Korea, Cho is creating a new body for Ultron]\
Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought...\
Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron breaks open the scepter's blue gem and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body] [back at the Barton's farm]\
Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.\
Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.\
Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...\
Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.\
Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.\
Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?\
Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently. What are you gonna do?\
Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.\
Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.\
Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.\
Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet] [Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]\
Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.\
Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.\
Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well. [NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]\
Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.\
World Hub Tech: How do you find it?\
Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he conducts his search] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me. [back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]\
Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]\
Erik Selvig: Thor!\
Ultron: [he sees visions of Ultron] Extinction. [then he sees the creation of the Infinity Stones] [in Korea with Cho and Ultron]\
Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.\
Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.\
Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...\
Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.\
Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is... [Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams]\
Wanda Maximoff: How could you?\
Ultron: How could I what?\
Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.\
Ultron: It will be better.\
Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.\
Ultron: That is not...! The human race will have every opportunity to improve.\
Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?\
Ultron: Ask Noah.\
Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.\
Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.\
Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak? [as Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]\
Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]\
Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off]\
Ultron: Ah, wait, guys!. [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]\
Steve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!\
Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.\
Steve Rogers: Where?\
Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.\
Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.\
Dr. Helen Cho: Go.\
Steve Rogers: [on the Quinjet, listening to Steve on the radio comms] Did you guys copy that?\
Clint Barton: We did.\
Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.\
Clint Barton: [noticing a truck leaving the lab] There. It's the truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.\
Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]\
Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!\
Steve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.\
Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.\
Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron blasts Steve as he tries to enter the truck, but Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]\
Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.\
Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]\
Ultron: Stop it! [he throws Steve shield aside and blasts him]\
Clint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three...give 'em hell. [Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck and picks up Steve's shield]\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.\
Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.\
Natasha Romanoff: Which way?\
Clint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck, she throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock off Ultron from him]\
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way! Coming through! Sorry, coming through! [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on the truck]\
Steve Rogers: Come on!\
Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?\
Clint Barton: Let's find out.\
Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep! [Barton manages to draw out the Ultron sentries from the truck]\
[Steve later tackles Ultron into a train, the Ultron Sentries leave Barton and return to Ultron]\
Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you're going to do, do it now.\
Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in, Cap can you keep him occupied?\
Steve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron] What do you think I've been doing? [as Natasha enters the truck the Iron Legions head back, pick up the truck and lift off]\
Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.\
Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.\
Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?\
Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.\
Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?\
Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that. [Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]\
Ultron: Please. Don't do this.\
Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have? [Ultron flies off]\
Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way.\
Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go. [Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]\
Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?\
Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!\
Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?\
Steve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back on the train to the twins] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians out of the way of the train Wanda uses her powers and stops the train] [after stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]\
Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.\
Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.\
Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?\
Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.\
Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.\
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.\
Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.\
Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?\
Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that? [after Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]\
Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?\
Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.\
Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.\
Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.\
Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?\
Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton goes off]\
Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.\
Tony Stark: Yeah, about that. [Banner looks at Stark]\
Bruce Banner: No.\
Tony Stark: You have to trust me.\
Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.\
Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up Jarvis's consciousness]\
JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.\
Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.\
Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?\
Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.\
Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?\
Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.\
JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.\
Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.\
Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.\
Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me\'85[bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] "\'85just makes me stronger." [locks Natasha in a cell] [Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]\
Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.\
Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes. [Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]\
Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.\
Tony Stark: How about "nonce"?\
Steve Rogers: Shut it down!\
Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.\
Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.\
Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?\
Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.\
Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.\
Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened...\
Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!\
Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!\
Steve Rogers: This isn't a game...\
Wanda Maximoff: The creature...! [Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]\
Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying? [suddenly Barton shoots a bullet below caused the glass Pietro is standing to stand to smash and he falls through]\
Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!\
Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?\
Bruce Banner: [to Wanda] Go ahead, piss me off. [just then Thor enters and pounds the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the body who has JARVIS' voice and has become the Vision]\
Vision: I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.\
Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?\
Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at it's center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]\
Bruce Banner: What, the gem?\
Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.\
Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...\
Thor: Because Stark is right.\
Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.\
Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.\
Vision: Not alone.\
Steve Rogers: Why does your "vision" sound like JARVIS?\
Tony Stark: We...we reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.\
Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.\
Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?\
Steve Rogers: You're not?\
Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am...I am.\
Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.\
Vision: Look again.\
Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.\
Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...\
Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?\
Vision: I don't think it's that simple.\
Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.\
Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.\
Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?\
Vision: You.\
Bruce Banner: Where?\
Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.\
Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...\
Vision: What will you do? [he looks at them all realizing they will destroy him] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer and hands it to him, Vision walks off and everyone stares in shock]\
Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.\
Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need. [they all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]\
FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.\
Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.\
Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.\
Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.\
Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.\
Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out. [Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]\
Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns, takes a shotgun and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses. [Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]\
Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.\
Bruce Banner: [inside her cell Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!\
Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?\
Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?\
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.\
Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.\
Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?\
Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up gun and blasts the cell door open]\
Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?\
Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.\
Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.\
Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.\
Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear? [as the city is being evacuated]\
FRIDAY: Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]\
Ultron: Come to confess your sins?\
Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?\
Ultron: More than you.\
Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...\
Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.\
Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?\
Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [suddenly the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?\
FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.\
Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time. [Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]\
Steve Rogers: Go!\
Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run! [Vision then finds Ultron]\
Vision: Ultron.\
Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.\
Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.\
Ultron: Alright. [they start battling it out]\
Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?\
FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.\
Ultron: [to the Vision] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core and the earth around Sokovia starts to shake and break]\
Tony Stark: FRIDAY?\
FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride. [as Sokovia is being destroyed]\
Ultron: Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal. [as the earth is shaking falling in around them]\
Bruce Banner: We gotta move.\
Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?\
Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.\
Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]\
FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.\
Tony Stark: If it drops?\
FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, Tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]\
Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]\
FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.\
Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.\
Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off. [Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots attach the city]\
Clint Barton: Go, go, move!\
Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]\
Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?\
Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.\
Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting his arrows at the robots]\
Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw over to Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]\
Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never... [he throws off one of the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]\
Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of the woman's car he was saving] What, were you napping?\
Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me. [as Barton is fighting off the robots Wanda suddenly comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]\
Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.\
Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!\
Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]\
Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man! [Barton holds his arrow to aim it at Pietro]\
Clint Barton: Nobody would know. Nobody. "The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."\
Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff! [he throws his shield at her so she can use it to protect herself from the attacking robot]\
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks. [back to Stark]\
FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.\
Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...\
FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.\
Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.\
FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.\
Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?\
Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.\
Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.\
Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.\
Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...\
Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.\
Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.\
Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.\
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?\
Nick Fury: [voice] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [just then the Helicarrier show up] [inside the Helicarrier] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.\
Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.\
Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?\
Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.\
Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two...take 'em out. [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards the them]\
Pietro Maximoff: This is SHIELD?\
Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.\
Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.\
Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.\
Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.\
Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.\
Maria Hill: You're up. [Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]\
James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.\
Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.\
James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?\
Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.\
James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.\
Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!\
Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It...it's, uh, full of people.\
Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots flies in and crashes inside the Helicarrier]\
Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]\
Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.\
Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron, Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]\
Vision: It's terribly well balanced.\
Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.\
Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.\
FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.\
Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!\
Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.\
Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.\
James Rhodes: On it.\
Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.\
Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision] You good?\
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.\
Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."\
Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?\
Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose. [Ultron shows up]\
Thor: Is that the best you can do? [Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]\
Steve Rogers: You had to ask.\
Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?\
Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together. [they all fight off Ultron's attacking robots]\
Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hindsight.... [suddenly Hulk knocks him far away and the robots start to retreat]\
Thor: They'll try to leave the city.\
Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!\
James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right ... [just then Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?\
Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.\
Clint Barton: What about the core?\
Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job.\
Wanda Maximoff: [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.\
Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.\
Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [just then she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.\
Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.\
Wanda Maximoff: You understand?\
Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you. [Wanda chuckles]\
Wanda Maximoff: Go.\
FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...\
Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this. [Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]\
Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?\
Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.\
Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.\
Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low. [Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for her brother]\
Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?! [Barton runs off to find the boy]\
Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.\
Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats] Is this the last of them?\
Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.\
Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.\
Thor: Maybe not. [just as Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]\
Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them but Pietro intervenes and takes the shots to save them]\
Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair] [Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]\
Ultron: Oh, for God's sake! [Hulk knocks Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wound]\
Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day. [Wanda then finds the Ultron]\
Ultron: Wanda, if you stay here, you'll die.\
Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that. [Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]\
Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with as the city is being destroyed] Now! [Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]\
Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t... [Hulk turns off Nat's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination, at the same time Vision finds Ultron]\
Vision: You're afraid.\
Ultron: Of you?\
Vision: Of death. You're the last one.\
Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.\
Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments. [Ultron chuckles]\
Ultron: I suppose we are.\
Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.\
Ultron: They're doomed.\
Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.\
Ultron: You're unbearably naive.\
Vision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]\
Laura Barton: [we see Barton returning to his family on the farm, then we see Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York; Natasha looks at Barton's new baby on her phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]\
Natasha Romanoff: Fat.\
Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.\
Natasha Romanoff: Right.\
Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.\
Natasha Romanoff: "Wish you were here." You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?\
Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.\
Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.\
Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.\
Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.\
Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.\
Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.\
Tony Stark: A machine.\
Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.\
Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.\
Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.\
Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.\
Steve Rogers: Thank you.\
Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.\
Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...\
Tony Stark: It would still go up.\
Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.\
Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.\
Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.\
Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...\
Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?\
Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?\
Thor: I do. Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard which burns a circle in the grass he was standing on]\
Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]\
Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.\
Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.\
Steve Rogers: The simple life.\
Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.\
Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]\
Tony Stark: You alright?\
Steve Rogers: I'm home. [last lines; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.\
Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?\
Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]\
Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.\
Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.\
Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Sam in his Falcon suit, Wanda in a new suit, and Vision]\
Steve Rogers: Avengers...!\
[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]\
Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.\
[End of Avengers: Age of Ultron]\
