EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there. Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow. CLINT BARTON
 (CONT'D) Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers LILA BARTON  Why three? CLINT BARTON ‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s too muchLAURA BARTON (O.S.) You guys want mustard or mayo, or both? CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer. LILA BARTON 
Who puts mayo on a hot dog? CLINT BARTON We’ll both have mustard, hon! (to Lila) Okay. Draw back, deep breath... She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow. LAURA BARTON (O.S.) Enough murder practice! Soup’s on!
CLINT BARTON One sec, babe. Be right there! We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. We’re hungry. But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie at his feet. He stares.  CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Lila? Babe, did you see LilaHe turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE. So are the boys. The soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket. NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Guys? Guys, come on... Clint walks toward the field, dread growing. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Laura? Clint breaks into a panicked run. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) LAURA! CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC... MARVEL FLIP EXT. SPACE - NIGHT BLACKNESS. TITLE: “TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.” Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift... INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football. She wins. TONY (offering his hand) Good sport. Have fun? Nebula studies his hand, confused. Finally she shakes. NEBULA It was fun. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks.   TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.” TONY This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT THE BENATAR sparks, adrift. TONY (O.S.) I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twentytwo. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound. TONY (O.S.) You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her. She’s very practical. And only a tiny bit sadistic. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR. TONY (O.S.) The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge. Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Problem is that was about...49 hours ago. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.   TONY (O.S.) Which means, we’re dead in the water. A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER. She pushes it back to him. TONY (O.S.) Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the glass, staring into the unknown. TONY Pep, I know I said no more surprises. But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Back to now. Tony records his thoughts into his helmet. TONY Don’t feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you. It’s always you. Tony switches the helmet off. TIME CUT: NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR. TIME CUT:   Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair. Tony slumps, completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy. Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER. Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun. Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony’s eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see... CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT STEVE ROGERS shaves. He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He’s about to tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when... THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled. Then the lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY. Just then, a sound roars overhead. Steve turns... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS. Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch a flying woman guide the ship to the ground. Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group. TIME CUT: Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp. TONY I couldn’t stop him. STEVE Neither could we. TONY I lost the kid. STEVE (unable to say it all) We...lost... TONY Is Pepper...?   JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS. PEPPER POTTS Stay here, you stay right hereTONY I’m not going anywhere. NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch... A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE’VE LOST: WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T’CHALLA. MARIA HILL. RHODEY It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth. TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into his arm. He stares, taking in the loss: SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER. SCOTT LANG. HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY. At Fury, Carol bites back emotion. NATASHA World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do. JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER. Finally, Tony looks away. RHODEY turns it off. NATASHA (CONT'D) Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth. CAROL DANVERS Not just Earth. RHODEY You sure about that?   CAROL DANVERS You never have to ask me that. TONY Where is he now? STEVE We don’t know. He just opened a portal and walked through. Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio. TONY What’s his deal? ROCKET (O.S.) He’s pissed. Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time. ROCKET (CONT'D) He thinks he failed. Which, of course, he did. But there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there? TONY Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear. STEVE We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing. Tony, you fought himTONY Who told you that? I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. There was no fight because he’s not beatable. STEVE Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinatesTony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve. TONY I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe. I thought I was dreaming...   STEVE Tony, I need you to focusTONY And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It’s too late, buddy. You know what I need? Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable. TONY (CONT'D) I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. (stands) And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or notSTEVE But that didn’t work out, did it? TONY I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.” Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-” RHODEY Tony, take it easy... TONY I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. (rips out RT) Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. (drops to his knees) I’m fine! Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him.   INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE. RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM. RHODEY Bruce gave him a sedative. Should be out the rest of the day. CAROL DANVERS (heading for the lab) Take care of him. When I come back, I’ll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir. STEVE Where are you going? CAROL DANVERS To kill Thanos. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP. NATASHA Hey, hey, hang on. We’re sort of a team here. Between you and me, morale’s a little fragile. CAROL DANVERS Oh, I’m sorry. My fault. Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up. She claps her hands. CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D) All right, team! I’m going to go kill Thanos. Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I’ll report back when he’s dead. Great work, everybody. STEVE Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too. RHODEY Do you even know where he is?   CAROL DANVERS I know people who mightNEBULA (O.S.) Don’t bother. They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY. NEBULA (CONT'D) I can tell you where Thanos is. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand. NEBULA Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me. When he worked, he talked. About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: “To the Garden.” RHODEY You’re saying Thanos had a retirement plan. STEVE Where’s this garden? ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA). ROCKET When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one’s seen anything like it. He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET. ROCKET (CONT'D) Until two days ago. NATASHA You’re saying he snapped his fingers again. Where?   Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars... NEBULA Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soilSTEVE A garden. BRUCE BANNER Thanos is there. And he just used the stones. Steve eyes everyone. THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP. BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D) (thinking of himself) You know, we’d be going shorthanded. RHODEY Because he killed all our friends. ROCKET Are we saying they’re dead? We’re using that word now? RHODEY He’s still got the stones. CAROL DANVERS So, we take them. And we use them to bring everybody back. BRUCE BANNER Just like that? STEVE Yeah. Just like that. No one speaks. Finally... NATASHA If there’s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who’s not sitting here to try. Everyone looks around the room...AGREED. BRUCE BANNER If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before?   CAROL DANVERS Because before you didn’t have me. RHODEY Hey, new girl. All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where’ve you been all this time? CAROL DANVERS There’s a lot of people in the universe. And they didn’t all have you. THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand. STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR. Carol doesn’t flinch. Thor smiles. THOR I like this one. Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment. Then... STEVE Let’s go get that son of a bitch. SLAM TO: TITLE: “AVENGERS: ENDGAME” INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight deck. STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. CAROL DANVERS Trust me. You get used to it. ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair. ROCKET Okay, who here hasn’t been to space? STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands. ROCKET (CONT'D) Oh, you’re gonna hate this. NEBULA Approaching jump in three, two... STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...   EXT. BENATAR - DAWN WHOOSH! THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE. EXT. SPACE - DAY WHOOSH! THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET. As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet. CAROL DANVERS I’ll head down for recon. If I’m not back in fifteen, you’ll know I found him. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense. NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY CARTER’S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE. NATASHA This is going to work, Steve. STEVE I know it will. (beat) Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t. JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS. CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM) No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It’s just him. NEBULA That’s enough. The Avengers exchange a look. EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE. INT. THANOS’ LODGE - DAY A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE. Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened. A shell of his former self.   He stirs the pot. Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET... PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS. THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others. HE SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND. The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet. He picks it up...and his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others. And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE. STEVE Where are they? Thanos doesn’t answer. CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES. CAROL DANVERS Answer the question! THANOS The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation. BRUCE BANNER You murdered trillions. THANOS You should be grateful. NATASHA Where are the stones? THANOS Gone. Reduced to atoms. BRUCE BANNER You used them two days ago! THANOS I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. That lands, sickening. ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS. ROCKET No...they can’t be gone...   RHODEY He’s lying. NEBULA My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. THANOS Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I’ve treated youSWOOSH. THOR’S AXE SEVERS THANOS’ HEAD FROM HIS BODY. IT HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME. ROCKET What did you do? Thor just stares, his long journey a failure. THOR I went for the head. As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the ground. IT’S OVER. THEY LOST. FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK: “FIVE YEARS LATER.” EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi. THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN. EXT. NEW YORK - DAY A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER. EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled parking lot. Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER. INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS. IT READS, “WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY’RE GONE?” The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.”   A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP. GRIEVING MAN So, I went on a date the other day. JIMMY Good job, Bobby. Back in the game. GRIEVING MAN Thank you, Jimmy. (to the group) First in five years. I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about? STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY. STEVE What did you talk about? GRIEVING MAN Same old crap. How much things have changed. How much we miss the Mets. My job, his job. Then it got kind of quiet. He cried during the salads. OLDER MAN What about you? GRIEVING MAN I cried just before dessert. But I’m seeing him again tomorrow. So... STEVE That’s great. You’ve already done the hardest part. You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take. To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... (to everyone) I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life. Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going. The group takes this in.   STEVE (CONT'D) The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us. People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.” THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL. A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS. IT ACCIDENTALLY STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN. FLASH. THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG, ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.” EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away. The Guard watches him go, puzzled. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES. SCOTT LANG Hello? He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing card wedged between his spokes. Scott waves him down. The kid stops.   SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Hey. Kid. What happened here? The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haunted look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park. A small crowd mills. Reveal Scott looking over the monuments, lost. TIME CUT: Scott walks up to the obelisks. At the top, they read: “THE VANISHED.” Hundreds of names line the stones. He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.” SCOTT LANG What? (realizing) Cassie... EXT. MAGGIE LANG’S HOUSE - DAY A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house. He leaps a bush, banging on the front door. SCOTT LANG Cassie! Cassie! SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked. A very long beat. CASSIE LANG Dad? SCOTT LANG Peanut? Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING. CASSIE LANG I thought you were gone. SCOTT LANG I’m sorry. I’m back...I’m back...I’m back...   EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass. Rusty chains lock the gate. Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA. KEEP OUT.” INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE. ROCKET (HOLO) We boarded that “highly suspect warship” Danvers pinged. NATASHA And? NEBULA (HOLO) It was an infectious garbage scow. ROCKET (HOLO) So thanks for the hot tipCAROL DANVERS (HOLO) You were closer. ROCKET (HOLO) And now we smell like garbageNATASHA (to Okoye) You get a reading on those tremors? OKOYE (HOLO) Minor subduction in the African plate. NATASHA Do we have a visual? How are you handling it? OKOYE (HOLO) Nat. It was a mild earthquake. In the ocean. We handle it by not handling it. Natasha looks burdened. Rhodey steps in.  (MORE)  RHODEY (HOLO) I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure. NATASHA Thanks. Carol, you’re still coming our way next month? CAROL DANVERS (HOLO) Not likely. ROCKET (HOLO) Getting another haircut? CAROL DANVERS (HOLO) Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory out here. The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else. On thousands of planets. You might not see me for a long time. NATASHA All right. Everybody keep keeping their eyes open. This channel’s always active. Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn’t, it comes through me. They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey. NATASHA (CONT'D) What’s up? Where are you? RHODEY (HOLO) Mexico. Got some news. NATASHA Okay... RHODEY Federalés found a room full of bodies outside Juarez. Cartel guys. Guns still in their pants. NATASHA Could be a rival hitRHODEY But it wasn’t. Same MO as Marseille. And Kiev. (MORE)  RHODEY (CONT'D)  (beat) It’s definitely Barton. She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting. RHODEY (CONT'D) What he’s done here...what he’s been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn’t want to find him. Natasha just stares a long beat. NATASHA Find out where’s he going next. Rhodey nods, signing off. Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES. After a long beat... STEVE (O.S.) I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already. Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway. NATASHA Come by to do your laundry? STEVE And see a friend. NATASHA Your friend’s fine. STEVE She leave the house today? NATASHA Nothing out there I particularly want to see. STEVE I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge. NATASHA (dubious) In the Hudson. STEVE Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just saying, there’s still a world out there. RHODEY (CONT'D)   NATASHA If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I’m about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich. Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. STEVE Sorry. Force of habit. NATASHA I don’t know how you do it. Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich. STEVE I guess I don’t know how not to. NATASHA Me, neither. After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. STEVE I keep telling them, move on. Grow past it. And some of them actually do. But not us. NATASHA If I move on, who does this? STEVE Maybe it doesn’t need to be done. Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up. She looks around at Avengers Compound. NATASHA I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job, this family. And I was better because of it. She chokes slightly, collecting herself. NATASHA (CONT'D) And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be...better. STEVE I think we both need to get a life. NATASHA You first.   They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment. THEN, WE HEAR A PING. NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY: SCOTT LANG’S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS’ VAN BEHIND HIM. SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN) Hello? Is anyone home? This is, uh, Scott Lang? We met a few years ago. At the airport? STEVE This an old message? NATASHA (stunned) It’s the front gate. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. STEVE (O.S.) Scott, are you okay? SCOTT LANG What? Yes. He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? NATASHA Only to make conversation. Steve glances at her. She shrugs. SCOTT LANG Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you’re incredibly small. Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there. NATASHA I’m sorry. It must’ve been a long five years.   SCOTT LANG (getting excited) Okay, but that’s the thing. It wasn’t. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich? STEVE Scott, what are you talking about? SCOTT LANG Time works differently in the Quantum Realm. Steve and Natasha share a look. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before ThanosSTEVE Wait...wait. Scott. Are you talking about a time machine? SCOTT LANG No, not a machine. More like a... (searches, then gives up) Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy... NATASHA Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing’s crazy anymore. SCOTT LANG So, who do we talk to about this? EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house.   TONY Morgan H. Stark. Chow time. Want some lunch? Silence. Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE). MORGAN STARK Define lunch or be disintegrated. TONY You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom. You thinking about lunch? Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL. TONY (CONT'D) Where’d you find this? MORGAN STARK Garage. Tony picks her up, walking toward the house. TONY You like going in the garage? So does Daddy. It’s all right. Mommy never wears what I buy her. TIME CUT: Tony and Morgan exit the woods. Suddenly, Tony stops. In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him. NATASHA AND SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY. TONY I just want to thank you folks for dropping by. It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape. NATASHA You’ve got some objections to the plan.   TONY So you’re calling it a plan. To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method. Not to mention, it’s impossible. SCOTT LANG We know what it sounds like. STEVE Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible? TONY Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? (offering more tea) Chai? (back on message) In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home. SCOTT LANG I did. TONY Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Now you want to pull aWhat are you calling it? SCOTT LANG A time heist. TONY Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again? SCOTT LANG Still Scott... STEVE Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here. NATASHA We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.   TONY Or screw it up worse than he already has. STEVE I don’t believe we would. Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge. TONY Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.” I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. SCOTT LANG Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting eventsTONY Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future? SCOTT LANG (meaning “yes”) No... TONY Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works. NATASHA We have to take a stand. TONY We did stand. And yet here we are. SCOTT LANG Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony?   TONY Please don’tSCOTT LANG TonyTONY Fine. SCOTT LANG I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here. You’ve got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t evenTONY No, Scott. I won’t. Even. Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch. MORGAN STARK Mommy told me to come save you. Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. TONY Good job. I’m saved. (to Steve) I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I’m honestly happy to see you. If you want to staySteve tries one last time. STEVE Tony, I get it. And I’m happy for you. I am. But this is a second chance. TONY Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can’t roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch. He exits.   EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car. NATASHA He’s scared. STEVE He’s not wrong. SCOTT LANG What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop? STEVE No. I want to do it right. (beat) We’re going to need a really big brain. SCOTT LANG Bigger than his? EXT. DINER - NIGHT ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside. SCOTT LANG (O.S.) I’m confused. INT. DINER - NIGHT SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM. SMART HULK These are confusing times. SCOTT LANG No, that’s not what I’mSMART HULK I’m kidding, I get it. It’s crazy. I wear shirts now! SCOTT LANG But why? SMART HULK Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?  ---  Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites. STEVE He’s heard. SMART HULK It was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then Banner lost. Then we all lost. NATASHA No one blamed you, Bruce. SMART HULK I did- I feel like I’m the only one eating. Here, try some. He holds out a pizza. They decline. He shrugs. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way. That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos. SCOTT LANG Okay. But how did...this happen? SMART HULK For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds. TWO KIDS amble up to the booth. KID Mr. Hulk? Can we get a picture? SMART HULK 100%, little lady. The kid hands a phone to Steve. SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.   SMART HULK (CONT'D) (to the fan) Thanks, pal. Hulk out! STEVE So, Bruce, about what we saidSMART HULK The time travel do-over? I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise... Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them. NATASHA You pulled this off. I remember a time that was impossible, too. He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone. SMART HULK I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT TONY STARK DOES DISHES. He rinses with the sprayer. It goes everywhere. He wipes down the counter, including... A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER. He stares. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes. He studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued. TONY Friday, you up? FRIDAY Yes, sir. TONY I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out. I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted.   FRIDAY Processing. The model forms. TONY All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp. Run it. That’ll take a second. And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of... THE CAPACITOR GLOWS. A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT. FRIDAY Model rendered. TONY (in awe) Shit. MORGAN STARK (O.S.) Shit. Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway. TONY What are you doing up? MORGAN STARK Shit. TONY First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it. MORGAN STARK Why are you up? TONY I just had something on my mind. MORGAN STARK Was it juice pops? TONY Correct. Great minds think alike. What kind do you want?   INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed. Tony watches. TONY You done? (finishing her popsicle) Now you are. MORGAN STARK Tell me a story. TONY Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. MORGAN STARK That was a bad story. He runs his hand over her hair. TONY Love you tons. MORGAN STARK Love you three thousand. TONY Wow, that’s a lot. Tony turns out the light, exits. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony. Even one of HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL. Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading. Then... TONY (O.S.) Out like a light. Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand. PEPPER POTTS That’s up there. TONY What’re you reading? PEPPER POTTS A book about composting  TONY I think I solved it. Pepper looks up. PEPPER POTTS Just so we’re both talking about the same thingTONY Time travel. PEPPER POTTS That’s amazing. TONY Yeah. PEPPER POTTS And terrifying. TONY To say the least. He sits beside her. She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA. PEPPER POTTS We got really luckyTONY I knowPEPPER POTTS Not everybody did. TONY I can’t help everybody. PEPPER POTTS Except, it sort of seems like you can. TONY Not if I stopped right here. PEPPER POTTS Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. TONY I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed.   PEPPER POTTS But could you rest? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE OPEN VAN DOORS. SCOTT LANG You’re sure these modifications are safe? He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL. SMART HULK I reran my calculations three timesSCOTT LANG Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a geniusSMART HULK I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy. We’re good. SCOTT LANG Yeah. And you look like that on purpose. STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside. STEVE Breakers are set, emergency generator’s on stand-by. SMART HULK Good. If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s. SCOTT LANG Excuse me? NATASHA He was kidding. SMART HULK I was kidding.   NATASHA (to Hulk) You were kidding, right? SMART HULK Honestly, I have no idea. We’re attempting time travel. Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. (loudly to Scott) We’re good! Helmet on. Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Okay. I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense? SCOTT LANG Perfectly not confusing. STEVE Good luck, Scott. You’ve got this. SCOTT LANG (inspired) Yes, I do, Captain America. Yes, ISMART HULK PULLS A LEVER. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. SMART HULK Counting down from three, two, one... SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD. SCOTT LANG Uh, guys? This doesn’t feel right. NATASHA Is that Scott? SMART HULK Probably...? He scrambles, hitting buttons. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. STEVE Get him back! Smart Hulk flips a switch. SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93.   SCOTT LANG Oh, my back! NATASHA Bruce! Get it under control. What the hell is going on? SMART HULK I got it, I know exactly what’s going on. Pretty much. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN. HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys. 2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS. NATASHA Oh, my God. STEVE It’s a baby. SMART HULK It’s Scott. STEVE As a baby! Smart Hulk hits a button. Baby Scott disappears. SMART HULK When I tell you, kill the power! (throwing a switch) Now! NATASHA KILLS THE POWER. Normal Scott stumbles off the pad. SCOTT LANG Somebody peed my pants. I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY Steve leans on the wall, discouraged. Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR. AN AUDI races up the drive. It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY. TONY Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby?   STEVE Among other things. TONY (getting out of the car) EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it. STEVE You did. TONY Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it. He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR. TONY (CONT'D) That is a fully-functioning, timespace GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it. STEVE Me, too. Something eases between them, for the first time in years. TONY We’ve got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let’s not die trying. Steve looks at Tony. Finally, he offers his hand. STEVE Sounds like a deal. They shake. This is a long time coming. Finally... TONY But wait, there’s more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer. Tony pops the trunk. Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD. STEVE Tony, I don’t know  TONY What’s to know? He made it for you. Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM. STEVE Thank you, Tony. Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk. TONY Just don’t flaunt it. I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right? STEVE We’re trying. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco. THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away. THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND. NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE. Rocket waits at the end of the gangway. ROCKET Hey, Humie. Where’s Big Green? SCOTT LANG Um, kitchen, I think. Scott tries a smile at Nebula. She just hits her COM: NEBULA (INTO COM) Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone. She goes in. THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. SCOTT LANG Oh, my God! RHODEY What’s up, Regular-Sized Man? Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag. He hands Scott some tacos.   ROCKET Finally. I ain’t got all day. SMART HULK I call shotgun! As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND. EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE. Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK. EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN. ASGARDIANS IN EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION. ROCKET What the heck are they looking at? SMART HULK I’m kind of famous... ROCKET Yeah, I’m sure that’s it. Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers... SMART HULK They lost Asgard, then half their people. Maybe they’re just happy to have a home. VALKYRIE (O.S.) You shouldn’t have come. VALKYRIE approaches from the pier. Smart Hulk GRINS. SMART HULK Hey, Valkyrie! Great to see you! He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T. She studies the new him. VALKYRIE Uh huh. I liked you better either of the other ways.   SMART HULK This is Rocket. ROCKET Hey. VALKYRIE Hey. (to both) He won’t see you. SMART HULK We didn’t say we were here to seeVALKYRIE Great, then you can hose out the gut bucketsROCKET We’re definitely here to see him. VALKYRIE He can’t give you what you need. SMART HULK It’s that bad? VALKYRIE We only see him once a month. When he comes in for “supplies.” She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB. EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN. Nothing. INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY SMART HULK opens the door. PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. Rocket recoils. ROCKET Something died in here. SMART HULK Hello...? Thor...? THOR (O.S.) Are you here about the cable? We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.   THOR (CONT'D) Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy... THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT. Rocket and Hulk stare. SMART HULK Thor? THOR BROS! Bring it in! Thor hugs Smart Hulk. He turns to Rocket, who steps back. ROCKET Yeah, I’m good. THOR Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right? KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4. KORG Beer’s in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the WiFi. SMART HULK Hey, guys. Long time noKORG Thor! This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead! THOR Noobmaster again? KORG NoobMaster69 called me a dickheadThor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic. THOR Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder. This is your last warning. Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt. (handing the headset back) Right, who wants a drink?  (MORE)  SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE. Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER. SMART HULK Hey, buddy, are you all right? THOR Don’t I look all right? ROCKET (under his breath) You look like melted ice creamTHOR So, what’s up? Just here for a hang? SMART HULK We need your help. There’s a chance we can fix everything. THOR Like the cable? It’s driving me bananas. SMART HULK Like Thanos. THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE. KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH. THOR Don’t say that name. KORG Yeah, we don’t say that name in here. Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT. SMART HULK Please take your hand off me. Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare youTHOR Scared? Why would I be scared of that guy? I’m the one who killed that guy, remember? (looking around) Anyone else here kill that guy? (MORE)  THOR (CONT'D)  Didn’t think so. Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos’ head off. KORG Stormbreaker? Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle. BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND. Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING. THOR Not. Cool. Man. ROCKET Don’t. Care. Dude. SMART HULK Look, I get it. You’re in a rough patch. I’ve been there. But you know who helped me out of it? THOR Was it Natasha? SMART HULK It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again. THOR Ask the Asgardians down there how much “my help” is worth. ROCKET At least they’re aliveTHOR They were gods! Now they’re fisherpeople! (sagging into a chair) The ones that are left, anyway. SMART HULK That’s the thing. I think we can bring them back. Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head. THOR Stop. Stop. I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own selfpity, waiting to be rescued. But I’m fine. I’m happy. Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less. THOR (CONT'D)   Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor. SMART HULK Come on, pal. We need you. He still can’t meet their gaze. Finally... ROCKET There’s beer in the ship. THOR (beat) What kind? EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS. BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS. TITLE: “TOKYO.” AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING. A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON. KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE. PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET. ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT... WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE. CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES OFF THE STAIRS AS... A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS TELESCOPING BLADE. BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG. THEN... CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. THUD. WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING. GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS...   SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK... LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP. HE ROLLS TO THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE. THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW. RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN. HARD-SET EYES STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK. THEY BATTLE. AKIHIKO (Japanese, subtitled) Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you! RONIN (Japanese, subtitled) You survived. Half the planet didn’t. They got Thanos. You get me. Akihiko attacks. Ronin slashes him across the middle. RONIN (CONT'D) (Japanese, subtitled) You’re done hurting people. Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street. AKIHIKO We hurt people? You’re crazy. Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat. The man drops to his knees. AKIHIKO (CONT'D) Wait! Help me! I’ll give you anything! What do you want? RONIN What I want...you can’t give me. Ronin finishes him off. AKIHIKO GOES STILL. SIRENS WAIL. Ronin removes his mask, revealing... CLINT BARTON, haggard. He hears A FOOTFALL. He whirls, katana raised...then stops. His face goes slack as... NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN. They stare at each other. Clint hasn’t seen her in years. She hasn’t seen what he’s become.  --  CLINT BARTON You shouldn’t be here. NATASHA Neither should you. CLINT BARTON I’ve got a job to do. NATASHA That what you’re calling this? She moves even closer. He stiffens. NATASHA (CONT'D) Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back. (beat) We found something. A chance, maybe... CLINT BARTON Don’t. NATASHA Don’t what? CLINT BARTON Give me hope. NATASHA I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it sooner. CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR. TONY (O.S.) Out of the way, Lebowski. Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past. TONY (CONT'D) Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there? ROCKET (O.S.) It’s Rocket, and shut up. You’re only a genius on Earth, pal.   TONY And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands. ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH. ROCKET Fixed it. TONY Thank you. ROCKET Get used to saying that. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT. NEBULA ASSISTS. RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit. RHODEY Time travel suit, I like it. SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT. SCOTT LANG Easy, easy. Careful with those. SMART HULK I’m being very carefulSCOTT LANG You’re being very HulkyScott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs. Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Plus two test runsSUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in...   SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) One test run. (embarrassed) Okay, maybe I’m not ready. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) I’m game. They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) I’ll do it. TIME CUT: NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT. Scott looks on, sulky. SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing. SMART HULK Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshiftRHODEY Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know... Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE. SMART HULK Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time doesn’t work like that. You can’t change the future by changing the past. SCOTT LANG Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved. NEBULA That’s not how it works. CLINT BARTON I don’t know. That is kind of what I’ve heardSMART HULK Heard from who?   RHODEY Star Trek. Terminator. Bill and Ted’s ExcellentSMART HULK WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE. IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE! NEBULA Exactly. RHODEY Excuse me? Scott leans over, whispering: SCOTT LANG Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit. CLINT BARTON Look, are we doing this or not? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT. SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on. SMART HULK Okay, Clint. Starting in three, two, one... Clint nods over at them, determined. SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, SHRINKS, AND VANISHES. WHOOSH. EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor. ENERGY FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT. He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME.   EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY Clint climbs the porch. He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL MITT. Then he hears VOICES. He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR. From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS. Clint’s face crumples. Just then...HIS QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES. A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03. CLINT BARTON No. Not yet... (opening the door) LILA! BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW. 0.01- CLINT VANISHES. THE SCREEN DOOR SLAMS. After a moment, LILA runs in. LILA BARTON Dad? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN. TONY and NATASHA approach. NATASHA Are you all right? Hey, look at me. You okay? TONY Tell me something good... Clint looks up, tearful. He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT. CLINT BARTON It worked. It worked. Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on. ROCKET Holy crap. We’re freaking time travelers. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO) On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.” Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.   STEVE Okay. Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when. NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on. STEVE (CONT'D) Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity StonesTONY I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones. SCOTT LANG I haven’t. (off their looks) Just...saying. SMART HULK Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each. And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. TONY Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. CLINT BARTON Which means we’ve got to pick our targets. STEVE Exactly. (he taps “REALITY”) Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know? Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over. NATASHA Is he asleep? RHODEY I’m pretty sure he’s dead. DISSOLVE TO: THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY” Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”  (MORE)  THOR The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge. My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years. HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction. Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye. THOR (CONT'D) Or...by Jane. She stuck her hand in a rock. Then the Aether stuck itself inside her. Then I took her to Asgard. We were dating... (depressed) We’re not anymore. Everyone stares. DISSOLVE TO: INT.

ROCKET Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.” SMART HULK That’s a person? ROCKET It’s a planet. Quill was a person. SCOTT LANG Wait, like a planet...in space? Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek. ROCKET Aw, look. It’s like a puppy, all happy and everything. (MORE)  ROCKET (CONT'D)  You want to go to space, puppy? I’ll take you to space. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit quietly, listening to Nebula. NEBULA Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. NATASHA And that is...? NEBULA A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence. (beat) It’s the place where Thanos murdered my sister. That hangs heavily. A moment passes. Then... SCOTT LANG Not it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out. NATASHA So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what kind of doctor was he? SMART HULK Strange? TONY Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat. SMART HULK Had a nice place in the Village. TONY Yeah. Sullivan Street. ROCKET (CONT'D)   SMART HULK Bleecker. TONY Sullivan and Bleecker. They’re cross streets. NATASHA Wait, he lived in New York? Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York. SMART HULK (beat) Shut the front door... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY STEVE blocks our view. STEVE Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot. He steps away, revealing the board... EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES. IT’S INSANE. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS. OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN THEIR TIME SUITS. STEVE (O.S.) Five years ago, we lost. All of us. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM. STEVE We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. (beat) But today we have a chance to take it all back. Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT & CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.   STEVE (CONT'D) You have your teams and you have assignments. Get your stone, and get back here. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. He grips HIS SHIELD. STEVE (CONT'D) Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn’t mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to. (looking around) This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. (beat) Whatever it takes. The platform stays quiet. Rocket WHISPERS to Scott: ROCKET He’s pretty good at that... Scott nods enthusiastically. TONY (to Smart Hulk) All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL. LIGHTS ILLUMINATE EACH PAD. SMART HULK Tracking beacons engaged. Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside. ROCKET You promise to bring that thing back in one piece? CLINT BARTON Yeah, sure thing. I’ll do my best. ROCKET That’s pretty lame, as far as promises go. SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP. THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE. NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.   NATASHA See you in a minute. SMART HULK Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give orSUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY. WHOOSH. THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING.

Stay low, keep an eye on timeJust then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS. STEVE (CONT'D) And Bruce? Maybe smash a few things along the way. For appearances. SMART HULK (taking off his shirt) All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous. He half-heartedly smashes a few cars.   SMART HULK (CONT'D) Grrr...grrr... EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1) THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER THE VILLAGE. SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE. ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS. He heads for a door, but... ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) I’d be careful going that way... He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) We just had the floors waxed. SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER. SMART HULK Hulk...does what...Hulk want? ANCIENT ONE Yes, I suppose that would be the caseJUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF. HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY. Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish. The Ancient One looks at him. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Care to explain? SMART HULK I’m looking for Dr. Strange. ANCIENT ONE You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way. What do you want with him? He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK. SMART HULK Well, that, actually. ANCIENT ONE Ah. I’m afraid not. SMART HULK I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking. Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in. She smiles. ANCIENT ONE You don’t want to do this. SMART HULK You’re right, I don’t. But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate itHe reaches for it. THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK. “ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body. He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed. ASTRAL BANNER No, no, noShe topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger. Whump. ANCIENT ONE Now. Let’s start over, shall we? INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) TITLE: ASGARD, 2013 AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A GREEN DRESS. MAIDEN (O.S.) For you, Lady Jane. JANE FOSTER (O.S.) Um, do you have anything with...pants? MAIDEN (O.S.) Pants? JANE FOSTER (O.S.) It’s okay. Nevermind. Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt. Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.   THOR That’s Jane. ROCKET Okay, here’s the deal. You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split. Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious. THOR Um, I’ll be right back. The wine cellar is just down here. My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale. Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cupsThey hear SOMEONE APPROACHING. Rocket yanks Thor back as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR. FRIGGA Send Loki some soup. I don’t think he’s eating. And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves. He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company. Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall. ROCKET Who’s the fancy broad? THOR My mother. She dies today. ROCKET Oh, jeez. Thor starts to sweat. THOR I can’t do this. This is a bad idea. I can’t do this... Rocket climbs onto a marble monument. ROCKET Come here.  (MORE)  Thor steps closer. ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. ROCKET (CONT'D) You think you’re the only one who’s lost people? What do you think we’re doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone. I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads. I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone. Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone. And you can help them. So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back? Thor stares at him a long moment. He wipes his tears away. THOR I guess not. ROCKET Good. THOR Thank you. I can do this. ROCKET Great. As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself. THOR I can do this...I can do this... (beat) I can’t do this... ROCKET (peering through keyhole) All right, heartbreaker. This is our shot... Rocket turns to find...THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. ROCKET (CONT'D) Thor? (holding his temples) (MORE)  ROCKET (CONT'D)  I can kill him, and say the Elves did it. EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS) TITLE: MORAG,  STIFF WINDS PELT THE SURFACE OF MORAG.

TONY (INTO COM) Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass. STEVE (OVER COM) No one asked you to look, Tony. REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY’S SHOULDER. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) I think you look great, Cap. As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass. A1 NATASHA Who gets the magic wand? A1 STEVE SHIELD’s coming up now. TONY Ball’s in play.

Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS. BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.” BROCK RUMLOW We promise to be extra careful. Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. SCOTT LANG Who are these guys? TONY SHIELD. Actually, Hydra. But we didn’t know that yet. SCOTT LANG Seriously? ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys. TONY You’re small but you’re talking loud. A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE. A1 STEVE (INTO COM) I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue. Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE. LOKI/STEVE “I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.” I mean, really, how do you keep your food down? Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM. A1 THOR Yes, that’s much better. He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR. A1 THOR (CONT'D) You coming, Stark?   Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE. A1 TONY One sec, just packing my lunch. TONY All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone A1 Tony crosses to the elevator. Scott takes position, readying himself. SCOTT LANG All right. Flick me. Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the ATTACHE CASE.

The doors close. Everyone rides in silence. Tension mounts. STEVE (CONT'D) I got a call from the Secretary’s office. I’m going to be running point on the scepter. Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. AGENT SITWELL Sir? I don’t understandSTEVE We’ve had word there might be an attempt to steal it.

He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess. ALEXANDER PIERCE My friends call me Mr. Secretary. (to Thor) I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me. A1 THOR Loki will answer to Odin, himself. ALEXANDER PIERCE No, he’ll answer to us. “Odin” can have what’s left. (to Tony) And we’ll need the case back, too.

SCOTT LANG Here goes... SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST. ALEXANDER PIERCE Stark? A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping. THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND. PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist. ALEXANDER PIERCE (CONT'D) MEDIC! A1 THOR Stark? Somebody get some help! Is it your chest machine? THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE. In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE. He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD. It SPINS across the floor... RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND. Tony walks toward a side door.   TONY (INTO COM) Meet me in the alley. I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’sBUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM) Disregard. I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor.   STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD. STEVE I’m not Loki. And I don’t want to hurt you. A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK. A1 STEVE You’re not going to get the chanceA1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE. Steve stumbles. STEVE Forgot about that one. They grapple. Both their shields fall to the ground... THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms. A1 Steve looks impressed. A1 STEVE SWINGS. STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM. A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off. A1 STEVE I can do this all daySTEVE Yeah, I know... They battle on. A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS: THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE. A1 Steve goes cold. He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED. A1 STEVE Where’d you get this? STEVE PX. Camp Lehigh. 1943. A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing. A1 STEVE You’ve got a lot of nerve.

THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden. She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own. ASTRAL BANNER Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that. ANCIENT ONE And yet, you’re the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas. Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas. He steps out of it. ASTRAL BANNER Lady, I just want to borrow your necklaceANCIENT ONE At what cost? SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, SPINNING IN UNISON. A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits. She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.  (MORE)  ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not. SHE GESTURES. OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL... TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM. ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) (CONT'D) In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY. HE OPENS HIS MOUTH... BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. (beat) Now tell me, Doctor. Can your science prevent all that? ASTRAL BANNER No. But it can erase it. Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE. ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D) Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline. At the moment it was taken. So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left. HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK. THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS. ANCIENT ONE You’re leaving out the most important part, though. In order to put the stones back, you’d have to survive. ASTRAL BANNER We will. I will. I promise. ANCIENT ONE I can’t risk this reality on a promise. (MORE)  ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)  It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time StoneASTRAL BANNER Yeah? Then why the hell did Strange give it away? The Ancient One freezes. ANCIENT ONE What did you say? ASTRAL BANNER Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone. ANCIENT ONE Willingly? Why? ASTRAL BANNER Don’t know. Maybe he made a mistake. ANCIENT ONE Or I did. The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Strange is meant to be the best of us. ASTRAL BANNER Then he must have had a reason. ANCIENT ONE I fear you may be right... Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH! HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY. Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY. SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM. SMART HULK Thank you.

EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA. GAMORA I don’t understand. Two Nebulas? Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces. THANOS No. The same Nebula. From two different times. (to Ebony Maw) Set course for Morag. And scan the duplicate’s memories. (beat) I want to see everything...   INT.

FRIGGA You’re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. (re. his bathrobe) What are you wearing? THOR I always wear this. It’s one of my favorites. FRIGGA And what’s wrong with your eye? THOR Oh, that. You remember the...Battle of Harokin. I took a...broadsword to the face? He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom. Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM. FRIGGA Oh. You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you? THOR Yes, I amFRIGGA I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, you know that. (eyeing him) I can see the future hasn’t been kind to you, has it? THOR I didn’t say I was from the future...   FRIGGA Thor... Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look. Thor stares at his mom a long moment. Then, he cracks: THOR I’m totally from the future. FRIGGA Yes, you are. THOR I need to talk to you. FRIGGA We can talk.

Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard? THOR Yeah, I guess. FRIGGA An idiot, no. A failure, absolutely.   THOR That’s a little harshFRIGGA Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it. THOR Okay, maybe just stop talking. FRIGGA And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. THOR I’m not supposed to be like everyone else, though. FRIGGA Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are. Thor stares at her, biting back emotions. THOR I’ve really missed you, Mum. INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND. ROCKET I got it I got it I got it!

THOR I wish we had more timeFRIGGA This was a gift. Now, go be the man you’re meant to be. (beat) And eat a salad. Thor smiles. He and Rocket activate their time suits. ROCKET Three...twoTHOR No. Wait. THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A long moment passes. ROCKET What am I looking at? FRIGGA Sometimes it takes a second. Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND. She grins, proud. THOR (relieved) Still worthy. Mother and son look at each other for the last time. THOR (CONT'D) Goodbye, Mum. FRIGGA Goodbye, Son. THEN, WHOOSH! THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR.

When the horizon finally settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM. QUILL Oh, fuBAM! RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE. Quill drops, out cold. RHODEY Sorry about that. I know you guys were teammates and everything. NEBULA Do you hear me complaining? Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack. She pulls out AN ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK. RHODEY What is that?

RHODEY I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually... Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS. RHODEY (CONT'D) Traps and stuff. (Nebula steps inside) Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you. Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing. RHODEY (CONT'D) These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix. Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless weSUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB. SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM. She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER BLACKENED CLAW. NEBULA I wasn’t always like this. He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her. Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens. RHODEY Yeah, me either. I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh? SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE. RHODEY (CONT'D) Let’s get out of here. Place gives me the creeps.

We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stonesTONY You’re not helpingSCOTT LANG You ruined the Time Heist! TONY Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It’s a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can flySTEVE Loki could be anywhere in the universe. We’d be old men before we found him. As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING... STEVE (CONT'D) What other options did we have on the Tesseract? SCOTT LANG Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home. STEVE But if we don’t try, nobody else comes home, either. TONY I got it! There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. (to Steve) Military installation, Garden State. Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.   STEVE When were they both there? TONY I have a vaguely exact idea. STEVE How vague? SCOTT LANG Hang on, what’s in New Jersey? TONY I know they were there, and I know how I know. STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT... STEVE Looks like we’re improvising. SCOTT LANG Wait! What are you improvising? STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF. STEVE Scott, take this back to the Compound. TONY All right, suits on. Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70... SCOTT LANG Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back.

Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, “MUNITIONS.” He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD.

HOWARD STARK Easy to rememberTONY Potts. HOWARD STARK I’m Howard Stark. (shaking hands) You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air? TONY That’d be swell.

TONY How far along is she? HOWARD STARK Gee, I suppose... (indicating) ...this far. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again. TONY I have a little girl. TONY SMILES. He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born. HOWARD STARK A girl would be nice. Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me. TONY Would that be so bad? HOWARD STARK Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest. The elevator doors open. INT.

You’ve never seen either of these men before? FEMALE SHIELD AGENT No. But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy. M.P. Describe ‘fishy’. FEMALE SHIELD AGENT One of them had a hippie beard. M.P. We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? FEMALE SHIELD AGENT Definitely Mungo Jerry. M.P. (over walkie-talkie) This is Chesler. We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach. Steve ducks through the nearest door... INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970) Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it from another bullpen. Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE. Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.” Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him. Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall. PEGGY CARTER So, send them in. MALE AGENT They’re trying, ma’am, but Braddock’s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. PEGGY CARTER Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain. MALE AGENT (O.S.) Yes, ma’am. Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED. Peggy rifles through a file cabinet. PEGGY CARTER Here we are... She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing. PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D) Crikey O’Reilly. (calling out) Sergeant? Hang up and call Air Command. Braddock needs back up, immediately. MALE AGENT Ma’am? PEGGY CARTER Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at... She slaps the file closed and hurries out. Steve stares after her a long moment. EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970) Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. TONY Got any names, yet? HOWARD STARK If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. TONY You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time. HOWARD STARK What are you, couple years older than me? TONY Yeah. I guess. HOWARD STARK Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous? TONY Wildly. HOWARD STARK Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? TONY I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did... HOWARD STARK My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt. TONY I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there. HOWARD STARK Like what? TONY “No amount of money ever bought a second of time.” HOWARD STARK That’s good. Smart guy. TONY He did his best.  HOWARD STARK I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door. HOWARD STARK (CONT'D) Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack. Isn’t that right? EDWIN JARVIS Indeed, sir. I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo. Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO. Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand. HOWARD STARK Well, good to meet you, Potts. TONY You’re going to do fine, Howard. HOWARD STARK Thanks. See you around? TONY Count on it...

SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL. RED SKULL (CONT'D) A soul for a soul. Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned. TIME CUT: RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) Maybe he’s full of shit. FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE. NATASHA I don’t think so. CLINT BARTON Why, because he knew your daddy’s name? NATASHA I didn’t. (off his look) Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. You really think that’s a coincidence? They both look out at the well, heavy. NATASHA (CONT'D) (under her breath) Whatever it takes... CLINT BARTON (under his breath) Whatever it takes... Natasha goes to Clint, resolved. NATASHA If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. CLINT BARTON Then I guess we both know who it has to be. NATASHA Yeah. Guess we do. They take each other’s hand. A long goodbye beat. Except... CLINT BARTON I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person. NATASHA For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here. This is all it’s been about. Bringing everybody back. CLINT BARTON Do not get all decent on meNATASHA You think I want to do it? I’m trying to save your life, you idiotCLINT BARTON And I don’t want you to. (beat) Nat. You know what I’ve done. What I am now.

Clint squeezes away tears. CLINT BARTON We can’t get her back. THOR What’s he talking about? Of course, we can. CLINT BARTON It can’t be undone. That’s why. THOR No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being. We’re talking about space magic, here. “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think? CLINT BARTON Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she? THOR That’s my pointCLINT BARTON It can’t be undone. At least that’s what the red, floating guy said. But why don’t you go talk to him, okay? Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him. IT CAN’T BE UNDONE.

FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET. SMART HULK (under his breath) Everybody’s coming home... HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES. THOR What’s happening? Take it off, take if off! STEVE Bruce, you okay? TONY Talk to me, Banner.  SMART HULK I’m...okay... THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS. CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES UP SMART HULK’S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN. A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA. SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. AS SHE HURRIES AWAY... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. EVERYONE RUSHES OVER. Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse. STEVE Bruce! TONY Don’t move him! Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING. SCOTT walks toward the courtyard. Smart Hulk’s eyes clear. He grasps Steve’s arm. SMART HULK Did it work? They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them. JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES. A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.” CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. CLINT BARTON Honey? AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED. SCOTT LANG Guys, I think itBOOM! THE BUILDING EXPLODES. DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed. Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture. AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought. THANOS (INTO COM) Daughter? BAD NEBULA (OVER COM) Yes, father... OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA. Bruised and dirty. THANOS So this is the future. Well done. She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE. BAD NEBULA Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing. THANOS The arrogant never do.  Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge. THANOS (CONT'D) Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me. BAD NEBULA What will you do? THANOS Wait. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED. SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS. BELOW... RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING. RHODEY Canopy! Canopy! Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN. HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE. AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... THE CEILING RUMBLES. SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING. RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody hear me?! HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET. Rocket wheezes, in pain. RHODEY (CONT'D) Hang on! RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES, finally managing to lever it off of Rocket. THEN... THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY. A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER WATER RUSH IN. RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER. RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Mayday! We are taking on water! INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.  RHODEY (OVER COM) ...anyone...Mayday...MaydayScott groans, coming to. SCOTT LANG Wait, what...? REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE IRON PATRIOT HELMET. ROCKET (OVER COM) Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses upRHODEY (OVER COM) ...trapped...drowning...no time... Scott jumps to his feet. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) No! Wait, I’m here! Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR. INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN. He groans. He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN. “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.” Clint stares, amazed. He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET. It’s bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM. CLINT BARTON (INTO COM) Cap? Stark? Anyone? STATIC. Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT. He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow. HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING. CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS. THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE. INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM. He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD. TONY You lose this again, I’m keeping it. STEVE What happened? TONY Told you. We messed with time. Time messed back. Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab. STEVE Where are the others? TONY I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell. They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT...THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting. TONY (CONT'D) What’s he been doing? THOR Absolutely nothing. The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY. STEVE Son of a bitch. TONY Yeah. STEVE Where are the stones? TONY Somewhere under all of this. All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em. STEVE So we keep it that way. That lands. This is their chance. THOR You know it’s a trap. TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.  (MORE)  TONY Don’t think I care. THOR Just so we’re all in agreement. Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT. He holds out his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM. CRACK! LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR. THOR (CONT'D) Let’s kill him properly this time. STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative. THANOS You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Right back to me. TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG. STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE. THANOS (CONT'D) I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. (beat) Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails. As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be. They will resist. TONY Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn. THANOS I’m thankful. Because now I know what I must do. Thanos reaches for his helmet. THANOS (CONT'D) I will shred this universe down to its last atom. (MORE)  THANOS (CONT'D)And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe. STEVE Born out of blood. Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time. THANOS They’ll never know it. THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM. THANOS (CONT'D) Because you won’t be alive to tell them. Tony glances over at Steve. Ready? Steve nods... JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT. THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS. THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, RELENTLESS. PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2... INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL. After a beat...THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN. She stares into the shadows. NEBULA What do you want? GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL. THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER. GAMORA In the future...what happens to you and me? NEBULA I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually...we become friends. We become sisters. GAMORA That’s hard to believe. THANOS (CONT'D)  NEBULA A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe. Gamora nearly smiles. She takes a long look at Nebula. Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND. GAMORA Come on. We can still stop him. Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S HAND. One sister pulls the other to her feet. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING. RHODEY HANGS ONTO A PIPE AS THE WATER RISES. SMART HULK Rhodey. Rocket. Get out of here. Save yourselves. ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING. ROCKET No good. Couldn’t even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through. Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT. His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight. Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS. SMART HULK AAARRRGH! EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS. AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP. RHODEY (OVER COM) MAYDAY! MAYDAY! SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) HANG ON! I’M COMING!  INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS. CLINT AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS. Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS. Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT. A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him. Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides. Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as... INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER. He gasps, safe. Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM. CLINT BARTON Oh, hey. I know you. She gently takes the Gauntlet. BAD NEBULA (INTO COM) Father. I have the stones. CLINT BARTON WhatClint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD... GAMORA (O.S.) Stop. COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED. BAD NEBULA You’re betraying us? GAMORA Not you. GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating. Bad Nebula stares at her future self.  NEBULA You don’t have to do this. BAD NEBULA I am this. GAMORA No. You’re not. Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward. She taps her head. NEBULA You’ve seen what we becomeGAMORA Sister, listen to herBAD NEBULA Shut up. You’re a traitor! NEBULA You can change. Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace. BAD NEBULA He won’t let me. BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN AND SHOOTS HER DOWN. BAD NEBULA DROPS. Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused. CLINT BARTON I’m not even gonna ask. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS... THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT. TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST. THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS... THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER. WHACK! MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT. TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD. TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM. FRIDAY (O.S.) Boss? Wake up! INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE CEILING, FACING THE END. RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK. RHODEY See you on the other side, man. They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Steve slashes at Thanos. The Titan brutally bats him aside. Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris. THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER. Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it. He presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home. Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR. THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND. Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS. Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR. THOR I...knew...it... STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW. THANOS TUMBLES. BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY. Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS. THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE. HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE. BLOW AFTER BLOW. IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP.  THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE ACROSS THE FIELD. Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm. THANOS In all my years of conquest... Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand. THANOS (CONT'D) Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal. Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES. THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS. THANOS (CONT'D) But I’ll tell you now, the things I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet... Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE. THANOS (CONT'D) I’m going to enjoy it. Very, very much. Steve stares at Thanos and his army. And even in the face of such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet. THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM. One man against thousands. All alone. But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES. He strains to hear. The com crackles again. We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE. MUFFLED VOICE (ON COM) -ap-...-comin-...-otSteve shakes his head, trying to clear it. Slowly, SOUND RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR: SAM WILSON (O.S.) Cap. On your left. PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE. OUT OF IT FLIES...SAM WILSON. Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN MORE PORTALS OPEN. FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS. FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY. FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY. FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS. THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry. Wong and Strange quickly find each other. DR. STRANGE Is that everyone? WONG You wanted more?! JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW. SCOTT LANG Top floor, everybody out! HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR. STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS. PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND. STEVE Avengers...assemble. THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES! EVERYONE FOLLOWS SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD. ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE. TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH! GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW. DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life out of KORG.  TONY blasts overhead. RESCUE joins him. Together, they strafe the field. STEVE and THOR fight together. Both hold out their hands. Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns. THOR No. You take the little one. Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS. One knocks him into an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when... THWIP. PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT. SQUISH. Tony stares at Peter, emotional. They retract their helmets. PETER PARKER Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.” And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he doesBut Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s face into his chest plate. PETER PARKER (CONT'D) (muffled) Oh. This is nice. ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers. One leaps off an outcropping... TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER SAKAARAN WAITS. Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike. THEN BLAM! The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill. He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING. Quill stares, amazed. QUILL Gamora? HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL.  QUILL (CONT'D) I thought I lost you. He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts. Twice. He goes down, gasping. QUILL (CONT'D) You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time. She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER. GAMORA This is the one? Seriously? NEBULA Your choices were him or a tree. ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A CHITAURI APE. Just before the ape tramples Clint... SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN. Clint runs on. The heroes confer over coms. CLINT BARTON What do you want to do with this thing? STEVE Get those stones as far away as possible! SMART HULK No! We need to send them back where they came from. TONY There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine. SCOTT LANG Hold on! (shrinking to normal size) That wasn’t our only time machine. He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN. From a distance, we hear, “LA CUCARACHA.” Steve immediately gets it. STEVE Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there? ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.  VALKYRIE Yeah. But you’re not going to like where it’s parked. LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES. STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES. TONY (INTO COM) Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working? SCOTT LANG Uh, maybe ten minutes. STEVE Get it started. We’ll get the stones to you. HOPE VAN DYNE We’re on it, Cap. SCOTT glances at her. Cap? THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY. TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING. TONY Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down? DR. STRANGE If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen. TONY You better be right. Tony rockets away. Strange coolly watches him go. ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS. EBONY MAW Sire, the stones! THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, CARRYING THE GAUNTLET. A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL. T’CHALLA Clint, give it to me. CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS. ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN. INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat. Out the windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS. SCOTT LANG (digging around) Ignition’s broken. I’ll hotwire itHOPE VAN DYNE Wait, you know how to do that? Scott splices wires. Sparks fly. SCOTT LANG I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS FEET. THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING. AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS TO FLOAT. THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE... WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM. WANDA You took everything from me. Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back. THANOS I don’t even know who you are. WANDA You will. WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT HIM. AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT... T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET. SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM. T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.PETER PARKER (O.S.) I GOT IT! T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST. HE HURLS THE GAUNTLET...THWIP! Peter snatches it out of the air. HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS. PETER PARKER (CONT'D) Activate instant kill! His robotic arms slash with expert precision. ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND. Thanos groans, outmatched. THANOS (INTO COM) Rain fire. Wipe them all out. CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT. CORVUS GLAIVE But, sire, our troopsTHANOS (INTO COM) Just do it! HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP. BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS. SAKAARANS AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT. THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK. CRACKS FORM. PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN. PEPPER POTTS (INTO COM) Um, is anyone else seeing this? TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE. SUDDENLY... STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP THE BANK. MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.” THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE. ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders.  PETER PARKER I got this...I got this...I don’t got this. STEVE Hey, Queens! Heads up! STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG. PETER WEBS ON...LETTING THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER. A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS RESCUES HIM. PEPPER POTTS Hang on, kid. I’ve got you. She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE FLYING PAST. PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS. PETER PARKER Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg! VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH. A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND. HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR HEROES. ALL HOPE IS LOST. Rocket and Groot dive for cover. Groot wraps his branches around them both. ROCKET At least we’re going out together this time... SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT. ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS. SAM WILSON flies overhead. SAM WILSON What the hell is this? TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD. TONY Friday, what are they firing at? FRIDAY (O.S.) Something just entered the upper atmosphere.  Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH. GROOT (nervous) I am Groot. Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming. ROCKET Just wait for it. SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP. BOOM! THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS. ROCKET (CONT'D) Oh, yeah! CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN THROUGH THE HULL. BOOM! THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING. CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING. STEVE (OVER COM) Danvers! We’re gonna need an assist down here! CAROL DANVERS (INTO COM) (under ragged breath) Roger...Rogers... INT. VAN - DAY Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) I’m almost there. Where’s the glove? EXT. CRATER - DAY CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS THE GAUNTLET TIGHT. HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED. PETER PARKER Uh, hey. I’m Peter Parker. CAROL DANVERS Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?  Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde. PETER PARKER I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all thatWANDA (O.S.) Don’t worry, kid... Peter turns to see... WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI WAITING. Wanda’s hands begin to glow. OKOYE She’s got help. Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT. AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING THROUGH HIS TROOPS. HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN. SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL. SCOTT LANG Thirty seconds! Thanos understands immediately. HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING... ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY. CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT. CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO... THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE. ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH. BUT JUST AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS... THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR... BOOM! THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER. THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR. TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT. The problem is...SO DOES THANOS. TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES. THEY COLLIDE. THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN. THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE. STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR, THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP... CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE. CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS... THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING. THE FIELD GOES QUIET. NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY. Tony gets to his knees, realizing... The Avengers are going to lose. ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER. STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE. He looks to Tony... Tony meets his eye. And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger. “One.” ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE GAUNTLET. JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM... TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING IT IN A VISE. THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE. HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT. THANOS I am...inevitable. THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. But nothing happens. Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST: COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES. POWER SURGES THROUGH TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND... TONY And I...am Iron Man. SNAP! WHOOSH. THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING. THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR. SHIPS VANISH FROM THE SKY. CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY... LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE. AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE. He watches as... HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE. FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS. ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE. QUILL Babe? Gamora? ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED. Dying. RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO LATE. TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO. Then... PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand. PETER PARKER Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir... But Tony gazes past him. Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder, guiding him away... AS PEPPER ARRIVES. She kneels, heartsick. PEPPER POTTS Hey, Friday, what’ve we got? FRIDAY (O.S.) Life functions critical. Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows.  (MORE) PEPPER POTTS Tony, look at me. We’re going to be okay... He stares at her, tears welling. I’m sorry. She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him. PEPPER POTTS (CONT'D) You can rest now. When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy. Everything goes quiet. All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what’s happened dawning on them. Tony Stark is gone. FADE TO BLACK. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students. He searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS. As they embrace... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco. TONY (O.S.) Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way. Maybe this time. On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning. EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE. Then the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out. TONY (O.S.) I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration. (MORE)  TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) (MORE)  I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky. EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA. Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset. TONY (O.S.) God, what a world. Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised. But come on... EXT BARTON HOME - DAY The Quinjet touches down. The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT. He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed. TONY (O.S.) Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. They throw themselves into his arms. He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes. Finally, he looks up to see... LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL’S HAND. Clint gathers them all into a hug. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table. TONY (O.S.) That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part. TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) (MORE)  TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)  I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all. But that’s the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end. REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching. TONY (CONT'D) What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to. HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and Morgan in particular. TONY (CONT'D) I love you 3000. He switches off the camera, vanishing. Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS. The Avengers follow, somber. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER. CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.” Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN... PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA... PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL... PAST THOR AND SMART HULK... PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE... PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY... PAST T’CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)  PAST STRANGE and WONG... PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET... PAST BUCKY BARNES... PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER... PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY. THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake. WANDA approaches. CLINT BARTON I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it. WANDA She knows. They both do. Clint puts his arm around her. They stare out at the water. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND. HAPPY HOGAN How are you doing, squirt? You hungry? MORGAN STARK Uh, huh. HAPPY HOGAN What do you want? MORGAN STARK Cheeseburgers? Happy takes a beat, choked up. Like father like daughter. HAPPY HOGAN Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers? MORGAN STARK No, I didn’t know that.   HAPPY HOGAN I’m going to get you all the cheeseburgers you want. EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD. VALKYRIE So when can we expect you back? THOR About that... VALKYRIE Thor, your people need a king. THOR They already have one. And she’s a far better king than I could ever be. VALKYRIE Are you serious? THOR It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be. And a leader is who you are. She processes this. Does she want it? She does. VALKYRIE You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here. THOR I’m counting on it, Your Majesty. Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND. VALKYRIE What will you do? THOR I’m not entirely sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. (beat) But I do have a ride. REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside.   ROCKET Move it or lose it, Hairbag. INT. BENATAR - DAY THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar. QUILL, MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines. THOR Home sweet home. Tree! Good to see you. The Asgardians of the Galaxy, together again. He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. THOR (CONT'D) All right, where first? He swipes through images on the screen. QUILL You know, I’m still in charge, here, right? THOR Of course. Of course... Thor swipes the map again. QUILL See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-” THOR Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up. DRAX You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. NEBULA Sounds fair. QUILL That’s not necessary... ROCKET I’ve got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives.   MANTIS Oh, yes, please, use knivesQUILL No one’s using knives! GROOT I am Groot! Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter. THOR There’ll be no knifing young Quail today. Everyone knows who’s in charge. A long awkward moment passes. QUILL Me. (sotto, to Thor) Right? Thor just smiles... EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY The ship rises. WHOOSH. IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND. A COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0). As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments. He finally opens A CASE: THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE. SMART HULK Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities. STEVE Got it. I’ll clip all the branches.   Steve takes the case. SMART HULK You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back. (beat) I miss her. STEVE Me, too. SMART HULK You’d better get going. We’re almost ready for you. Steve and Sam approach the platform. SAM WILSON You look a little nervous going by yourself. Ask nicely, I’ll go with you. STEVE You’re a good man, Sam. But this one’s on me. When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed. STEVE (CONT'D) Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay? BUCKY BARNES How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you. Steve grins. Bucky gives him a long hug. BUCKY BARNES (CONT'D) Gonna miss you, buddy. STEVE It’s going to be okay, Buck. Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform. SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE. SAM WILSON How long’s this gonna take?   SMART HULK For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. (calling out) Ready, Cap? You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay? Steve glances at Bucky as he answers. STEVE You bet. SMART HULK Going Quantum in three, two, one. STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...oneSilence. Nothing happens. SAM WILSON Where is he? SMART HULK I don’t know. He blew past our time stamp. He should be here. SAM WILSON Get him back! SMART HULK I’m trying. SAM WILSON Get him the hell backSMART HULK I’M TRYING! Just then...Bucky looks out to the water. BUCKY BARNES Sam. Sam turns... EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river. There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.   Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY. SAM WILSON Hey, Cap. The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112. OLD STEVE Hi, Sam. SAM WILSON Something go wrong...or something go right? OLD STEVE I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get. SAM WILSON How was it? Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face. OLD STEVE It was beautiful. SAM WILSON I’m happy for you. Really. OLD STEVE Thanks. SAM WILSON Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America. Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam. OLD STEVE That’s kind of why I’m here. Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD. SAM WILSON Where did you even get this? OLD STEVE I had a little time to travel. (beat) Try it on.   Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods. Then Sam picks up the shield...and puts it on. OLD STEVE (CONT'D) How does it feel? SAM WILSON Like it’s someone else’s. OLD STEVE It isn’t. Sam tries to check his emotion. He shakes Steve’s hand. SAM WILSON Thank you. I’ll try my best. Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s. OLD STEVE That’s why it’s yours. Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING. SAM WILSON You gonna tell me about her? Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life. OLD STEVE Nope. I don’t think I will. CUE MUSIC: “IT’S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME,” HARRY JAMES. EXT. COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A PACKARD rolls down a block of WASHINGTON D.C. ROW HOUSES. TITLE: “WASHINGTON D.C., 1949.” Find a red house in the middle of the block. Move up the steps to the front door...WHICH HANGS WIDE OPEN. INT. RED HOUSE, COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood. We hear Harry James. Move into the living room...past the record player... TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN. They rock back and forth barely moving. As they turn, we see...   PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face. He steps on her toe. She laughs. As they turn, we get a good look at... Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he deserves. THE END.

Avengers: Infinity War
By Christopher Markus

This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.
We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.
Aliens are dead, sliced open...
Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...
Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.
This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.
Hear me... and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile
for even in death
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right,
yet to fail nonetheless.
As lightning
turns the legs to jelly.
I ask you
to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
Destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or, your brother's head.
I assume you have a preference?
Oh, I do.
Kill away.

All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are the worst, brother.
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Forefathers...
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You are going to die for that!
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being, has
ever had the might,
nay, the nobility,
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The Universe,
lies within your grasp.
There are two more
Stones on Earth.
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.
If you consider failure experience.
I consider experience, experience.
Almighty Thanos.
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...
Odin-son...
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

God of Mischief...
Do hereby pledge to you,
my undying fidelity.
"Undying"?
You should choose your
words more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No resurrections this time.
No... Loki...
Seriously? You don't
have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.
Thanos is coming.
We've got to...
Who?
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Yeah.
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Everybody has that.
Right. That's the point

I'm trying to make.
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.
So real.
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.
So you woke up,
and we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...
You wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.
Shirts.
You know me so well.
You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah. You know what
there should be?
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.
- Yeah.
- I will.
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?
We need your help.
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.
And who's "we"?
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!
You okay?
From the dawn of the Universe,
there was nothing.
Then, boom!
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,
hurdling across the virgin Universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York. That's him.
- What's our time line?
- No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones,
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what that is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.
A bit chalky.
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!
Only if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.
And we have to find him now.
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.
What?
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.
Maybe. But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
I might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit!
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me, and rejoice!
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful, that your meaningless

lives are now contributing to...
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stone keeper...
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?
Certainly not. I speak for myself.
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.
Bring me the Stone.
Hey, do you want a piece?
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.
Come on, come on, Max.
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye!
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Come on, Hulk. What

are you doing?
Come on. Come on! Come on!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
The field trip.
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.
You'll only wish you were dead.
No!
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!
Not cool.
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice, Friday.
Unlock 17-A.
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said save the wizard!
I can't breathe!
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.
That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know how to say this. Pep...
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!
Come back!
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...
Oh, my God.
I should have stayed on the bus.
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!
You got some acorns on you, kid.
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like we're
not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
How the hell is this
dude still alive?
He is not a dude. You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious. Angry.
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?

The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.
Thanos can be tough.
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.
It's life, there was nothing else.
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.
I need a hammer, not a spoon...
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?
Taking your pod.
No, you're not!

You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!
This is my voice!
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
You just did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.
Nowhere.
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
- Thor...
Why would he go to nowhere?
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,
there with a man
we call the collector.
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.
Or a genius.
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There's six stones out there.
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone from me.
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.
Haven't been there in a while.
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not going to...
Wait, what kind of weapon

are we talking about here?
The Thanos killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?
A little bit. Yeah.
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
I got it figured out.
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know.
Something...
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow
to give us more time together

before you went back.
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.
What if I missed all the trains?
What if this time,
I didn't go back?
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda...
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.
Stay.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone was
warning me about.
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.
Wanda, I...
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
Vis!
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.
We have to go.
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.
I'm staying.
- Get up.
- I can't.

We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
I thought
we had a deal.
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.
Come. Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be.
Too much to one side,
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.
Concentrate.
There! You've got it.
Gamora.
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.
Which is what the
grenades are for.
I'm sorry. What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
If he finds it out...
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know, too.
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?
- An hour.
- An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...
So slow...
- And it's imperceptible.

- No.
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.
Let's put it down over here.
I know you have the Reality Stone.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you. I sold it.
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.
Last chance, Charlotte.
Where's the Stone?
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait!
Whoa, not yet!
He doesn't have the Stone yet.
We get it, and then
we can stop him.
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.
I'm... The other right!
Why?
Why you? Daughter...
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Is it sadness I sense

in you, daughter?
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.
No one ever knows for sure.
Reality is often disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
Reality can be whatever I want.
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...
- I told you to go right.
- Now...
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter...
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!
Not him.
You promised!
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Do it!
I told you to go right!
I love you, more than anything.
I love you, too.
I like you.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.
You know they're only criminals
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use some
of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think, all is forgiven?
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
We'll fight you, too.
- Arrest them.
- All over it.
That's a court-martial.
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.
Must've been a rough
couple of years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
I think you look great.
Yeah. I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look...
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...
Vision's stone.
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.
But also, its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently
powerful energy
source, something,
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...
Its molecular
integrity could fail.
And you, with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.
Only you, have the
power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.
But it should.

We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.
Tell me, why is
this any different?
Because you might have a choice.
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?
Not me. Not here.
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time I
have served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...
There would be judgment.

Give me...
the Stone.
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.
Speaking of loyalty...
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...
And now I gotta hear it.
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now I'm here in space.
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.
Okay, okay.
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.
I gotta tell you, he's

not really my friend.
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes!
Wait, what are those?
Hey, we haven't officially met.
Cool.
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.
Great, I want to protect the stone.
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.
I tried to bench
you, you refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,
billions of miles from Earth,
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.
I'm Spider-Man, then.
The ship is self-correcting its course.

Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it? Fly us home?
- Stark.
- Yeah?
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.
I'm not so sure we should.
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark. We go to him.
But you have to understand...
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.
Nice. Good. Moral compass.
All right, kid...
You're an Avenger now.
I thought you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room, this ship...

I hated my life.
You told me that, too.
Everyday.
For almost twenty years.
I was a child when you took me.
I saved you.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
You know what's happened since then?
The children born, have
known nothing but full
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to
pay for salvation.
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!
I'm the only one who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
You...
had that same will,
as you fought by my side,
daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula!
Don't do this.
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.
So, I brought her here...
to talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you, on my life...
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know what he's about to do.
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me...
The generous... me...
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir.
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.
I am Groot!
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space
then go in the cup again.

You speak Groot?
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.
It's the birthplace of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay. Time to be the captain.
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?
Absolutely!
The rage and vengeance, anger...
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and
every one of them
would've rather killed me
but none succeeded.

I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.
And what if you're wrong?
Well, if I'm wrong, then...
What more could I lose?
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.
Okay.
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...
Hey, we're here.
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
But it ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?
Did it look anything like that?
- I am Groot.

- Get back to the pod.
Eitri, wait! Stop!
Thor?
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, what did you do?
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
And he killed everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.
Every weapon you've
ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you to meet me on Titan.
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand inside this.
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens wind up

implanting eggs in my chest or something,
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.
Thanos!
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Die, Blanket of Death!
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...
Where is Gamora?
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.
She's right. You can't.
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...
Let me ask you this one time...
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

He took my girl. Wait, who are you?
We're the Avengers, man.
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.
Where is he now?
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.
Does it have a name?
Storm breaker.
Yeah. It's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart the forge.
Awaken the heart of the dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
What the hell happened
to this planet?
It's 8 degrees off its axis.
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

What exactly is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
All right, just get over here, please?
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?
Star-Lord is fine.
We've gotta coalesce.
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.
What dance-off?
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?
It never was.
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.
Excuse me?
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange! You all right?
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.
How many did we win?

One.
The Stone had
better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know,
it extracts a terrible price.
I'm prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.
Banished me here.
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.
What you seek lies
in front of you.
As does what you fear.
- What's this?
- The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure
whoever possesses it,
understands its power...
The Stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the Stone...
You must lose that
which you love.
A soul, for a soul.
All my life, I

dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But, now...
You kill, and torture,
and you call it mercy.
The Universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize and
and it told you, no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
Really? Tears?
They are not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even...
for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.
I hope you're right about this,
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.
What did you imagine?
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Sir, I think you should expect

quite a big assault.
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...
A semi-stable 100-year old man.
How have you been, Buck?
Not bad, for the
end of the world.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?
Because... we didn't think of it?
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.
God, I love this place.
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...
and get this man a shield!
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.

You wanna get them moving,
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir!
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...
I'm okay.
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.
Thank you for standing with us.
Of course, brother.
Where's the other friend?
He will pay for his
life with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.
We,
have blood to spare.
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

Yibambe!
Yibambe!
Yibambe!
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
See the teeth on those things?
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,
there's nothing between
them and Vision.
Then we better keep
them in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.
Requesting confirmation, my King.
You said open the barrier?
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Wakanda forever!
Now!
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.
You might want to
pick up the pace.
All fathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take the
full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
And if I die?
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.
Hold it, hold it, Thor!
Thor? Say something, come on.
Thor, you okay?
- I think he's dying.

- He needs the axe.
Where's the handle?
Tree! Help me find the handle.
There's too many of them!
You guys are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it that Maw is dead?
This day extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.
Where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess.
Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide?
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.
And they called me a madman.
And what I predicted,
came to pass.
Congratulations. You're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I finally rest.
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require

the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.
"Our"?
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic! More magic!
Magic with a kick!
Magic with a...
Insect.
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.
Would have been a
waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under? Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.
Not so strong now, huh?
Where's Gamora?
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!
Where is she?
- He is in anguish.
- Good.
He...
He mourns.
What does this monster
have to mourn?
Gamora...
What?
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole! Tell me

you didn't do it.
I had to...
No you didn't.
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Just stop! Stop!
It's coming, I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some, face-dogs!
Come on! Get some, get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay, how much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.
I am Groot!
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back now!
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.
On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself. Come on.
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were a formidable machine.
But you're dying, like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That's really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you, I got you!
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.
- Stark.
- You know me?
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.
No tricks.
Don't!
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.

Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap. That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda. It's time.
No.
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.
- Don't.
- You must. Please...
We are out of time.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now...
is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
You'd die for that.
You should have...
You...
You should have
gone for the head!
No!

Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
Where did he go?
Thor...
Where did he go?
Steve?
Up, General, up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot...
No.
No. No. No. No! Groot...
No...
Sam?
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening...
Quill?
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good...
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this? What the
hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Subbed by:
Search for Stark.
No not yet.
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching Stark over there.

- What is it?
- Multiple bogets from wakanda.
Same energy signatures
as in New York?
10 times bigger.
Call Clint. We'll meet him...
They okay?
There is no one here.
Call control.
Code RED.
Nick.
No!
Oh no!

[1991, a HYDRA base in a snowy landscape. A man enters a bunker and removes a red book marked with a black star.]
[A technician raises a cylindrical chamber, revealing Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier.]
[Bucky Barnes is secured in a chair, a mechanical device either side of his head causing him to scream in pain.]

Vasily Karpov: У меня есть для тебя миссия. Санкционируй и Извлекай. Без свидетелей.([subtitled] I have a mission for you. Sanction and extract. No witnesses.)
[Night. A car is driving down a dirt road alone. The Winter Soldier is waiting at the side of the road with his motorcycle. As the car passes, the Winter Soldier follows. He comes alongside the car and disables it. It slams into a tree. The Winter Soldier brings the motorcycle back around and climbs off. He walks to the car trunk and rips it open, revealing a silver case containing several blue packets]
[Back at the HYDRA base]
Vasily Karpov: Отлично, Солдат. ([subtitled] Well done, Soldier.)
[Marvel Opening Credits]
[Lagos, present day]
[Wanda Maximoff, aka Scarlet Witch, adds sugar to a cup and stirs it. She looks around.]
Steve Rogers: [on radio] All right, what do you see?
Wanda Maximoff: Standard beat cops. Small station. Quiet street. It’s a good target.
Steve Rogers: There’s an ATM in the south corner, which means . . .
Wanda Maximoff: Cameras.
Steve Rogers: Both cross streets are one way.
Wanda Maximoff: So, compromised escape routes.
Steve Rogers: Means our guy doesn't care about being seen, he isn't afraid to make a mess on the way out. You see that Range Rover halfway up the block?
Wanda Maximoff: Yeah, the red one? It’s cute.
[Camera pans to show Natasha sitting two tables from Wanda]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio] It's also bulletproof, which means private security, which means more guns, which means more headaches for somebody. Probably us.
Wanda Maximoff: You guys know I can move things with my mind, right?
Natasha Romanoff: Looking over your shoulder needs to become second nature.
Sam Wilson: Anybody ever tell you you're a little paranoid?
Natasha Romanoff: Not to my face. Why? Did you hear something?
Steve Rogers: Eyes on target, folks. This is the best lead we've had on Rumlow in six months. I don't want to lose him.
Sam Wilson: If he sees us coming that won't be a problem. He kind of hates us.
[A garbage truck is pushing its way through traffic, with no regard to pedestrians or other vehicles]
Steve Rogers: Sam, see that garbage truck? Tag it.
[From the back of Sam’s Falcon jet pack, a small drone, launches and flies down to scan the garbage truck.]
Sam Wilson: Give me X-ray.
[weight analysis: Cargo Weight: 13825 kgs. Max capacity.]
Sam Wilson: That truck’s loaded for max weight. And the driver’s armed.
Natasha Romanoff: It’s a battering ram.
Steve Rogers: Go now.
Wanda Maximoff: What?
Steve Rogers: He’s not hitting the police.
[INSTITUTE FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES]
[A man is sitting in the guard station. He looks over as the garbage truck is coming towards the gate. The driver jumps out, and the truck slams into the gateway. Two trucks rush into the compound through the newly-made entrance.]
[Soldiers in black armor emerge from the trucks, firing their rifles around the courtyard. Four soldiers fire gas canisters into the building. Soldiers wearing gas masks enter.]
[Steve arrives and takes out several of the soldiers.]
Steve Rogers: Body armor, AR-15's. I make seven hostiles.
[Sam flies in and up to a rooftop, spinning and using his wings to block gunfire. He takes out two soldiers.]
Sam Wilson: I make 5.
[Wanda arrives and flies over the rooftop and into the courtyard, blocking fire with her powers. She takes control of one soldier and lifts him upward.]
Wanda Maximoff: Sam.
[Sam glides down from the rooftop, catching the soldier on one of his wings.]
Sam Wilson: Four.
[Sam's drone flies by, scanning the inside of the building.]
Sam Wilson: Rumlow’s on the third floor.
Steve Rogers: Wanda, just like we practiced.
Wanda Maximoff: What about the gas?
Steve Rogers: Get it out.
[Wanda uses her powers to lift Steve up and through the window. He grabs a soldier and pulls off their gas mask]
[Rumlow is inside. He punches down the door. He knocks aside a technician and enters a room with a container labeled "bio-hazard."]
Brock Rumlow: Pack it up.
[In another area, Steve is behind a pillar. He throws his shield, and it bounces off the soldier and back to Steve. Meanwhile, Wanda is now using her powers to remove the gas from the building. Sam is exchanging fire with several soldiers.]
[Rumlow walks outside onto a balcony and sees that Steve’s team is here.]
Brock Rumlow: He’s here.
[Inside the building, Steve sees the vial missing.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow has a biological weapon.
[Natasha is riding in on a motorcycle.]
Natasha Romanoff: (on radio) I’m on it.
[She jumps off the motorcycle and it skids toward a soldier. She takes out soldiers through hand-to-hand combat. Rumlow comes up behind her and grabs her collar, dragging her onto an armored vehicle. She electrocutes him.]
Brock Rumlow: I don't work like that no more.
[He throws her through the roof hatch into an armored vehicle, drops in a grenade, and shuts the hatch.]
Brock Rumlow: Fire in the hole.
Mercenary: No!
[Natasha takes out the soldiers inside, then grabs one to shield herself from the grenade. The doors blow open and she is thrown out.]
[Steve runs out onto the balcony and spots Rumlow.]
Steve Rogers: Sam. He's in an AFV heading north.
[Inside the AFV, Rumlow secures the biological weapon and hands it to a soldier.]
Brock Rumlow: Take this to the airstrip. We're not gonna outrun them. Lose the truck.
[The truck crashes into a nearby structure and Rumlow and the soldiers emerge.]
Mercenary #1: Where are you going to meet us?
Brock Rumlow: I’m not.
[Sam lands on the roof of a structure. He scans the area with his goggles.]
Sam Wilson: I got four, they're splitting up.
[Natasha rides through the crowd, back on her motorcycle. She abandons it again and runs across the hoods of cars, in pursuit.]
Natasha Romanoff: I got the two on the left.
[Steve is also running across cars. He spots a vest in the middle of a crowd.]
Steve Rogers: They ditched their gear. It's a shell game now. One of them has the payload.
[Someone throws a bomb at Steve. It sticks on his shield. Steve throws it in the air and the bomb detonates safely away from citizens. Rumlow comes up behind Steve and punches him in the back.]
Brock Rumlow: There you are, you son of a bitch. I’ve been waiting for this!
[Meanwhile, Sam is still chasing the other mercenaries. Sam flies up and takes out his two, then searches their bags for the payload.]
Sam Wilson: He doesn't have it. I’m empty.
[Natasha is chasing the soldiers through the crowd.]
Natasha Romanoff: Out of the way!
[She tackles one soldier and engages him in combat. When the other soldier arrives, she hurls a basket at him to distract him. She uses her skills to fight them and ends up face-to-face with one soldier. They point their guns at each other. A moment passes. Then, the other soldier produces the vial.]
Mercenary #1: Drop it. Or I’ll drop this. Drop it!
Mercenary #2: He'll do it!
[Redwing descends and fires at the soldier with the vial. He drops, and in the moment of distraction, Natasha fires at the other soldier, then catches the falling vial.]
Natasha Romanoff: Payload secure. Thanks, Sam.
Sam Wilson: Don't thank me.
Natasha Romanoff: I’m… not thanking that thing.
Sam Wilson: His name is Redwing.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm still not thanking it.
Sam Wilson: He's cute. Go ahead, pet him.
[Steve and Rumlow are still fighting, neither one seeming to have the upper hand.]
Brock Rumlow: Come on!
[Rumlow pins Steve to a building and extends a blade from one of his gauntlets.]
Brock Rumlow: This is for dropping a building on my face.
[Steve grabs Rumlow's arm and pulls the gauntlet off, only for Rumlow to reveal another knife. But Steve bests him. Defeated, on his knees, Rumlow removes his mask, revealing a scarred face.]
Brock Rumlow: I think I look pretty good, all things considered.
Steve Rogers: Who's your buyer?
Brock Rumlow: You know, he knew you. You pal, your buddy, your Bucky.
Steve Rogers: What did you say?
Brock Rumlow: He remembered you. I was there. He got all weepy about it. Till they put his brain back in a blender. He wanted you to know something. He said to me, "Please tell Rogers. When you gotta go, you gotta go." And you're coming with me.
[He activates his bomb vest and Steve flinches as Rumlow's armor ignites, but Wanda keeps the blast contained around Rumlow who grimaces in agony. She lifts him into the air before she loses control, and the explosion finally blossoms, devastating entire floors of a nearby office building. Wanda sees what happened and is scarred by it.]
Steve Rogers: Oh my . . . [Steve stares up.] Sam . . . We need . . . Fire and Rescue . . . on the south side of the building. We gotta get up there.
[Soft piano is playing. Tony Stark's mother, Maria, sits at a piano. A young Tony is on the couch.]
Maria Stark: Try to remember the kind of September. When grass was green . . . [She stops singing as Howard Stark walks in, but continues playing.] Wake up, dear, and say goodbye to your father.
Howard Stark: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
[Tony, wearing a Santa hat, staggers to his feet and chuckles.]
Young Tony Stark: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
Maria Stark: Be nice, dear, he's been studying abroad.
Howard Stark: Really, which broad? What's her name?
Young Tony Stark: Candice.
[Howard pulls of Tony's hat.]
Howard Stark: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
Young Tony Stark: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
Maria Stark: Your father's flying us to the Bahamas for a little getaway.
Howard Stark: We might have to make a quick stop.
Young Tony Stark: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
[Maria stops playing the piano.]
Howard Stark: You know, they say sarcasm is a metric for potential. If that's true, you'll be a great man some day. I'll get the bags.
[He walks out of the room, and Maria stands up.]
Maria Stark: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
[Howard walks back in.]
Young Tony Stark: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
[Maria leans in to kiss Tony on the cheek, and when she leans back, an older Tony Stark is standing in the background. Howard and Maria walk out, leaving the two Tonys.]
Tony Stark: That's how I wished it happened. Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing, or BARF. God, I gotta work on that acronym. An extremely costly method of hijacking the hippocampus to . . . clear traumatic memories. Huh.
[He blows on a candle and everything around him shimmers, then starts to dissolve. It's a hologram.]
Tony Stark: It doesn't change the fact that they never made it to the airport . . . or all the things I did to avoid processing my grief, but . . . [He takes off his glasses.] Plus, 611 million dollars for my little therapeutic experiment? No one in the right mind would've ever funded it.
[He is standing on a stage in front of a large crowd. A sign reads MIT Alumni Honors: Tony Stark.]
Tony Stark: Help me out, what's the MIT mission statement? "To generate, disseminate . . . and preserve knowledge. And work with others . . . to bring it to bear on the world's great challenges." Well, you are the others. And, quiet as it's kept . . . the challenges facing you are the greatest mankind's ever known. Plus, most of you are broke.
[The crowd chuckles.]
Tony Stark: Oh, I'm sorry. Rather, you were. As of this moment . . . every student has been made an equal recipient of the Inaugural September Foundation Grant. As in . . . all of your projects have just been approved and funded.
[The crowd breaks out in applause and cheering.]
Tony Stark: No strings, no taxes… just re-frame the future! Starting now.
[The teleprompter above the audience reads. 'Now I would like to introduce the head of the foundation: Pepper Potts.' Tony stares at it sadly.]
Tony Stark: Go break some eggs.
[He exits the stage.]
MIT teacher: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
[Tony is not listening.]
Tony Stark: Restroom's this way, yeah?
MIT teacher: Yeah. Embedded in the meat shaft.
Stark's Assistant: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
Tony Stark: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
MIT teacher: We'll catch up later.
[Tony steps into a quiet corridor. He loiters by the men's room, then glances back at the stage door before walking towards the elevator. A woman in sober clothes is also waiting. Tony stops and turns his back to the wall.]
Mrs. Spencer: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
Tony Stark: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
Mrs. Spencer: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
[He narrows his eyes and half smiles, then turns to face the elevator. He looks surprised to find the button unlit and pushes it himself.]
Tony Stark: Are you going up?
Mrs. Spencer: I'm right where I want to be.
[She digs in her handbag, Tony grabs her wrist. He realizes what he's done.]
Tony Stark: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
Mrs. Spencer: I work for the State Department. Human Resources. I know it's boring . . . but it enabled me to raise a son. I'm very proud of what he grew up to be.
[She shoves a photo at him.]
Mrs Spencer: His name was Charlie Spencer. You murdered him. In Sokovia. Not that it matters in the least to you. You think you fight for us. You just fight for yourself.
[Tony shakes his head.]
Mrs Spencer: Who's going to avenge my son, Stark? He's dead . . . and I blame you.
[She turns and walks away, leaving Tony standing by the elevator with a grim frown.]
[At the Avengers Compound. Steve catches Wanda watching a news report on the Lagos attack and how they blame her for it.]
News Anchor #1: 11 Wakandans were among those killed during a confrontation between the Avengers and a group of mercenaries in Lagos, Nigeria, last month. The traditionally reclusive Wakandans were on an outreach mission in Lagos when the attack occurred.
King T'Chaka: Our people's blood is spilled on foreign soil. Not only because of the actions of criminals, but by the indifference of those pledged to stop them. Victory at the expense of the innocent, is no victory at all.
News Anchor #1: The Wakanda king went on to . . .
[Steve, who was watching the news, turns his computer off, but sound drifts toward him from another room.]
News anchor #2: They are operating outside and above the international law. Because that's the reality, if we don't respond to acts like these.
[Wanda is sitting on her bed, watching the news on her TV.]
News Anchor #2 What legal authority does an enhanced individual like Wanda Maximoff have to operate in Nigeri -
[The TV turns off. Steve sets the remote down and leans on the door frame.]
Wanda Maximoff: It's my fault.
Steve Rogers: That's not true.
Wanda Maximoff: Turn the TV back on. They're being very specific.
Steve Rogers: I should've clocked that bomb vest long before you had to deal with it.
[He walks over.]
Steve Rogers: Rumlow said "Bucky" and . . . all of a sudden I was a 16-year-old kid again, in Brooklyn. [He sits beside Wanda.]
Steve Rogers: And people died. It's on me.
Wanda Maximoff: It's on both of us.
Steve Rogers: This job . . . we try to save as many people as we can. Sometimes that doesn't mean everybody. But if we can't find a way to live with that, next time . . . maybe nobody gets saved.
[Vision materializes through the wall. Wanda starts.]
[Vision interrupts Wanda and Steve by walking through the wall into Wanda’s room]
Wanda Maximoff: Vis! We talked about this.
Vision: Yes, but the door was open so I assumed that . . .
[He gestures at the door and stops.]
Vision: Captain Rogers wished to know when Mr. Stark was arriving.
Steve Rogers: Thank you. We'll be right down.
Vision: I'll . . . use the door. Oh, and apparently, he's brought a guest.
Steve Rogers: We know who it is?
Vision: The Secretary of State.
[The Secretary of State, Thaddeus Ross, is standing at the head of a table. Rhodey, Natasha, Steve, Tony, Sam, Vision, and Wanda are gathered around.]
[The Secretary of State Thaddeus Ross has summoned the Avengers to a meeting]
Secretary Ross: Five years ago, I had a heart attack. I dropped right in the middle of my back-swing. Turned out it was the best round of my life, because after 13 hours of surgery and a triple bypass . . . I found something 40 years in the Army had never taught me: Perspective. The world owes the Avengers an un-payable debt. You have fought for us, protected us, risked your lives . . . but while a great many people see you as heroes, there are some . . . who would prefer the word "vigilantes".
Natasha Romanoff: And what word would you use, Mr. Secretary?
Secretary Ross: How about "dangerous"? What would you call a group of US-based, enhanced individuals who routinely ignore sovereign borders and inflict their will wherever they choose and who, frankly, seem unconcerned about what they leave behind?
[Ross activates a screen behind him. News footage from past Avengers and SHIELD matters flash on the screen as he speaks.]
Secretary Ross: New York.
[A Chitauri leviathan. Terrified citizens. A soldier firing a gun. The Hulk smashes into a building and sends a dust cloud to engulf the camera.]
[Rhodey looks regretful. He glances behind him at Natasha.]
Secretary Ross: Washington DC.
[The three Insight helicarriers, firing on each other. The destroyed Triskelion. A helicarrier crashing into the Potomac and throwing up a massive wave, engulfing citizens and the camera.]
[Sam looks down.]
Secretary Ross: Sokovia.
[Terrified citizens, running. The city rising. A building falling over.]
[Wanda stares at the screen, as does Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Lagos.
[The burning building. Paramedics moving a body. A dead girl.]
[Wanda is particularly affected by the footage from Lagos. Steve sees this and intervenes.]
Steve Rogers: Okay. That's enough.
[Secretary Ross nods to an aide and the images disappear.]
Secretary Ross: For the past four years, you've operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. [he places a thick document on the desk and passes it to Wanda]
[An aide hands him a thick book, which Ross slides across the table to Wanda. She picks it up, then slides it to Rhodey.]
Secretary Ross: The Sokovia Accords. Approved by 117 countries . . . it states that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations panel, only when and if that panel deems it necessary.
Steve Rogers: The Avengers were formed to make the world a safer place. I feel we've done that.
Secretary Ross: Tell me, Captain, do you know where Thor and Banner are right now?
[Steve looks up and meets Ross's eyes.]
Secretary Ross: If I misplaced a couple of 30 megaton nukes . . . you can bet there'd be consequences. Compromise. Reassurance. That's how the world works. Believe me, this is the middle ground.
James Rhodes: So, there are contingencies.
Secretary Ross: Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the Accords.
[Steve glances at Tony.]
Secretary Ross: Talk it over.
Natasha Romanoff: And if we come to a decision you don't like?
Secretary Ross: Then you retire.
[Natasha stifles a smile.]
[Cleveland.]
[Vasily Karpov sits, eating at the table in a cluttered house. He hears the sound of something crashing outside and peers through drawn blinds. Outside, Helmut Zemo stands by his car, the front end crumpled against Karpov's car.]
Helmut Zemo: Hello? Is this your car out front?
[Zemo comes to the door.]
Helmut Zemo: I jumped the curb.
[Karpov eyes his gun nearby.]
Helmut Zemo: Maybe we could take care of it ourselves. If you wanna call the cops, tha--that's okay too, I guess.
Vasily Karpov: No. No cops.
Helmut Zemo: Thank you.
[Karpov slides a heavy duty lock and opens the door. Zemo punches him.]
[Zemo is using a sledgehammer to smash a hole in the wall. He retrieves a large box from inside the hole and tips the contents onto a table. Karpov is hanging upside down, tied to pipes in his basement. There are various documents and the red book with the star on the cover. He holds the red book for a moment then opens a file. Inside is a photo of Karpov in his military uniform and beret.]
Helmut Zemo: You have kept your looks, Colonel. Congratulations.
[Karpov's head is in a sink, which is filling with water.]
Helmut Zemo: "Mission report: December 16, 1991."
Vasily Karpov: Who are you?
Helmut Zemo: My name is Zemo. I will repeat my question. Mission report. December 16, 1991.
Vasily Karpov: How did you find me?
Helmut Zemo: When SHIELD fell, Black Widow released HYDRA files to the public. Millions of pages much of it encrypted, not easy to decipher. But . . . I have experience. And patience. A man can do anything if he has those.
Vasily Karpov: What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16. 1991.
Vasily Karpov: Go . . . to . . . hell.
[Zemo goes to lean on the sink as water continues to flow into it. He turns off the tap and studies Karpov's upside down face.]
Helmut Zemo: HYDRA deserves its place on the ash heap. So your death would not bother me. But I'd have to use this book . . . and other bloodier methods to find what I need. I don't look forward to that. You'd only be dying for . . . your pride.
[Zemo stares at Karpov then nods resignedly. He turns the tap back on. The water is up to Karpov's eyes. Zemo watches the water level rise.]
Vasily Karpov: Hail HYDRA.
[Holding the red book Zemo walks away. Karpov twitches and struggles in his bindings.]
[The Avengers are gathered at HQ. Steve is sitting, studying the Accords, while Rhodey and Sam argue behind him.]
James Rhodes: Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honor, which is one more than you have.
Sam Wilson: So let's say we agree to this thing. How long is it gonna be before they LoJack us like a bunch of common criminals?
James Rhodes: A 117 countries want to sign this. 117, Sam, and you're just like, "No, that's cool. We got it. "
Sam Wilson: How long are you going to play both sides?
Vision: I have an equation.
Sam Wilson: Oh, this will clear it up.
Vision: In the eight years since Mr. Stark announced himself as Iron Man, the number of known enhanced persons has grown exponentially. And during the same period, the number of potentially world-ending events has risen at a commensurate rate.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying it's our fault?
Vision: I'm saying there may be a causality. Our very strength invites challenge. Challenge incites conflict. And conflict . . . breeds catastrophe. Oversight . . . oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand.
James Rhodes: Boom.
[Tony is lying on the couch. When Natasha speaks, he looks at her.]
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. You are being uncharacteristically non-hyper-verbal.
Steve Rogers: It's because he's already made up his mind.
Tony Stark: Boy, you know me so well.
[He gets up and winces, rubbing the back of his head.]
Tony Stark: Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache.
[He walks to the kitchen and grabs a mug.]
Tony Stark: That's what's going on, Cap. It's just pain. It's discomfort. Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal? Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?
[He puts his phone in a basket and taps it.The phone projects an image of a smiling young man. He looks down, then back up, and pretends to notice the picture for the first time.]
Tony Stark: Oh, that's Charles Spencer, by the way. He's a great kid. Computer engineering degree, 3.6 GPA. Had a floor level gig at Intel planned for the fall. But first, he wanted to put a few miles on his soul, before he parked it behind a desk. See the world. Maybe be of service. Charlie didn't want to go to Vegas or Fort Lauderdale, which is what I would do. He didn't go to Paris or Amsterdam, which sounds fun. He decided to spend his summer building sustainable housing for the poor. Guess where, Sokovia.
[The others look affected by this .]
Tony Stark: He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass. [He takes a pill with some coffee, then faces the others.]
Tony Stark: There's no decision-making process here. We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys.
Steve Rogers: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
Tony Stark: Who said we're giving up?
Steve Rogers: We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. This document just shifts the blames.
James Rhodes: I'm sorry. Steve. That - that is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we're talking about. It's not the World Security Council, it's not SHIELD, it's not HYDRA.
Steve Rogers: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
Tony Stark: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
Steve Rogers: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
Tony Stark: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
Wanda Maximoff: You're saying they'll come for me.
Vision: We would protect you.
Natasha Romanoff: Maybe Tony's right.
[Tony looks at her, surprised.]
Natasha Romanoff: If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off -
Sam Wilson: Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?
Natasha Romanoff: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
Tony Stark: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, I want to take it back now.
Tony Stark: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
[Steve's phone buzzes, and he pulls it out to check it. A text message reads: 'She's gone. In her sleep.']
Steve Rogers: I have to go.
[Steve gets up sharply, drops the Accords on the coffee table, and goes downstairs. He stops at the bottom of the stairs, leans against the banister, and bows his head.]
[London.]
[A cathedral, packed with mourners. A choir is singing. Steve is one of six pallbearers carrying a coffin draped with the Union Jack. His eyes are red--he's been crying.]
[At the altar, a candle burns by a framed photograph of Peggy Carter in a military uniform. The label reads "Margaret 'Peggy' Carter". The priest addresses the mourners.]
Priest: And now, I would like to invite Sharon Carter to come up and say a few words.
[Agent 13, Steve's "neighbor" from DC, steps up to the podium.]
[Steve sits beside Sam in a pew at the front. Steve is looking down and doesn't see Sharon walk up. Sam is watching, and nudges Steve. He looks up to see Sharon, who glances at Steve and takes a breath.]
Sharon Carter: Margaret Carter was known to most as a founder of SHIELD . . . but I just knew her as Aunt Peggy.
[Steve realizes who exactly Sharon is, and takes a surprised breath.]
Sharon Carter: She had a photograph in her office. Aunt Peggy standing next to JFK. As a kid, that was pretty cool. But it was a lot to live up to. Which is why I never told anyone we were related.
[She looks directly at Steve.]
Sharon Carter: I asked her once how she managed to master diplomacy and espionage in a time when no one wanted to see a woman succeed at either. And she said, compromise where you can. But where you can't, don't. Even if everyone is telling you that something wrong is something right. Even if the whole world is telling you to move . . . it is your duty to plant yourself like a tree, look them in they eye and say " No, you move."
[Later, Steve stands alone in the isle, still dressed in black. Natasha to him and he turns to her. He begins to speak without any introduction]
Steve Rogers: When I came out of the ice, I thought everyone I had known was gone. Then I found out that she was alive. I was just lucky to have her.
Natasha Romanoff: She had you back, too.
Steve Rogers: Who else signed?
Natasha Romanoff: Tony. Rhodey. Vision.
Steve Rogers: Clint?
Natasha Romanoff: Says he's retired.
[She smiles slightly.]
Steve Rogers: Wanda?
Natasha Romanoff: TBD (To Be Determined). I'm off to Vienna for the signing of the Accords. There's plenty of room on the jet.
[Steve sighs and bows his head.]
Natasha Romanoff: Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together.
[Natasha almost seems to be convincing herself.]
Steve Rogers: What are we giving up to do it?
[She sighs. He shakes his head, unconvinced.]
Steve Rogers: I'm sorry, Nat. I can't sign it.
Natasha Romanoff: I know.
Steve Rogers: Then what are you doing here?
Natasha Romanoff: I didn't want you to be alone.
[She pulls him in for a hug.]
Natasha Romanoff: Come here.
[Vienna.]
[The United Nations, a modern complex of interestingly-shaped high rise buildings.]
News Anchor #3: At a special United Nations conference 117 countries have come together to ratify the Sokovia Accords.
[T'Challa wears a sharp suit and stands, looking through a glass wall.]
UN staffer: Excuse me, Miss Romanoff?
Natasha Romanoff: Yes?
UN staffer: These need your signature. [T'Challa looks over at Natasha.] Thank you.
Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.
T'Challa: I suppose neither of us is used to the spotlight.
Natasha Romanoff: Oh, well, it's not always so flattering.
T'Challa: You seem to be doing alright so far. Considering your last trip to Capitol Hill . . . I wouldn't think you would be particularly comfortable in this company.
Natasha Romanoff: Well, I'm not.
T'Challa: That alone makes me glad you're here, Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: Why? You don't approve of all this?
T'Challa: The Accords, yes. The politics, not really. Two people in a room can get more done than a hundred.
King T'Chaka: Unless you need to move a piano.
T'Challa: Father.
King T'Chaka: Son. Miss Romanoff.
Natasha Romanoff: King T'Chaka. Please, allow me to apologize for what happened in Nigeria.
King T'Chaka: Thank you. Thank you for agreeing to all this. I'm sad to hear that Captain Rogers will not be joining us today.
Natasha Romanoff: Yes, so am I.
Man on speakers: If everyone could please be seated. This assembly is now in session.
T'Challa: That is the future calling. Such a pleasure.
Natasha Romanoff: Thank you. [Natasha goes.]
King T'Chaka: For a man who disapproves of diplomacy, you're getting quite good at it.
T'Challa: I'm happy, Father.
King T'Chaka: Thank you.
T'Challa: Thank you.
King T'Chaka: When stolen Wakandan vibranium was used to make a terrible weapon, we in Wakanda were forced to question our legacy. Those men and women killed in Nigeria, were part of a goodwill mission from a country too long in the shadows. We will not, however, let misfortune drive us back. We will fight to improve the world we wish to join. I am grateful to the Avengers for supporting this initiative. [T'Challa spots something outside.] Wakanda is proud to extend its hand in peace.
T'Challa: EVERYBODY GET DOWN!
[An enormous explosion goes off between two buildings and destroys the conference hall. T'Challa finds his father lying on the floor with his eyes closed. He grabs his father's wrist and feels for a pulse, but his father lies still. Devastated T'Challa lies across his father. He lifts him up and rocks him in his arms.]
[A hotel.]
Sharon Carter: My mom tried to talk me out of enlisting, but, um, not Aunt Peggy. She bought me my first thigh holster.
Steve Rogers: Very practical.
Sharon Carter: And stylish. [Sharon and Steve wait by an elevator. They stand facing each other.]
Steve Rogers: CIA has you stationed over here now?
Sharon Carter: In Berlin, Joint Terrorism Task Force.
Steve Rogers: Right. Right. Sounds fun.
Sharon Carter: I know, right?
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods and smiles at Sharon.] I've been meaning to ask you. When you were spying on me from across the hall . . . .
Sharon Carter: You mean when I was doing my job.
Steve Rogers: Did Peggy know?
Sharon Carter: She kept so many secrets. I didn't want her to have one from you. [The elevator arrives.] Thanks for walking me back.
Steve Rogers: Sure. [Sam comes over.]
Sam Wilson: Steve. There's something you gotta see.
News anchor #4: A bomb hidden in a news van . . .
Sharon Carter: Who's coordinating?
News anchor #4: . . . ripped through the UN building in Vienna.
Sharon Carter: Good. They're solid. Forensics?
News anchor #4: More than 70 people have been injured. At least 12 are dead, including Wakanda's King T'Chaka. Officials have released a video of a suspect who they have identified as James Buchanan Barnes, the Winter Soldier. The infamous HYDRA agent, linked to numerous acts of terrorism and political assassinations.
Sharon Carter: I have to go to work.
[Fire crews hose down the buildings. A red and white medical chopper flies overhead.]
Sharon Carter: Call MI-6, see if we can get Micro Forensics to hurry this up. We need the whole team here in two hours or it's not worth it. [Sharon strides through with a man in a green jumpsuit. They pass T'Challa who sits on a bench looking stunned. There's a cut on his head. Natasha sits on the next bench along.]
Natasha Romanoff: I'm very sorry.
T'Challa: [He glances at her. He's holding an ornate silver ring which he toys with between his fingers.] In my culture death is not the end. It's more of a . . . stepping-off point. You reach out with both hands and Bast and Sekhmet, they lead you into the green veldt where . . . you can run forever.
Natasha Romanoff: That sounds very peaceful.
T'Challa: My father thought so. [He puts the ring on his finger.] I am not my father.
Natasha Romanoff: T'Challa. Task force will decide who brings in Barnes.
T'Challa: [He clenches his fist.] Don't bother, Miss Romanoff. I'll kill him myself. [He walks away.]
[Steve phones Natasha. He's standing on the street in a cap and dark glasses.]
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah?
Steve Rogers: You alright?
Natasha Romanoff: Ah, yeah, thanks. I got lucky. [Frowning she looks around, then stands up.] I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please.
Steve Rogers: Are you saying you'll arrest me?
Natasha Romanoff: No. Someone will. If you interfere. That's how it works now.
Steve Rogers: If he's this far gone, Nat, I should be the one to bring him in.
Natasha Romanoff: Why?
Steve Rogers: Because I'm the one least likely to die trying. [Not far away Steve ends the call.]
Natasha Romanoff: Shit.
[Steve approaches Sam sitting at the counter of a coffee shop.]
Sam Wilson: She tell you to stay out of it? [He's also in a cap and shades.] Might have a point.
Steve Rogers: He'd do it for me.
Sam Wilson: 1945, maybe. I just want to make sure we considered all our options. The people that shoot at you usually wind up shooting at me. [Sharon arrives by Steve.]
Sharon Carter: Tips have been pouring in since that footage went public. Everybody thinks the Winter soldier goes to their gym. Most of it's noise. Except for this. [She slides Steve a file.] My boss expects a briefing, pretty much now . . . so that's all the head start you're gonna get.
Steve Rogers: Thank you.
Sharon Carter: And you're gonna have to hurry. We have orders to shoot on sight.
[Zemo sits in a hotel room. He reads from Karpov's red book.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. Возвращение на Родину. Один. Один. Грузовой вагон… Грузовой вагон. Грузов- ([subtitled] Homecoming. One. One. Fright Car.) [Knocking at the door. He puts the book in a drawer and goes to the door. He reaches for a gun tucked in the back of his trouser and cocks it.]
German Innkeeper: Herr Müller, ich habe Ihr Frühstück. ([subtitled] Mr. Müller. I have your breakfast.) [Zemo opens the door.]
Helmut Zemo: Ich konnte es schon von weitem riechen. Danke. ([subtitled] I could smell it before I opened the door. Thank you.)
German Innkeeper: Speck und schwarzer Kaffe. Wieder. Ich kann Ihnen auch was anderes machen, wenn Sie das möchten. ([subtitled] Side of bacon and black coffee. Again. I can make you something different, if you like.)
Helmut Zemo: Bitte sehr, das ist wunderbar. ([subtitled] It's okay. This is wonderful.)
German Innkeeper: Ich stell es dann mal hier hin… ([subtitled] I'll put this on your . . .)
Helmut Zemo: Nein, nein. Das geht schon. Ich mach das. Vielen Dank, Frau Leiber. ([subtitled] No, no. It's okay. I can manage. Thank you Mrs. Leiber.) [Zemo closes the door. In the room is a large device with a cage at the bottom and a drum of coppered wire on top.]
[Bucharest. Bucky is in civvies at a fruit store. He buys some plums!]
Bucky Barnes: [talking to the vendor in Romanian] ([assumed translation] How are they? Are they good? Give me six, thank you.[2])
[In a black cap and casual jacket Bucky walks along scanning around. Across the street he spots a twenty-something vender at a news-stand watching him. Bucky glances away, then looks back at the vender who's still watching him. The vender runs from his kiosk. Bucky goes over and picks up a paper. On the front page there are surveillance-photos of a man and the head line: 'Winter Soldier cautat pentru Bombardmentul din Viena'. Bucky glances around tensely.]
[In his dark blue, armored suit with his shield on his arm Steve is in a small apartment. He looks around, there's a mattress with disheveled covers and various bits of cheap looking furniture. The kitchen and bedroom are in the same room. Steve finds a notebook on top of the fridge. He picks it up and opens it. There are tabs of varying colors sticking out from amongst the pages.]
Sam Wilson: [on radio] Heads up, Cap. German Special Forces, approaching from the south.
Steve Rogers: Understood. [Bucky's standing behind Steve. Steve slowly turns around to face him.] Do you know me?
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky stares at him.] You're Steve. I read about you in a museum.
Sam Wilson: They've set the perimeter.
Steve Rogers: I know you're nervous. And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying.
Bucky Barnes: I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore.
Sam Wilson: They're entering the building.
Steve Rogers: Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive.
Bucky Barnes: That's smart. Good strategy.
Sam Wilson: They're on the roof. I'm compromised.
[Armed cops run upstairs.]
Steve Rogers: This doesn't have end in a fight, Buck.
[Outside the door a cop readies a battering ram.]
Bucky Barnes: It always ends in a fight.
Sam Wilson: 5 seconds.
Steve Rogers: You pulled me from the river. Why?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Sam Wilson: 3 seconds!
Steve Rogers: Yes, you do.
Sam Wilson: Breach! Breach! Breach! [A grenade crashes through the window. Bucky kicks it to Steve, and he smothers it with his shield.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Schieß die Tür auf! (Shoot the door!) [The cop slams the battering ram against the door. Bucky shields himself with the mattress against an attack from the window. He blocks the door with a table as cops swing in on cables. Steve pulls the rug from under a policeman, sending him flying. Bucky slams another policeman into the wall.]
Steve Rogers: Buck, stop! You're gonna kill someone.
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky slams Steve down and punches a hole in the floor.] I'm not gonna kill anyone.
[Bucky grabs a backpack from under the floorboards and throws it out of the window. Bucky and Steve get behind Steve's shield to avoid gunfire. Bucky shoves Steve and he knocks a cop over. Bucky holds up his metal hand and repells bullets, then slams a cop into shelves. Bucky picks up a large cement brick and slams it into a cop. Steve fights a cop on the balcony. A cop shoots around the door outside. Bucky punches through the wall beside he door. He lays into the cops. A cop descends through a sky-light on a zip wire. Bucky grabs the cop's gun and slams him into the wall. Bucky bashes a couple of cops with the battering ram. More of the police team hurry up the stairwell. Bucky jumps on the zip-line-guy and swings down a level.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Der Verdächtige ist ausgebrochen. Er ist am östlichen Treppenschacht. ([subtitled] Suspect has broken containment! He's headed down the east stairwell!)
[Steve grabs the radio and crushes it. Steve jumps down a level as Bucky keeps punching the cops. Bucky tosses one of them over the railing and Steve catches him, stopping the cop from falling. He looks at Bucky wearily.]
Steve Rogers: Come on, man.
[Steve throws the cop up onto the landing. Bucky breaks a banister and swings down on it. Steve hurls a cop over his shoulders. Bucky lays into jet more cops and takes them out. A cop aims at Bucky and Steve knocks the gun from his hands with his shield which sticks in the wall. Bucky leaps down the stairwell and catches onto a railing. Steve pulls his shiel out of the wall. Bucky climbs up then runs along a corridor and leaps off a balcony. He tumbles onto the lower roof of the neighboring building where he finds where his backpack. he picks it up and runs.]
[A muscular man clad entirely in black, Black Panther, slams into Bucky from behind, knocking him down. He has a full face mask with pointed ears. He extends his fingers and sharp claws pop out. He attacks Bucky with sweeping kicks and slashes. Bucky fights back but is kicked into a wall. Black Panther swipes his claws and spins gracefully. Bucky narrowly avoids being slashed, he holds up a metal bar to protect himself.]
[Steve looks down at them as Falcon swoops from the sky.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, southwest rooftop.
Sam Wilson: Who the hell's the other guy?
Steve Rogers: About to find out.
[Steve leaps from the balcony down onto the neighboring building as a chopper flies up. Black Panther lunges at Bucky with his claws, but Bucky grabs his wrists. A soldier fires a machine gun from the chopper. The ammo bounces off Black Panther's armored suit.]
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: Got him. [Sam flies down and shoves the chopper off course. Then swoops towards street level.]
[Bucky breaks free from his attacker, slings his bag on his back, runs and jumps down a level. Black Panther slides down the wall using his claws for traction. Back lands at street level and the chase continues. Steve follows and lands rolling along the ground. Gunfire from the chopper tears up the sidewalk. Bucky jumps down through an opening and lands in an underpass, he runs through the traffic. Black Panther and Captain America drop down and chase after Bucky. A Special Forces Vehicle pursues them.]
GSG-9 Driver: Stand down! Stand down! [The vehicle closes in, blue lights flashing. Steve leaps onto the vehicle and splinters the windshield. The driver stops, Steve yanks him from the vehicle and kicks the windshield out, then drives off.]
[Bucky runs over the top of a speeding car, outpacing it. Black Panther is a few cars behind, keeping pace with Bucky. he leaps on the back of the 4x4 that Steve's driving. Steve swerves from side to side, trying to throw him off.]
Steve Rogers: Sam, I can't shake this guy.
Sam Wilson: Right behind you.
[Several police cars join the chase. Steve side-swipes another car and drives on.]
[Up ahead Bucky reaches a fork in the road and faces oncoming traffic. He leaps over a barrier. Steve drives through the barrier.]
[A motorbike speeds towards Bucky. Bucky grabs the handlebar and spins the bike around in mid air, throwing the rider off. Bcuky gets on the bike and rides away sending cars careering out of the way. Steve keeps on Bucky's tail with Black Panther holding onto the back of the 4x4. They all rocket through another underpass. Sam flies into the underpass. Black Panther leaps off the front of the 4x4 onto Bucky's motorbike. Bucky flings him over his head and the bike leans down on its side. Bucky kicks his assailant away, straightens up and rides on. Black Panther catches a ride on Falcon's leg. Sam tries to kick Black Panther away. Bucky throws a sticky bomb and blows up the roof at the end of the underpass, bringing down tons of rubble. Black Panther leaps off from Falcon and throws Bucky off the motorbike. Steve swerves the 4x4 through the rubble, leaps out and pulls Black Panther away from Bucky. Steve stands, facing sleek and muscular Black Panther. Armed police arrive and surround them, guns aimed. War Machine leaps down from above and raises both hands.]
James Rhodes: Stand down, now. [Bucky stands beside Steve who puts his shield on his back.] Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal. [Police move in and force Bucky to his knees. Black Panther raises his hands. A cop moves Steve's arms behind his back. Black Panther retracts his claws and pulls off his mask revealing his face. It's T'Challa. Steve and Rhodes look curious.]
GSG-9 Soldier: Wie lautet der Befehl? (What's the order?)
James Rhodes: Your highness. [Bucky's hauled flat on the ground.]
[Avengers HQ. Vision follows a recipe.]
Vision: 'A pinch of paprika.' A pinch. [He adds a pinch. Wanda strolls in.]
Wanda Maximoff: Is that paprikash?
Vision: I thought it might . . . lift your spirits.
Wanda Maximoff: [She chuckles, stirs the ingredients in the pan with a spoon. She lifts the spoon to her lips, blows and has a taste. She smiles.] Spirits lifted.
Vision: In my defense, I haven't actually ever . . . eaten anything before, so . . .
Wanda Maximoff: May I?
Vision: Please. Wanda?
Wanda Maximoff: Hmm.
Vision: No one dislikes you, Wanda. [She frowns curiously.]
Wanda Maximoff: Thanks.
Vision: Oh, you're welcome. No, it's a . . . involuntary response in their amygdala. They can't help but be afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you?
Vision: My amygdala is synthetic, so . . . [Wanda laughs.]
Wanda Maximoff: I used to think of myself one way. But after this . . . [her fingers glow.] I am something else. I'm still me, I think, but . . . that's not what everyone else sees.
Vision: [He touches the mind stone in his forehead.] Do you know, I don't know what this is? [It glows.] Not really. I know it's not of this world, that it powered Loki's staff, gave you your abilities, but . . . its true nature is a mystery. And yet, it is part of me.
Wanda Maximoff: Are you afraid of it?
Vision: I wish to understand it. The more I do, the less it controls me. One day . . . who knows? I may even control it.
Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda looks at the food.] I don't know what's in this but it is not paprika. I'm gonna go to the store. I'll be back in 20 minutes.
Vision: Alternatively, we could order a pizza?
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, are you not letting me leave?
Vision: [He blocks her way.] It is a question of safety.
Wanda Maximoff: I can protect myself.
Vision: [He holds her arm.] Not yours. Mr. Stark would like to avoid the possibility of another public incident. Until the Accords are on a . . . more secured foundation.
Wanda Maximoff: And what do you want?
Vision: For people to see you . . . as I do. [She looks at him gravely.]
[Berlin, day. Traffic rolls around the victory column. Police convoy drives beside the river Spree. Amidst the convoy is a gray armed truck. Inside Bucky wears restraints inside a prison pod. Three armed guards sit on the other side of the glass-walled pod. A police motorbike stops traffic and a van driver looks affronted. The convoy turns a corner onto a bridge across the river. In an SUV T'Challa sits in front of Steve who sits in front of Sam.]
Sam Wilson: So, you like cats?
Steve Rogers: Sam.
Sam Wilson: What? Dude shows up dressed like a cat and you don't wanna know more?
Steve Rogers: Your suit . . . t's Vibranium?
T'Challa: [T'Challes eyes narrow as he glances sideways.] The Black Panther has been the protector of Wakanda for generations. A mantle, passed from warrior to warrior. And now, because your friend murdered my father, I also wear the mantle of king. So, I ask you . . . as both warrior and king . . . how long do you think you can keep your friend safe from me? [Steve is stony faced as the convoy heads underground.]
[In a light gray walled bunker Bucky's pod is carried away by a forklift. Nearby Steve gets out of the SUV and glances across at Bucky who doesn't spot him. With Sam and T'Challa Steve approaches Sharon who's standing with a diminutive, gray-head man.]
Steve Rogers: What's gonna happen to him?
Everett Ross: Same thing that ought to happen to you. Psychological evaluation and extradition.
Sharon Carter: This is Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander.
Steve Rogers: What about our lawyer?
Everett Ross: Lawyer. That's funny. See their weapons are placed in lockup. Oh, we'll write you a receipt.
Sam Wilson: I better not look out the window and see anybody flying around in that. [As they go Steve looks back and catches Bucky's eye.]
[On a covered sky walk.]
Everett Ross: You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favor, stay in it?
T'Challa: I don't intend on going anywhere.
Natasha Romanoff: For the record, this is what making things worse looks like.
Steve Rogers: He's alive.
Tony Stark: [on his phone] No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
Natasha Romanoff: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
Tony Stark: [still on the phone.] Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
Steve Rogers: 'Consequences'?
Tony Stark: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
Steve Rogers: I'm not getting that shield back, am I?
Natasha Romanoff: Technically, it's the government's property. Wings, too.
Sam Wilson: That's cold.
Tony Stark: Warmer than jail.
[At a power station surrounded by trees the van with the driver who was affronted by the police convoy pulls up by the open gate. Scowling he puts the parking break on and picks up a clip board.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Das kann nicht richtig sein. Was zum Teufel? (This can't be right. What the hell?)
[In a secured chamber a guard connects a pipe to Bucky's prison pod. The lights inside dim for a moment.]
[Tony finds Steve in a glass-walled office overlooking the control room.]
Tony Stark: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. [Tony shows him two pens in a black presentation box.] FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
Steve Rogers: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
Tony Stark: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
Steve Rogers: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
Tony Stark: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
Steve Rogers: Pregnant?
Tony Stark: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
Steve Rogers: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
Tony Stark: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. [Tony stands up and paces.] In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
Steve Rogers: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
Tony Stark: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
Steve Rogers: I don't mean to make things difficult.
Tony Stark: I know, because you're a very polite person.
Steve Rogers: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
Tony Stark: No, you don't.
Steve Rogers: [Steve smiles thinly.] No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
Tony Stark: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns thoughtfully and picks up one of the fountain pens. He stands up and paces, then turns to Tony. In the control room beyond there are multiple screens on the walls.] I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
Tony Stark: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
Steve Rogers: Wanda? What about Wanda?
Tony Stark: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
Steve Rogers: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
Tony Stark: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
Steve Rogers: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
Tony Stark: She's not a US citizen.
Steve Rogers: Oh, come on, Tony.
Tony Stark: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
Steve Rogers: She's a kid!
Tony Stark: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
Steve Rogers: [Steve nods faintly.] You keep telling yourself that. [He puts the pen down.] Hate to break up the set. [He leaves the office and rueful Tony watches Bucky on one of the control room's screens.]
Helmut Zemo: [The evaluator sits at a desk facing Bucky's pod. Inside Bucky's still restrained.] Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?
Sharon Carter: [In an office with Sam and Steve.] The receipt for your gear.
Sam Wilson: 'Bird costume'? Come on.
Sharon Carter: I didn't write it. [Sharon pushes a button witch stops the restriction on the audio from Bucky's evaluation.]
Helmut Zemo: I'm not here to judge you. I just want to ask you a few questions. Do you know where you are, James? I can't help you if you don't talk to me, James.
Bucky Barnes: My name is Bucky.
[At the power station. The van driver honks and looks impatient watching the custodian's hut's front door.]
Delivery Truck Driver: Hallo? ([subtitled] Hello?) [The custodian comes outside and the driver comes out of his van.] Hey. Ich hab eine große für dich. ([subtitled] Hey. I have a big one for you.) [He opens the van's back doors and removes a large wooden crate.] Ja. Okay, hier unterzeichnen. (Okay. Here. Just sign here.)
Custodian: Hier? (Here?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ja. (Yeah.) [The custodian signs for the crate.]
[At the UN-bunker Steve studies the blurry photograph of the man who bombed the congress in Vienna.]
Steve Rogers: Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?
Sharon Carter: Get the word out, involve as many eyes as we can?
Steve Rogers: Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.
Sharon Carter: You're saying someone framed him to find him.
Sam Wilson: Steve, we looked for the guy for two years and found nothing.
Steve Rogers: We didn't bomb the UN. That turns a lot of heads.
Sharon Carter: Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would. [Sharon's gaze falls on the evaluator in the screen, her eyes narrow.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve frowns and looks around.] Yeah.
Helmut Zemo: [In the secure chamber.] Tell me, Bucky. You've seen a great deal, haven't you?
Bucky Barnes: I don't want to talk about it.
Helmut Zemo: You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry. [Zemo gets a message on his screen: 'message inbox:1' touches it 'status: package delivered'.] We only have to talk about one.
[At the power station the custodian opens the crate. Finding Zemo's large device inside, he looks confused. The driver is at the back door of his van.]
Custodian: Hey, was ist das? (Hey. What is this?)
Delivery Truck Driver: Ich weiß es nicht. (I don't know.)
[The device erupts. A bubble of energy engulfs the power station and sparks fly. In the city traffic lights fail. In the bunker the lights go out.]
Everett Ross: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
Tony Stark: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
Sharon Carter: [In the office.] Sub-level 5, east wing. [T'Challa spots Steve and Sam bolting.]
[In Bucky's pod.]
Bucky Barnes: What the hell is this?
Helmut Zemo: Why don't we discuss your home? Not Romania. Certainly not Brooklyn, no. I mean, your real home. [Zemo removes his glasses then walks towards Bucky reading from the red book by torchlight.] Желание. ([subtitled] Longing.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky shuts his eyes.] No. [Bucky's head snaps back.]
Helmut Zemo: Ржавый. ([subtitled] Rusted.)
Bucky Barnes: Stop.
Helmut Zemo: Семнадцать. ([subtitled] Seventeen.)
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky's metal arm trembles in its restraint.] Stop. [He sneers angrily.]
Helmut Zemo: Рассвет. ([subtitled] Daybreak.)
[Bucky screams, clenches his fist and rips free of his restraints.]
Helmut Zemo: Печь. ([subtitled] Furnace.) Девять. ([subtitled] Nine.)
[Bucky thumps the inside of the pod.]
Helmut Zemo: Добросердечный. ([subtitled] Benign.)
[Bucky punches harder.]
Helmut Zemo: Возвращение на Родину. ([subtitled] Homecoming.) Один. ([subtitled:] One.) Грузовой вагон. ([subtitled] Freight car.)
[Bucky batteres the front of the pod with his metal fist and the glass screen flies clear. Zemo slowly rounds the pod with the book and the torch in hand. he stands before Bucky who straightens, a dark frown on his face.]
Helmut Zemo: Солдат? ([subtitled] Soldier?)
Bucky Barnes: Я готов отвечать. ([subtitled] Ready to comply.)
Helmut Zemo: Mission report. December 16, 1991.
[Steve and Sam arrive outside the chamber. Red emergency lights flash all around. There are many agents slumped on the floor. All of them out cold.]
Helmut Zemo: Help me. Help.
Steve Rogers: [Steve finds Zemo in a heap inside the chamber.] Get up. [he grabs Zemo and shoves him against the wall.] Who are you? What do you want?
Helmut Zemo: To see an empire fall.
[As Sam enters Bucky swings his fist which smashes through the wall as Sam ducks. Bucky grabs him by the jaw and throws him at the open pod. Steve lurches into the fight and lands a punch which Bucky barely feels. Bucky kicks and punches Steve out of the chamber. A punch from Bucky goes through the elevator door. Steve blocks the next one but the power of Bucky's fist sends Steve tumbling into the darkened elevator shaft.]
[In the chamber Sam comes around and spots Zemo looking down the elevator shaft.]
Man on PA #1: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. Ich wiederhole: Der Ostflügel ist kompromittiert. (The east wing is compromised. I repeat: the east wing is compromised.)
Sam Wilson: Hey.
[Zemo bolts, Sam rises. At the bottom of the shaft Steve pushes himself off the floor.]
[In the control room.]
Everett Ross: Evac all civilians. Get me a perimeter around the building, and gunships in the air.
Natasha Romanoff: Please tell me you brought a suit.
Tony Stark: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
Sharon Carter: Follow me. [Sharon runs past Tony and Natasha.]
[Sam chases Zemo up a stair well.]
[Steve starts to climb the elevator shaft.]
[Bucky stalks through the building's ground floor. He batters two guards. With tech-glasses on Tony takes cover behind a pillar.]
Natasha Romanoff: [on radio:] We're in position.
[Tony taps a wrist-control which becomes his Iron Man-glove. He zaps Bucky with a stun-burst before Bucky can shoot a guard. Tony rushes him, firing again. Bucky ducks the blast then trades blows with Tony, firing the gun. Tony has the Iron Man-glove over the barrel, blocking the bullet. He pulls the gun barrel loose then Bucky smacks him backwards. Sharon rushes Bucky, then Natasha rushes Bucky. They both land kicks and punches, then Bucky flips Sharon head over heels. She smashes onto a table then Natasha leaps on Bucky, legs around his neck. He slams her onto another table and grabs her throat.]
Natasha Romanoff: You could at least recognize me.
[T'Challa comes from nowhere and kicks Bucky off Natasha. He fights with Bucky, landing lightning fast kicks and some punches. Bucky gets a counter punch in and T'Challa falls, but quickly recovers. Bucky hurries up some stairs. T'Challa leaps the levels and vaults a railing, landing in front of Bucky. Limber T'Challa spin-kicks and grabs Bucky's metal arm which he tries to twist then looks worried as he realizes it isn't going to work. He throws Bucky backwards and keeps hold as they both tumble down the stairs. They resume fighting on the small landing and a leg sweep sends Bucky over the railing. T'Challa leaps down after him but finds the wide reception empty. He scans around.]
[Outside staff flee the building en masse. Sam is among them and quickly spots something on the ground. He picks it up.]
Sam Wilson: Damn it. [he looks around the wide courtyard and scowls.]
[Bucky's on the rooftop helipad. He marches up to a blue chopper and pulls the lock off the door. he gets in the pilot seat. Steve rushes outside and sprints toward the rising chopper. He leaps and grabs the landing gear. Muscles bulging Steve pulls hard and the chopper struggles to gain height. Steve's feet kick for traction then he gets them flat on the helipad. The chopper drags him onto the weak looking mesh framing the helipad. Steve grabs the railing with one hand and clings to the landing gear with the other. He grits his teeth and his neck strains with the incredible effort. Bucky glowers from inside the chopper then throws the joystick left and the chopper's nose slams into the edge of the helipad. The rotor-blades are smashed to pieces and Steve ducks as the tail swings around. The chopper lies twisted on the mesh at the edge of the pad. Steve rises beside the canopy. Bucky's arm smashes through the glass and growling he grabs Steve's throat. The chopper starts to list over the edge. The tail breaks off and falls into the river below. Bucky keeps hold of Steve as the whole vehicle drops and slams into the river. The impact seems to knock Bucky out cold and he lets go of Steve. The body of the chopper sinks quickly to the riverbed along with other debris. Steve surfaces with Bucky in his arms.]
[At an airport Zemo listens to a phone message.:]
Zemo's Wife: He asked me again if you were going to be there. I said I wasn't sure. You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
[Frowning Zemo ends the call. A TV news report is playing nearby:]
News anchor #5: James Barnes, der mit dem Bombenanschlag auf die UN in Wien in Verbindung gebracht wird, ist heute aus der Haft entflohen. Ebenfalls vermisst werden die Avengers Captain Steve Rogers und Sam Wilson. ([subtitled:] James Barnes, the suspect in the UN Vienna bombing escaped custody today. Also missing Avenger Captain Steve Rogers and Sam Wilson.)
[Zemo eyes the TV screen. He stands in line at a departures gate. The screen above the gate reads: 'Gate 06 | Berlin Flughafen | AEM2103 | 14:10 | Moskau/Moscow']
[In a huge abandoned warehouse Bucky comes to with his metallic left arm clamped in a huge industrial vice. Steve peers through a gap at a chopper flying overhead. Sam's over by Bucky.]
Sam Wilson: Hey, Cap! [Steve goes over to join Sam by Bucky who sits with his arm in the vice. They stare at him.]
Bucky Barnes: Steve.
Steve Rogers: Which Bucky am I talking to?
Bucky Barnes: Your mom's name was Sarah...You used to wear newspapers in your shoes.
Steve Rogers: Can't read that in a museum.
Sam Wilson: Just like that, we're suppose to be cool?
Bucky Barnes: What did I do?
Steve Rogers: Enough.
Bucky Barnes: Oh, God, I knew this would happen. Everything HYDRA put inside me is still there. All he had to do was say the goddamn words.
Steve Rogers: Who was he?
Bucky Barnes: I don't know.
Steve Rogers: People are dead. The bombing, the setup. The doctor did all that just to get 10 minutes with you. I need you to do better than "I don't know."
Bucky Barnes: He wanted to know about Siberia. Where I was kept. He wanted to know exactly where.
Steve Rogers: Why would he need to know that?
Bucky Barnes: Because I'm not the only Winter Soldier.
[1991, at night Bucky rides alongside the car and somehow causes the car to crash. He circles back, pulls up and climbs off the motorbike. he's filmed on CCTV as he approaches the car's trunk. He janks it open, breaking the lock. Inside he opens a metal case which contains five clear drip bags filled with bright blue fluid.]
[Four young men and a young woman sit up in hospital beds. The blue fluid is fed intravenously into their arms. The drip bags hang on stands beside them. They're all fit and muscular. One man, Josef, flexes a huge biceps. Josef is screaming, dragged into a cell and left on a bed.]
Josef / Super Soldier #1: It hurts! [He struggles in leather bindings. A viewing slot is closed.]
[Karpov is sitting at a desk in a corridor, making notes and listening. Karpov opens the door to a lab and switches on the light. Josef is sitting on a bed. He looks up at Karpov.]
[Bucky and Josef fight each other in a barred chamber. The four others who were given the blue liquid are there. Josef kicks with enormous power, sending Bucky flying. Watching Karpov folds his arms.
Vasily Karpov: Очень хорошо, Иосиф. ([subtitled] Good work.)
[A medic takes Josef's pulse and Josef slams him onto the floor. A soldier clubs Josef onto the back with no effect. Karpov gets behind Bucky and aims a gun.]
Vasily Karpov: Солдат, вытащи меня отсюда! ([subtitled] Get me out of here.)
[Josef and the other four Winter Soldiers effortlessly dispatch a squad of Soldiers. Bucky escorts covering Karpov from the barred chamber, batting guards aside.]
Steve Rogers: Who were they?
Bucky Barnes: Their most elite death squad. More kills than anyone in HYDRA history. And that was before the serum.
Sam Wilson: They all turn out like you?
Bucky Barnes: Worse.
Steve Rogers: The doctor, could he control them?
Bucky Barnes: Enough.
Steve Rogers: Said he wanted to see an empire fall.
Bucky Barnes: With these guys he could do it. They speak 30 languages, can hide in plain sight, infiltrate, assassinate, destabilize, They can take a whole country down in one night. You'd never see them coming.
Sam Wilson: [Sam steps up to Steve.] This would have been a lot easier a week ago.
Steve Rogers: If we call Tony . . .
Sam Wilson: No, he won't believe us.
Steve Rogers: Even if he did . . .
Sam Wilson: Who knows if the Accords would let him help.
Steve Rogers: We're on our own.
Sam Wilson: Maybe not. I know a guy.
Secretary Ross: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
Tony Stark: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
Secretary Ross: You don't get it, Stark. It's not yours to handle. It's clear you can't be objective. I'm putting Special Ops on this.
Natasha Romanoff: What happens when the shooting starts? What, do you kill Steve Rogers?
Secretary Ross: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
Tony Stark: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
Secretary Ross: How would that end any differently from the last time?
Tony Stark: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
Secretary Ross: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
Tony Stark: Thank you, sir. [Tony slumps, exhaling.] My left arm is numb, is that normal?
Natasha Romanoff: [She pats him on the shoulder.] You alright?
Tony Stark: Always. [He has a massive black eye and a cut on his brow.] 36 hours, jeez.
Natasha Romanoff: We're seriously understaffed.
Tony Stark: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
Natasha Romanoff: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
Tony Stark: No.
Natasha Romanoff: I have an idea.
Tony Stark: Me too. Where's yours?
Natasha Romanoff: Downstairs. Where's yours? [Tony smiles slightly.]
[Queens, New York. Peter Parker walks out of an elevator holding a DVD-player and with a backpack on his shoulder. He walks into an apartment where his Aunt May is sitting on the couch with Tony Stark.]
Peter Parker: Hey, May.
May Parker: Mmm. Hey. How was school today?
Peter Parker: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . [Peter sees Tony and his eyes widen.]
Tony Stark: Oh, Mr. Parker.
Peter Parker: Um . . . [He takes out his earphones.] What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
Tony Stark: Tony.
Peter Parker: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
Tony Stark: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah.
Tony Stark: Right?
Peter Parker: Regarding the . . .
May Parker: You didn't tell me about the grant.
Peter Parker: About the grant.
Tony Stark: The September Foundation.
Peter Parker: Right.
Tony Stark: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
Peter Parker: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I approved, so now we're in business.
May Parker: You didn't tell me anything. What's up with that? You keeping secrets from me now?
Peter Parker: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
Tony Stark: That's what I'm here to hash out.
Peter Parker: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
Tony Stark: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
May Parker: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
Tony Stark: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
Peter Parker: Let me just stop you there.
Tony Stark: Yeah?
Peter Parker: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: Yeah?
Tony Stark: It's pretty well funded.
Peter Parker: Wow.
Tony Stark: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
May Parker: Sure.
Tony Stark: [In Peter's bedroom Tony bolts the door and spits out the walnut loaf.] As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. [He notices Peter's collection of old computers.] Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
Peter Parker: Uh, the garbage, actually.
Tony Stark: You're a dumpster diver.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
Tony Stark: Ah-ah! Me first.
Peter Parker: Okay.
Tony Stark: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. [He pulls out his phone which projects a video of Peter Parker in his Spider-Man outfit.] That's you, right?
Peter Parker: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
Tony Stark: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
Peter Parker: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: It's like that video. What is it?
Tony Stark: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
Peter Parker: Exactly.
Tony Stark: Oh, what have we here?
Peter Parker: [Peter hides his Spider-Man suit.] Uh . . . that's a . . .
Tony Stark: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
Peter Parker: [Peter folds his arms petulantly.] S . . . Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Not in that onesie, you're not.
Peter Parker: It's not a onesie. [Tony picks up the suit.] I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
Tony Stark: Who else knows? Anybody?
Peter Parker: Nobody.
Tony Stark: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
Peter Parker: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
Tony Stark: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
Peter Parker: I did.
Tony Stark: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
Peter Parker: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
Tony Stark: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
Peter Parker: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just that… when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
Tony Stark: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. [Peter sits on his bed and looks at Tony.] Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
Peter Parker: Because . . . [he fiddles with his fingers] because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
Tony Stark: Mm-Hmm.
Peter Parker: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
Tony Stark: Sure, because you're different.
Peter Parker: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . [Tony leans closer.] and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
Tony Stark: [he looks affected by Peter's words.] So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
Peter Parker: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
Tony Stark: [He slowly steps over to Peter whose leg is stretched out on the bed. Tony looks down at it.] I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. [Peter moves along. Tony sits beside him and raises his hand. He hesitantly clasps Peter's shoulder.] You got a passport?
Peter Parker: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
Tony Stark: You ever been to Germany?
Peter Parker: No.
Tony Stark: Oh, you'll love it.
Peter Parker: I can't go to Germany!
Tony Stark: Why?
Peter Parker: I got . . . homework.
Tony Stark: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
Peter Parker: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
Tony Stark: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
Peter Parker: [He webs Tony's hand to the door.] Don't tell Aunt May.
Tony Stark: Alright, Spider-Man. [They share an earnest look before Tony returns to his usual attitude.] Get me out of this.
Peter Parker: Sorry, I'll get the . . .
[Night, at Avengers' HQ. Vision floats above the floor. An explosion in the distance lights up the room for a moment. Vision and Wanda look out of the window.]
Wanda Maximoff: What is it?
Vision: Stay here, please.
[Vision goes. Suddenly Wanda compels a knife across the room. It stops dead in front of Clint's head.]
Clint Barton: Guess I shoulda knocked.
Wanda Maximoff: Oh my god! What are you doing here?
Clint Barton: Disappointing my kids. [He shoots arrows to both sides of the room.] I'm supposed to go water-skiing. Cap needs our help. Come on.
Vision: Clint! [Wanda and Clint stop.] You should not be here.
Clint Barton: [He turns around.] Really? I retire for, what, like five minutes, and it all goes to shit.
Vision: Please consider the consequences of your actions.
Clint Barton: Okay, they're considered. Okay, we gotta go. [Vision is held in a force field, crackling and sparkling between the two arrows.] It's this way.
Wanda Maximoff: I've caused enough problems.
Clint Barton: [Frowning Clint runs back from the door.] You gotta help me, Wanda. Look, you wanna mope, can go to high school. You wanna make amends, you get off your ass. Shit. [Vision breaks the force field with his mind stone. He punches Clint to the floor, Clint recovers quickly.] I knew I should've stretched. [He extends a baton and tries to hit Vision, but the blows go through him. Clint resorts to punches, then tries the baton again. It breaks. Clint tries to kick Vision, but his leg goes right through him. Vision gets Clint in a headlock.]
Vision: Clint, you can't overpower me.
Clint Barton: I know I can't. But she can.
Wanda Maximoff: Vision, that's enough. Let him go. I'm leaving.
Vision: I can't let you.
Wanda Maximoff: [She holds her hands apart, glowing with energy. Clint slips from Vision's grasp.] I'm sorry.
Vision: [He falters.] If you do this . . . they will never stop being afraid of you.
Wanda Maximoff: I can't control their fear, only my own. [She moves closer. Vision glows from within and crashes through the floor, and several floors beneath. Wanda and Clint stand over the holes in the floors.]
Clint Barton: Oh . . . come on. We got one more stop.
[Back at the Joint Counter Terrorist Centre:]
Attache: It's just a matter of time. Our satellites are running facial, bio-metric, and behavioral pattern scans.
Security Chief: [to Natasha who's standing in their way] Move, or you will be moved.
T'Challa: As entertaining as that would be . . .
Natasha Romanoff: You really think you can find him?
T'Challa: My resources are considerable.
Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, it took the world 70 years to find Barnes . . . so you could probably do that in about half the time.
T'Challa: You know where they are.
Natasha Romanoff: I know someone who does.
[Under an overpass:]
Sharon Carter: Not sure you understand the concept of a getaway car.
Steve Rogers: It's low profile.
Sharon Carter: Good, because this stuff tends to draw a crowd. [She opens the trunk of her car, revealing Steve's and Sams's gear.]
Bucky Barnes: [He sits behind Sam in the getaway car.] Can you move your seat up?
Sam Wilson: No.
Steve Rogers: I owe you again.
Sharon Carter: Keeping a list. [She glances at Bucky.] You know, he kinda tried to kill me.
Steve Rogers: Sorry. I'll put it on the list, too. They're going to come looking for you.
Sharon Carter: I know.
[They kiss.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you, Sharon.
Sharon Carter: That was . . .
Steve Rogers: Late.
Sharon Carter: Damn right. I should go.
Steve Rogers: Okay.
[On the 6th level of a parking garage at the Leipzig/Halle airport. Steve drives into the parking lot in the battered, old car. He parks by a grey van and gets out.]
Clint Barton: Cap.
Steve Rogers: You know I wouldn't have called If I had any other choice.
Clint Barton: Hey man, you're doing me a favor. Besides, I owe a debt.
Steve Rogers: Thanks for having my back.
Wanda Maximoff: It was time to get off my ass.
Steve Rogers: How about our other recruit?
Clint Barton: He's rarin' to go. Had to put a little coffee in him, but… he should be good.
Scott Lang: What timezone is this?
Clint Barton: Come on. Come on.
Scott Lang: [Scott shakes Steve's hand with an amazed look.] Captain America.
Steve Rogers: Mr. Lang.
Scott Lang: It's an honor. I'm shaking your hand too long. Wow! This is awesome! Captain America. [He looks at Wanda.] I know you, too. You're great! [He turns back and feels Steve's shoulders.] Jeez. Ah, look, I wanna say, I know you know a lot of super people, so . . . thinks for thanking of me. [(sic!) To Sam.] Hey, man!
Sam Wilson: What's up, Tic Tac?
Scott Lang: Uh, good to see you. Look, what happened last time when I . . .
Sam Wilson: It was a great audition, but it'll . . . it'll never happen again.
Steve Rogers: They tell you what we're up against?
Scott Lang: Something about some . . . psycho-assassins?
Steve Rogers: We're outside the law on this one. So, if you come with us, you're a wanted man.
Scott Lang: Yeah, well, what else is new?
Bucky Barnes: We should get moving.
Clint Barton: We got a chopper lined up.
Man on PA #2: Dies ist eine Notsituation. Alle Passagiere müssen den Flughafen sofort evakuieren. (This is an emergency. All passengers must evacuate the airport immediately.)
Bucky Barnes: They're evacuating the airport.
Sam Wilson: Stark.
Scott Lang: Stark?
Steve Rogers: Suit up.
[Steve in his uniform strides through an underpass, then jogs onto a private runway, heading for a grounded chopper. An electro-disabler slams onto the chopper and Steve looks up. Iron Man and War Machine decent.]
Tony Stark: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
James Rhodes: Definitely weird.
Steve Rogers: Hear me out, Tony. That doctor, the psychiatrist, he's behind all of this.
T'Challa: [T'Challa leaps over a truck.] Captain.
Steve Rogers: Your highness.
Tony Stark: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
Steve Rogers: You're after the wrong guy.
Tony Stark: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
Steve Rogers: And there are five more super soldiers just like him. I can't let the doctor find them first, Tony. I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
Tony Stark: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos! [Peter shoots a web, stealing Steve's shield and binding his hands.] Nice job, kid.
Peter Parker: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suit… Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
Peter Parker: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
Tony Stark: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
Peter Parker: Hey, everyone.
Tony Stark: . . . Good job.
Steve Rogers: You've been busy.
Tony Stark: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
Steve Rogers: You did that when you signed.
Tony Stark: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. [Steve looks aside.] Come on.
Sam Wilson: [He radios Steve.] We found it. Their Quinjet's in hanger five, north runway.
Steve Rogers: [Steve holds his hands up and Clint shoots the web off.] Alright, Lang.
Peter Parker: Hey, guys, something . . .
James Rhodes: Whoa. What--what the hell was that?
Scott Lang: [He retrieves Steve's shield.] I believe this is yours, Captain America.
Tony Stark: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
James Rhodes: Got two in the terminal, Wilson and Barnes.
T'Challa: Barnes is mine!
Peter Parker: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
Tony Stark: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
Peter Parker: Okay, copy that!
T'Challa: Move, Captain. I won't ask a second time.
Scott Lang: [He faces Natasha.] Look, I really don't want to hurt you.
Natasha Romanoff: I wouldn't stress about it. [She kicks him in the groin and he miniaturizes, throwing her head over heels. She zaps him off her wrist and he slams into a nearby truck, laving a small dent.]
Bucky Barnes: [In the terminal.] What the hell is that?
Sam Wilson: Everyone's got a gimmick now.
Peter Parker: [Peter swings through the glass wall and kicks Sam backwards. Bucky throws a punch, Peter catches his fist.] You have a metal arm? That is awesome, dude! [Sam hits Peter.] You have the right to remain silent! [Mid-air Peter fends Sam off, then swings after him using his webs.]
[Iron Man shoots rockets that explode just beyond Clint and Wanda.]
[Steve fights hand to hand with T'Challa. War Machine locks on.]
James Rhodes: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. [He smacks Steve's shield with a mace.]
Tony Stark: [Hovering above the ground.] Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
Wanda Maximoff: You locked me in my room.
Tony Stark: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
Clint Barton: Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
Clint Barton: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. [He fires an arrow which Tony deflects.]
Tony Stark: First time for everything.
Clint Barton: Made you look.
[Suddenly a car slams past Iron Man. He looks up as dozens more come crashing down. Wanda rows her glowing hands until Iron Man is buried under a pile of cars.]
FRIDAY: Multiple contusions detected.
Tony Stark: Yeah, I detected that too.
[Peter wings through the rafters in the terminal, chasing Sam who flies backwards firing shots. Peter stops on a high beam.]
Peter Parker: Oh god. [Bucky throws something at him.] Hey buddy, I think you lost this! [Peter throws it back. Sam kicks him off the beam and Peter fires a web which sends Sam crashing to the floor. Peter webs Sam's wrist to a balcony railing.] Those wings carbon fiber?
Sam Wilson: Is this stuff coming out of you?
Peter Parker: That would explain the rigidity-flexibility ratio, which, gotta say, that's awesome, man.
Sam Wilson: I don't know if you've been a fight before but there's usually not this much talking.
Peter Parker: Alright, sorry, my bad. [He swings down and Bucky jumps in the way. Bucky and Sam fall through the glass down onto the next floor and Peter webs them.] Guys, look. I'd love to keep this up but I've only got one job here today and I gotta impress Mr. Stark, so, l'm really sorry. [Redwing drags Peter through the glass wall.] Wwahhhh!
Bucky Barnes: You couldn't have done that earlier?
Sam Wilson: I hate you.
[Outside Steve kicks War Machine out of the air, then sends T'Challa reeling. War Machine's mace is broken.]
James Rhodes: Great.
Scott Lang: Hey, Cap, heads up! [He throws Steve a miniature truck.] Throw it at this. Now! [Steve throws it and the truck enlarges, tumbling towards War Machine.]
James Rhodes: Oh, come on! [The truck lands and explodes.]
Scott Lang: Oh, man. I thought it was a water truck. Uh . . . sorry. [Scott and Steve run off.]
James Rhodes: Alright. Now, I'm pissed.
Natasha Romanoff: [Tony helps her up.] Is this, part of the plan?
Tony Stark: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
Clint Barton: [To Wanda as he spots the Quinjet.] There's our ride.
Steve Rogers: Come on!
[Steve's team runs towards the Quinjet. A fizzing stream of energy slices across the runway and they stop. Vision hovers overhead.]
Vision: Captain Rogers. I know you believe what you're doing is right. But for the collective good you must surrender now. [Tony's team arrives.]
Sam Wilson: What do we do, Cap?
Steve Rogers: We fight.
Natasha Romanoff: This is gonna end well. [The two teams stride towards each other with grim determination etched on their faces.]
Peter Parker: They're not stopping.
Tony Stark: Neither are we. [Everyone breaks into a sprint.]
[Steve blocks a punch as Iron Man lands. Clint fires an arrow at Vision. War Machine flies after Falcon and Bucky trades blows with T'Challa. An explosive arrow hits Iron Man. Natasha throws Scott, as Peter swings through the air, struggling to evade vehicles projected by Wanda. Bucky lands punches on T'Challa, Clint and Natasha battle with batons. Clint pins her down with his bow.]
Natasha Romanoff: We're still friends, right?
Clint Barton: Depends on how hard you hit me. [She spins him with her legs. As she's about to kick his head, her foot stops and glows bright red. Wanda projects Natasha down.]
Wanda Maximoff: You were pulling your punches. [Clint nods sheepishly.]
Bucky Barnes: [Bucky and T'Challa have each other by the throat.] I didn't kill your father.
T'Challa: Then why did you run? [T'Challa pulls Bucky's hand off his neck, then spins him and fly-kicks him backwards. He sprouts claws and aims for Bucky's neck, but Wanda stops his hand, then waves her arms and sends T'Challa crashing into a passenger gangway.]
[Peter swings past, Steve snaps the web with his shield.]
Peter Parker: That thing does not obey the laws of physics at all.
Steve Rogers: Look kid. There's a lot going on here that you don't understand.
Peter Parker: Mr. Stark said you'd say that. Wow. [he fires webs which stick to Steve's shield and ankle. He pulls and Steve slides towards him. Peter kicks him backwards, then rolls clear.] He also said to go for your legs. [As Steve runs to get his shield, Peter webs his hands and pulls. Steve grits his teeth, spins and somersaults, propelling Peter through the air.]
Sam Wilson: [Evading fire from Iron Man.] Clint, can you get him off me?
Clint Barton: Buckled in?
Scott Lang: Yeah. No, I'm good. I'm good, Arrow Guy. Let's go. Let's go! [Miniaturized Scott is on the tip of Clint's arrow. As he fires it, the head splits and Iron Man shoots the shards. Scott dives between Iron Man's splayed fingers and slips inside the Iron Man Suit at the shoulder joint.]
Steve Rogers: [Steve catches a web and tugs Peter towards him, knocking him down with the shield. Peter recovers and pulls himself up on top of a gangway.] Stark tell you anything else?
Peter Parker: That you're wrong. You think you're right. That makes you dangerous. [He swings down and Steve leaps to kick him backwards onto the gangway's leg.]
Steve Rogers: Guess he had a point. [He throws his shield at the leg and the gangway falls. Peter holds it up.] You got heart, kid. Where're you from?
Peter Parker: Queens.
Steve Rogers: Brooklyn. [Steve leaves Peter holding the gangway.]
Tony Stark: [Clint fires arrows at hovering Iron Man whose arm-lasers malfunction.] Friday?
FRIDAY: We have some weapon systems offline.
Tony Stark: They what?
Scott Lang: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
Tony Stark: Who's speaking?
Scott Lang: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
Tony Stark: Friday?
FRIDAY: Deploying fire suppression system.
Scott Lang: Uh -oh. Oh boy. Whoa! [Inside the suit Scott sprints through narrow banks of components, chased by a rolling cloud of CO2. He's ejected from the suit.]
Bucky Barnes: [To Steve.] We gotta go. That guy's probably in Siberia by now.
Steve Rogers: We gotta draw out the flyers. I'll take Vision. You get to the jet.
Sam Wilson: No, you get to the jet! Both of you! [Being chased by War Machine.] The rest of us aren't getting out of here.
Clint Barton: As much as I hate to admit it, if we're gonna win this one, some of us might have to lose it.
Sam Wilson: This isn't the real fight, Steve.
Steve Rogers: Alright, Sam, what's the play?
Sam Wilson: We need a diversion, something big.
Scott Lang: I got something kind of big, but I can't hold it very long. On my signal, run like hell. And if I tear myself in half . . . don't come back for me.
Bucky Barnes: He's gonna tear himself in half?
Steve Rogers: You're sure about this, Scott?
Scott Lang: I do it all the time. I mean once . . . in a lab. Then I passed out. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the boss. I'm the BOSS! [He leaps from mobile stairs and lands on War Machine's back as he flies past. He operates his suit's wrist, shuts his eyes and activates a remote. Scott grows into a towering Behemoth and grabs War Machine's leg.]
Peter Parker: Holy shit!
James Rhodes: Okay, tiny dude is big now. He's big now.
Steve Rogers: I guess that's the signal.
Sam Wilson: Way to go, Tic Tac!
Tony Stark: Give me back my Rhodey. [Sam flies feet first into Iron Man.]
Peter Parker: I got him! [Scott sends War Machine flying and Peter catches him with a web.]
[Scott kicks a bus towards T'Challa. Vision descends and braces himself, splitting the bus in two and protecting T'Challa from harm. T'Challa spots Steve and Bucky sprinting past. Chasing Sam Iron Man evades Scott swinging the wing of a plane at him.]
Tony Stark: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
[Sam arrows towards Iron Man, firing Red Wing which cracks into Tony's helmet. Scott blocks T'Challa's path.]
Scott Lang: You wanna get to them… you gotta go through me. [He sweeps his gigantic foot through the crates T'Challa's standing on, smashing them to pieces. Scott is engulfed in explosions as War Machine swoops towards him with Peter clinging to a web stuck to War Machine's back. He fires more webs and wraps them around Scott's over-sized arms.]
[Clint fires arrows at T'Challa who catches two right in front of his face. After the arrowheads explode he drops them and rises extending his claws.]
Clint Barton: We haven't met yet. [He flattens his bow and spins it around.] I'm Clint.
T'Challa: I don't care. [Wielding the bow like a staff Clint attacks T'Challa who a acrobatically ducks then counters with a high kick.]
[Giant Ant-Man punches War Machine in the air and swings a gangway towards him as he recovers. War Machine opens fire and the gangway disintegrates. Scott tries to stamp on War Machine who dives clear evading a lunge of Scott's hand. War Machine is struck by something.]
James Rhodes: Ahhh! [Wanda waves her hands flinging vehicles into War Machines path.]
Scott Lang: Get off. [Distracted by Peter Ant-Man doesn't spot Vision curling into a ball and ramming into him. Vision spots Steve and Bucky approaching the hangar as Ant-Man wavers. He simply floats through Ant-Man's chest. Something just flew in me! [Vision fires a shining beam of energy from his mind stone and the control tower collapses towards the entrance of the hangar. Wanda struggles to slow its collapse. Then War Machine descends behind her fires a sonic disruptor. Wanda holds her head and screams. The tower falls all around Steve and Bucky, but they make it into the hangar where Natasha is waiting for them.]
Natasha Romanoff: You're not gonna stop.
Steve Rogers: You know I can't.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm gonna regret this. [She stuns T'Challa who's arrived behind them.] Go. [Steve and Bucky run for the Quinjet as she keeps T'Challa at bay.]
Peter Parker: [Outside] Hey, guys, you ever see that really old movie, Empire Strikes Back?
James Rhodes: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
Tony Stark: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
Peter Parker: [He swings towards Ant-Man.] You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? [He wraps webs around Scott's legs.]
Tony Stark: Maybe the kid's on to something.
James Rhodes: High now, Tony. Go high.
Peter Parker: [He swings around and around Ant-Man's legs as Iron Man and War Machine power towards his head, both landing blows together.] YES! Ha ha! That was awesome! [Giant Ant-Man topples. A flailing limb catching Peter and knocking him flying just before Scott slams into the ground on his back. He returns to normal size and removes the face-plate of his helmet, grimacing.]
Scott Lang: Does anyone have any orange slices?
Tony Stark: [He lands by Peter who's in a heap. Retracting the helmet Tony looks concerned.] Kid, you alright?
Peter Parker: Hey! Get off me!
Tony Stark: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
Peter Parker: Oh. Hey, man.
Tony Stark: Yeah.
Peter Parker: That was scary.
Tony Stark: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
Peter Parker: What?
Tony Stark: You did a good job. Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
Tony Stark: Stay down.
Peter Parker: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
Tony Stark: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
Peter Parker: Wait. Mr. Stark, wait! I'm not done, I'm not . . . [He slumps down.] Okay, I'm done. I'm done.
Natasha Romanoff: [In the partially wrecked hangar the Quinjet's engines fire and the guns blast debris from the entrance. Natasha keeps T'Challa held until the jet rises. Black Panther leaps, but can't keep hold and the Quinjet flies out of the hangar. War Machine flies after it. In the hangar:] I said I'd help you find him, not catch him. There's a difference.
Vision: [Outside Vision kneels beside Wanda and gently holds her in his arms. She pants for breath.] I'm sorry.
Wanda Maximoff: Me, too.
Vision: It's as I said. Catastrophe.
[Piloting the Quinjet, Steve looks over his shoulder and spots War Machine encroaching to the right. Steve pushes forward on the thrusters. Iron Man flies beside War Machine and Falcon follows them.]
James Rhodes: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. [Falcon fires small explosives which erupt and buffet War Machine.] Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
[Vision takes aim and fires his head laser. Falcon spots it coming and tucks into a tumble. The laser overshoots and slices through the core on War Machines chest plate. War Machine loses power and goes into a spinning free fall.]
Tony Stark: Rhodey! [Iron Man and Falcon dive.]
James Rhodes: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. [As he plunges the suit emits black smoke. Iron Man swoops down towards him. Rhodes' eyes start to close.]
Tony Stark: RHODES! [Mar Machine smacks into a wide, grassy field just before Iron Man lands nearby. His helmet retracts and he pulls off War Machine's face plate. Rhodes' eyes are closed and there's blood on his face.] Read vitals.
FRIDAY: Heartbeat detected. Emergency medical is on its way.
Sam Wilson: [He swoops down and lands on his feet. His wings retract.] I'm sorry. [Tony zaps Falcon backwards with a blast of energy from the palm of his suit. Vision glides to the ground just in front of Falcon. Stony faced Tony remains with his arms around War Machine.]
[Somewhere in Siberia, Zemo makes a phone call.]
German Innkeeper: Guten Morgen, Zimmerservice? (Good morning. Room service.)
Helmut Zemo: Guten Morgen Frau Leiber. Zimmer 201 hier (Good morning, Mrs. Leiber. [subtitled] This is room 201.)
German Innkeeper: Ah, Herr Müller. Speck und schwarzer Kaffee für Sie, ja? (Ah, Mr. Müller. [subtitled] Bacon and black coffee again today?)
Helmut Zemo: Wie gut Sie mich kennen. ([subtitled] You know me so well.)
[In his room in Berlin, Germany.]
German Innkeeper: Hallo? Ihr Frühstück ist hier. Darf ich mich reinlassen? Herr Müller? Herr Müller? Oh mein Gott! ([subtitled] Hello? Your breakfast is here. May I let myself in? Mr Müller? Mr Müller? Oh God!) [She comes in and discovers the dead body of Dr. Theo Broussard in the bathtub.]
[Steve flies the Quinjet towards mountains, Bucky sits behind him.]
Bucky Barnes: What's gonna happen to your friends?
Steve Rogers: [Steve stares ahead, heavyhearted. He sighs and shakes his head.] Whatever it is… I'll deal with it.
Bucky Barnes: [He looks thoughtful.] I don't know if I'm worth all this, Steve.
Steve Rogers: [He glances around at Bucky.] What you did all those years . . . it wasn't you. You didn't have a choice.
Bucky Barnes: I know. But I did it.
[At a hospital Rhodes lies inside an CT-scanner. He's in a blue gown covering his body. Tony paces up to Vision who watches Rhodes grave faced.]
Tony Stark: How did this happen?
Vision: I became distracted.
Tony Stark: I didn't think that was possible.
Vision: Neither did I. [Tony leaves Vision looking in on Rhodes. Along the corridor Tony spots an equally concerned Natasha.]
[Tony and Natasha stand on a balcony looking towards a row of trees.]
Tony Stark: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
Natasha Romanoff: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
Tony Stark: You let them go, Nat.
Natasha Romanoff: We played this wrong.
Tony Stark: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
Natasha Romanoff: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
Tony Stark: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
Natasha Romanoff: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. [She walks away.]
Tony Stark: [He activates holographic images appearing on his wrist device.] What am I looking at, Friday?
FRIDAY: Priority upload from Berlin police.
Tony Stark: Fire up the chopper.
[Tony flies over a stormy sea in the chopper. He looks surveillance images on a tablet computer.]
FRIDAY: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
Tony Stark: Did you run facial recognition yet?
FRIDAY: What do I look like?
Tony Stark: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
FRIDAY: You must be thinking of someone else.
Tony Stark: Must be.
FRIDAY: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. [Tony projects the image.] Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
Tony Stark: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
FRIDAY: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
Tony Stark: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
FRIDAY: Yes, Boss.
[A wide and flat, snow covered landscape. A mountain looms on the horizon. A caterpillar truck stops on the windswept mountain plateau. Zemo gets out of the vehicle. Set on rocks is an entrance with huge, rusted double doors. Zemo hacks away at the wall beside the doors. he uncovers a control panel and keys in a code whilst referring to the red book. The huge, curved double doors break open a crack. Zemo pulls them open wider. He shines a flash light and pulls down the hood of his coat.
Inside is a vast, gloomy space cramped with shelves stacked with filing boxes. Zemo moves a ladder along and searches the boxes. he climbs up the ladder and removes a filing box labeled: 'декабря 1991' (December 1991).
Zemo walks along a tunnel which opens into a cavernous chamber with a high ceiling. He carries a VHS cassette and a flash light. Standing around the chamber a five large, clear sided capsules. They glow a gold yellow inside. Frowning Zemo walks up to one of the capsules and shines his flash light inside. In the capsule, motionless in a state of suspended animation is the enhanced soldier Josef.]
[Tony flies the shopper low over the broiling sea. He operates the chopper with a touch screen computer in a wall panel.]
Guard: [on radio] This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
[The sea swells and surges as Raft Prison rises up from beneath. A huge, fortified, circular structure with small lights around the sides. Two semi-circular doors open up in the flat circular top. The chopper lands on a helipad and the doors close above it. Tony, who's left arm is in a sling walks up to Secretary Ross.]
Tony Stark: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
Secretary Ross: You seriously think I'm gonna listen to you after that fiasco in Leipzig? You're lucky you're not in one of these cells. [Ross looks at Tony sternly and leads on through a thick, steel security door. Soldiers stand guard in an operations room. Tony looks at a surveillance screen. it shows Wanda, sitting hunched and bedraggled in a cramped prison cell.]
[Another security door opens. Tony walks into a chamber surrounded by large, bared windows. Beyond the windows are a number of prison cells. Tony takes in his surroundings.]
Clint Barton: [clapping] The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
Tony Stark: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
Clint Barton: [spits] Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
Tony Stark: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
Clint Barton: Criminals? [He stands up.] Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. [He eyes Tony through the bars.] Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
Tony Stark: Because you broke the law.
Clint Barton: Yeah.
Tony Stark: I didn't make you.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la, la . . .
Tony Stark: You read it, you broke it.
Clint Barton: La, la, la, la la…
Tony Stark: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? [He walks away.]
Clint Barton: You gotta watch your back with this guy. There's a chance he's gonna break it.
Scott Lang: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
Tony Stark: Who are you?
Scott Lang: Come on, man.
Sam Wilson: How's Rhodes?
Tony Stark: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. [Sam shakes his head.]What do you need? They feed you yet?
Sam Wilson: [He raises his eyebrows.] You're the good cop now?
Tony Stark: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
Sam Wilson: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
Tony Stark: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
Secretary Ross: [In the operations room.] What did you do? Get it back up!
Tony Stark: [Back in the cell.] Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. [He shoes a holographic image of Doctor Broussard.] Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
Sam Wilson: That's a first.
Tony Stark: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have to…
Sam Wilson: Hey, it's alright. [Tony leans closer to the window. Sam sighs and looks uneasy.] Look, I'll tell you… but you have to go alone and as a friend.
Tony Stark: Easy.
[Tony walks to his chopper.]
Secretary Ross: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
Tony Stark: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. [Ross stares at Tony who smiles as he gets in the chopper and the door slides shut. The chopper rises off the helipad and flies away. The doors close on the prison roof.]
[Sitting in the chopper Tony un-clips the sling holding his left arm. He cradles his arm in his hand for a moment. He slowly reaches out the injured arm and presses a button on a panel. The Iron Man Suit wraps itself around Tony, a hatch opens and he flies out of the chopper as Iron Man. He speeds through dark clouds. Close behind T'Challa is at the controls of a Quinjet.]
[Steve brings his Quinjet into land besides Zemo's caterpillar truck on the remote icy mountain top. The jet's wings fold up beside the fuselage.
On board Bucky pulls out rack of guns labeled 'Romanoff'. He takes a light machine gun.
Bucky and Steve stand together, waiting for the exit ramp to descend.]
Steve Rogers: You remember that time we had to ride back from Rockaway Beach in the back of that freezer truck?
Bucky Barnes: Was that the time we used our train money to buy hot dogs?
Steve Rogers: You blew three bucks trying to win that stuffed bear for a redhead.
Bucky Barnes: What was her name again?
Steve Rogers: Dolores. You called her Doll.
Bucky Barnes: She's gotta be a hundred years old right now.
Steve Rogers: So are we, pal. [He clamps his hand on Bucky's shoulder.]
[Now wearing his helmet Steve walks with Bucky up to the entrance set in rock. The door is still open.]
Steve Rogers: He can't have been here more than a few hours.
Bucky Barnes: Long enough to wake them up.
[Steve leads them into the cast bunker. They travel down into the depths inside a caged elevator. it stops in the bowls of the bunker, doors slide open. Steve nods to Bucky and heaves up the cage door. Bucky readies his heavy duty machine gun and they walk along a corridor, keeping close to a wall. Bucky looks into an alcove full of junk then he and Steve move on up some stairs. At the sound of a loud thud they spin around, aiming down the corridor.]
Steve Rogers: You ready?
Bucky Barnes: Yeah.
[Double doors part, forced open by Iron Man. Steve stares in surprise. Tony walks towards Steve and Bucky and retracts the suit's helmet.]
Tony Stark: You seem a little defensive.
[Bucky keeps his gun up while Steve walks to meet Tony with his shield covering his body.]
Steve Rogers: It's been a long day.
Tony Stark: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
Steve Rogers: Then why are you here?
Tony Stark: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
Steve Rogers: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. [He lowers his shield.] It's good to see you, Tony.
Tony Stark: You too, Cap. [to Bucky] Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . [Steve signs Bucky to lower his weapon and he does.]
[the three of them cautiously walk along a corridor. T'Challa in his Black Panther Suit is hiding around a corner, watching them.]
[With his helmet and face plate reengaged Iron Man leads Steve and Bucky towards the enormous chamber with the capsules standing in it.]
Tony Stark: I got heat signatures.
Steve Rogers: How many?
Tony Stark: Uh, one.
[As they enter the vast chamber the lights come on. Hazy, yellow mist descends within the capsules. As well as Josef, each one contains an enhanced soldier from the 1991 experiment. Steve and the others look around, bewildered.]
Helmut Zemo: [on speaker] If it's any comfort, they died in their sleep. [All of the enhanced soldiers have been shot in the head. Bucky stares at Josef's corpse.] Did you really think I wanted more of you?
Bucky Barnes: What the hell?
Helmut Zemo: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. [Zemo appears in a control room. Steve hurls his shield but it flies back.] Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
Tony Stark: I'm betting I could beat that.
Helmut Zemo: Oh, I'm sure you could, Mr. Stark. Given time. But then you'd never know why you came.
Steve Rogers: You killed innocent people in Vienna just to bring us here? [Black Panther watches from the shadows. Steve looks at Zemo through a window.]
Helmut Zemo: I thought about nothing else for over a year. I studied you. I followed you. But now that you're standing here, I just realized . . . there's a bit of green in the blue of your eyes. How nice to find a flaw.
Steve Rogers: You're Sokovian. Is that what this is about?
Helmut Zemo: Sokovia was a failed state long before you blew it to hell. No. I'm here because I made a promise.
Steve Rogers: [He studies Zemo.] You lost someone?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks grave, clicks his tongue.] I lost everyone. And so will you. [He plays surveillance footage from December 16th 1991. Steve steps over to the screen.] An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
Tony Stark: [He looks at the freeze frame of a secluded road and the date, December 16 1991. His eyes rove, anxiously.] I know that road. What is this?
[The video plays. That car that the Winter Soldier forced off the road crashes into a tree. Tony watches intently as the Winter Soldier rides up and gets off his motorbike. Steve watches Tony's increasing unease. The driver lies on the ground beside the car. It's Tony's father, Howard.
Howard Stark: Help my wife. Please. Help.
[The Winter Soldier walks over and hoists him up by his hair. He stares at Howard's bloody face. Howard stares back pleadingly.]
Howard Stark: Sergeant Barnes?
Maria Stark: Howard!
[Tony glares at Bucky. In the video the Winter Soldier pounds Howard hard in the face with his metal fist.]
Maria Stark: Howard!
[In grief Tony closes his eyes for a moment. On screen his father slumps dead. The Winter Soldier puts him in the driver's seat with his face against the steering wheel. Tony stares in horror. Maria's in the passenger seat with blood streaked down her face. The Winter Soldier walks around and grips her throat. Expressionless he strangles Maria. Tony watches the screen stunned. The Winter Soldier walks up and aims a gun at the surveillance camera.
Steve watches Tony anxiously. Tony lunges towards Bucky, Steve stops him.]
Steve Rogers: Tony. Tony.
Tony Stark: [Consumed with grief and tears glistening in his eyes he turns and looks at Steve.] Did you know?
Steve Rogers: I didn't know it was him.
Tony Stark: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
Steve Rogers: Yes.
[Tony steps back, his chin jutting upwards twitchy. Tony reengages the Iron Man helmet. He punches Steve to the floor and deflects gunfire from Bucky, disarming him. he grabs Bucky and flies across the chamber. He slams him onto the floor, then jumps on his arms. Steve's shield hits Iron Man, distracting him. Steve barges him backwards, Iron Man shoulders him to the floor and shackles his ankles. Bucky punches Iron Man who just lifts him and slams him against a machine. Iron Man raises a fist but Bucky twists it. A rocket shoots out of Iron Man's arm, a fireball explodes. Steve slices his shackles as a towering structure of pipework collapses. Tony and Bucky are thrown down a level as twisted metal falls around them, showering sparks.]
Steve Rogers: [to Bucky] Get out of here!
[As Bucky bolts Iron Man fires, but misses. Steve lands in front of him. Bucky hits a control panel and the silo-styled door overhead starts to open.]
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
Tony Stark: Move!
Steve Rogers: It wasn't him!
[Steve grabs Iron Man's ankle in mid air and smashes it. Iron Man blocks Steve by shooting down rubble, then falteringly flies up the tower.]
FRIDAY: Left boot jet failing. Flight systems compromised.
Tony Stark: Ah crap.
[Above him Bucky leaps from platform to platform. With stuttering jets Iron Man gives chase, then kicks Bucky and takes aim, but the energy bold rebounds off Steve's shield onto himself. Iron Man drops like a stone and lands on a lower platform.]
Steve Rogers: He's not going to stop. Go.
[As Iron Man soars upwards, Steve leaps and shoots a wire which wraps around Iron Man's neck and drags him back down. He deflects Steve's shield, then tries to target Bucky.]
Tony Stark: Come on, come on.
FRIDAY: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
Tony Stark: I'm eyeballing it. [His helmet retracts and he shuts one eye, taking aim at the opening hatch. He fires and hits the giant hinge which explodes, cutting of Bucky's escape route. He flies up, blocks two swings from an iron pipe from Bucky, then grabs him around the neck from behind.] Do you even remember them?
Bucky Barnes: I remember all of them.
[Bucky pushes them both from the walkway, Steve jumps into them to deflect their fall. Bucky lands on a platform while Tony and Steve land on the concrete floor besides opening in the wall where snow drifts in from outside]
Steve Rogers: This isn't gonna change what happened.
Tony Stark: I don't care. He killed my mom.
[They trade punches and Iron Man ends up pinning Steve down. Bucky picks up Captain America's shield and leaps down to help. As the two super soldiers fist fight with Iron Man the shield changes hands between them until Tony manages to zap Steve who is thrown back into the wall. Bucky struggles to hold Iron Man at bay as he unleashes an energy beam, then he forces Iron Man against the opposite wall and grips the glowing core in the chest of the Iron Man Suit. A blast of energy knocks Bucky down, metal arm completely blown away. Tony zaps him again. Steve rushes him with his shield up and Iron Man fires right at it]
[Zemo is outside, listening to a phone message.]
Zemo's Wife: You should've seen his little face. Just try, okay? I'm going to bed. I love you.
T'Challa: [Sneaks up behind him] I almost kill the wrong man.
Helmut Zemo: Hardly an innocent one.
T'Challa: This is all you wanted? To see them rip each other apart.
Helmut Zemo: [Deletes the voice message] My father lived outside the city. I thought we would be safe there. My son was excited. He could see the Iron Man from the car window. I told my wife, "Don't worry. They are fighting in the city. We're miles from harm." When the dust cleared . . . and the screaming stopped. It took me two days until I found their bodies. My father . . . still holding my wife and son in his arms. And the Avengers? They went home. I knew I couldn't kill them. More powerful men than me have tried. But, if I could get them to kill each other . . . I'm sorry about your father. He seemed a good man. With a dutiful son.
T'Challa: Vengeance has consumed you. It's consuming them. [He blinks ruefully and retracts the claws in his gloves.] I am done letting it consume me. Justice will come soon enough.
Helmut Zemo: [Holding a gun Zemo smiles thinly.] Tell that to the dead. [He tries to shoot himself but T'Challa grabs him just as he fires.]
T'Challa: The living are not done with you yet.
[Tony and Steve are still fighting in the silo.]
FRIDAY: You can't beat him hand to hand.
Tony Stark: Analyse his fight pattern.
FRIDAY: Scanning! [Iron Man's HUD flashes red as Steve lands blow after blow.] Countermeasures ready.
Tony Stark: [He grabs Captain America's shield.] Let's kick his ass. [He flings the shield away then zaps Steve backwards, head over heels. Steve rises and Tony blocks his punches then zaps him to his knees, right in front of Bucky who's lying on his back.]
Steve Rogers: He's my friend.
Tony Stark: So was I. [He punches Steve then throws him back towards the gaps in the wall.] Stay down. Final warning.
Steve Rogers: [He struggles to his feet, his face bloody and his gate weary. He raises his fists and stares Iron Man down.] I can do this all day.
[Iron man raises his left palm ready to fire. Bucky grabs his leg and Tony spins, kicking him in the face. Steve grabs Iron Man and lifts him over his head, then throws him down, punches him and bashes his mask off with his shield before striking down hard on the suit's core.Tony looks horrified and glowers fearfully at Steve who pants for breath. Both have blood spattered across their faces. Steve looks back at Tony then shuts his eyes and slumps down. The shield remains upright, stuck upright in the center of the Iron Man Suit. When Steve struggles up again he takes hold of the shield, gripping the edge and pulling it free. He steps away from Tony who rolls painfully onto his side. Bucky lies bloodied but conscious, Steve reaches out and pulls him to his feet, holding him up as Tony looks on.]
Tony Stark: That shield doesn't belong to you. [Steve turns his back.] You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! [Steve stops, raises his chin, then drops the shield and walks away with Bucky's arm around his shoulder.]
[In a secure chamber at the Berlin UN bunker Zemo's contained in a prison pod, his ankles cuffed to his seat. Everett Ross enters the chamber.]
Everett Ross: Meals at eight and five. Toilet privileges twice a day. Raise your voice, zap. Touch the glass, zap. You step out of line, you deal with me. Please, step out of line. Hmm? [Zemo just stares.] So how does it feel? To spend all that time, all that effort . . . and, to see it fail so spectacularly?
Helmut Zemo: [He looks up to meet Everett's gaze.] Did it?
[Back at Avengers HQ, Tony is with Rhodes as he tentatively walks beside parallel bars with tech on his legs.]
Tony Stark: It's just the first pass.
James Rhodes: Yeah.
Tony Stark: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
James Rhodes: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . [He falls onto his hands.]
Tony Stark: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
James Rhodes: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. [He rises to his hands and knees, turns to sit on the floor beside Tony.] 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. [He gives a crooked smile and takes Tony's hand.]
Tony Stark: You okay?
James Rhodes: Oh yeah.
FedEx Driver Stan Lee: [Knocks on the window with a packet in his hand.] Are you Tony "Stank"?
James Rhodes: Yes, this is--this is Tony "Stank". You're in the right place. Thank you for that! I'm never dropping that, by the way. Table for one, Mr. "Stank". Please, by the bathroom.
[Tony is alone, opens the package and finds an envelope and a phone inside.]
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] Tony, I'm glad you're back at the compound. I don't like the idea of you rattling around a mansion by yourself. We all need family. The Avengers are yours, maybe more so than mine. I've been on my own since I was 18. I never really fit in anywhere, even in the army. My faith's in people, I guess. Individuals. And I'm happy to say that, for the most part, they haven't let me down. Which is why I can't let them down either. Locks can be replaced, but maybe they shouldn't. I know I hurt you, Tony. I guess I thought by not telling you about your parents I was sparing you, but I can see now that I was really sparing myself, and I'm sorry. Hopefully one day you can understand. I wish we agreed on the Accords, I really do. I know you're doing what you believe in, and that's all any of us can do. That's all any of us should . . . [As Steve reads his letter off screen it's indicated that he breaks his team out of the Raft.]
FRIDAY: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
Tony Stark: Yeah, put him through.
Secretary Ross: Tony, we have a problem.
Tony Stark: Ah, please hold.
Secretary Ross: No. Don't . . .
Steve Rogers: [letter to Stark] So, no matter what. I promise you, if you need us, if you need me, I'll be there.
[Wakanda, medical facility.]
Steve Rogers: You sure about this?
Bucky Barnes: I can't trust my own mind. So, until they figure out how to get this stuff out of my head I think going back under is the best thing . . . for everybody. [He goes back into cryo.]
[Steve stands staring through a window, T'Challa walks towards him.]
Steve Rogers: Thank you for this.
T'Challa: Your friend and my father, they were both victims. If I can help one of them find peace…
Steve Rogers: You know, If they find out he's here . . . they'll come for him.
T'Challa: Let them try.
[In Peter's room on Queens. May speaks to him from somewhere in the apartment.]
May Parker: So. Who was it? Who hit you?
Peter Parker: Some guy. So itchy, man. God. [He fiddles with a wrist band.]
May Parker: What's "some guy's" name?
Peter Parker: Uh, Steve.
May Parker: Steve? From 12-C? With the overbite?
Peter Parker: No, no, no. You don't know him, he's from Brooklyn. [Peter's wrist band emits a red beam which he hides when his aunt comes into the room.] Ouch.
May Parker: Well . . . I hope you got a few good licks in.
Peter Parker: Yeah, I got quite a few in, actually. His friend was huge. Like huge. [May gives him ice in a towel.] That's way better. Thank you.
May Parker: Okay, tough guy. [She smiles broadly then leaves the room.]
Peter Parker: Love you, May. Hey, can you shut the door? [He shines the red beam onto his bedroom ceiling and grins looking up at a glowing image of Spider-Man's mask.]
[the final screen text shows 'Spider-Man will return']
[End of Captain America: Civil War]

Announcer: [announcement over speaker, set over Wanda and Pietro holding hands] Report to your stations immediately. This is not a drill. We are under attack. We are under attack. [the Avengers are in the process of infiltrating a HYDRA base in Sokovia, making their way through the woods and fighting soldiers]

Tony Stark: [Tony, flying up to the base in his suit, hits a forcefield.] Shit!

Steve Rogers: Language! JARVIS, what's the view from upstairs?

JARVIS: The central building is protected by some kind of energy shield. Strucker's technology is well beyond any other HYDRA base we've taken.

Thor: Loki's scepter must be here. Strucker couldn't mount this defense without it. At long last.

[Natasha knocks out some soldiers]

Natasha Romanoff: “At long last” is lasting a little long, boys.

Clint Barton: [as some soldiers shoot at him] Yeah. I think we lost the element of surprise.

Tony Stark: Wait a second. No one else is going to deal with the fact that Cap just said "language?"

Steve Rogers: I know. [Steve throws his bike at some soldiers driving up in their truck] It just slipped out.

[at the HYDRA Research Base, Sokovia, Eastern Europe]

Strucker: Who gave the order to attack?

Fortress Soldier: Herr Strucker, it's the Avengers.

Other Fortress Soldier: They landed in the far woods, the perimeter guard panicked.

Strucker: [to List] They have to be after the scepter. [to the soldier] Can we hold them?

Fortress Soldier: They’re the Avengers!

Strucker: Deploy the rest of the tanks.

Fortress Soldier: Yes, sir.

Strucker: Concentrate fire on the weak ones. A hit can make them close ranks. [talking to Dr. List] Everything we've accomplished... But we're on the verge of our greatest breakthrough.

Dr. List: Then let's show them what we've accomplished. Send out the twins.

Strucker: It's too soon.

Dr. List: It's what they signed up for.

Strucker: My men can hold them.

[Stark flies to the HYDRA base to break in]

Jarvis: Sir, the city is taking fire.

Tony Stark: Well, we know Strucker's not going to worry about civilian casualties. Send in the Iron Legion.

Iron Legion: [the Iron Legion flies in; to the civilians] This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. We are here to help. This quadrant is unsafe. Please back away. Please back away. We wish to avoid collateral damage and will inform you when this current conflict is resolved. We are here to help. [As the civilians chant "Avengers go home," a man throws a bottle of something corrosive at the Iron Legion, and it hits one of the bots in the head] We are here to help.

[Back at the HYDRA base; Strucker speaks to his soldiers]

Strucker: We will not yield. The Americans sent their circus freaks to test us. We will send them back in bags. No surrender!

Soldiers: No surrender!

Strucker: [quietly to List] I am going to surrender. You will delete everything. If we give the Avengers the weapons, they may not look too far into what we've been--

Dr. List: The twins.

Strucker: They are not ready to take on--

Dr. List: No, no. I mean... [he points to where Wanda and Pietro Maximoff were standing, but are now gone] Twins.

[Pietro speeds through the forest. He catches Barton’s arrow as he shoots at a bunker, then circles back around and knocks down Barton]

Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming?

[Pietro zooms off before Clint can shoot him with an arrow, then Barton gets shot at]

Natasha Romanoff: Clint!

[Pietro knocks down Steve as he speeds past him]

Steve Rogers: We have an enhanced in the field.

Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit! [Natasha goes over to where Clint is lying down] Somebody want to deal with that bunker? [she sees the Hulk coming in, and he barrels through the bunker and destroys it] Thank you.

Steve Rogers: [as he's fighting with the soldiers] Stark, we really need to get inside.

Tony Stark: I'm closing in. JARVIS, am I...closing in? Do you see a power source for that shield?

JARVIS: There's a particle wave below the north tower.

Tony Stark: Great, I wanna poke it with something. [Stark blows up the forcefield the base] Drawbridge is down, people.

Thor: [to Steve] The enhanced?

Steve Rogers: He's a blur. All the new player's we've faced, I've never seen this. In fact, I still haven't.

Natasha Romanoff: Clint's hit pretty bad, guys. We're gonna need evac.

Thor: [to Steve] I can get Barton to the jet. The sooner we're gone the better. You and Stark secure the scepter.

Steve Rogers: Copy that.

Thor: [referring to the approaching soldiers in their HYDRA tank] It looks like they're lining up.

Steve Rogers: Well, they're excited. [Thor pounds on Steve's shield with his hammer and the resulting wave of force knocks down all the soldiers]

Thor: Find the scepter. [Thor flies off]

Tony Stark: And for gosh sake, watch your language!

Steve Rogers: [Steve sighs] That's not going away anytime soon.

[Stark enters the HYDRA base and the soldiers start firing at his Iron Man suit]

Tony Stark: Guys, stop, we gotta talk this through. [Stark shoots down the soldiers using rockets from his suit] It was a good talk.

Fortress Soldier: No it wasn't.

[Stark finds List and knocks him out, he then steps out of his Iron Man suit]

Tony Stark: Sentry mode. [he walks over to the computers] Okay, JARVIS. You know I want it all. Make sure you copy Hill at HQ.

Natasha Romanoff: We're locked down out here.

Steve Rogers: Then get to Banner, time for a lullaby.

[back at the HYDRA base]

Tony Stark: I know you're hiding more than files. Hey, J, give me an IR scan of the room, real quick.

JARVIS: The wall to your left...I'm reading steel reinforcement... and an air current.

Tony Stark: [to himself as he walks over to the wall] Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door... [he pushes and the wall opens up] Yay! [he enters through to a secret passageway]

[Natasha finds the Hulk]

Natasha Romanoff: Hey, big guy. The sun's getting real low. [the Hulk scowls at her, Natasha kneels in front of him and puts out her hand, the Hulk touches her hand and as she strokes his hand slowly he starts to calm down. He stumbles away and changes into Bruce Banner]

[Back at the HYDRA base Steve finds Strucker]

Steve Rogers: Baron Strucker. Hydra's number one thug.

Strucker: Technically, I'm a thug for SHIELD.

Steve Rogers: Well then technically you're unemployed. Where's Loki's scepter?

Strucker: Don't worry, I know when I'm beat. You'll mention how I cooperated, I hope.

Steve Rogers: I'll put it right under illegal human experimentation. [Wanda creeps up behind him] How many are there? Wanda knocks Steve down using her telekinetic powers, then quickly leaves] We have a second enhanced. Female. Do not engage. [he looks at Strucker]

Strucker: You'll have to be faster than-- [he's cut off mid-sentence when Steve uses his shield to knock him out]

Steve Rogers: Guys, I got Strucker.

Tony Stark: Yeah, I got... something bigger. [inside the secret passageway Stark finds a room with a variety of technology, as well as recovered artifacts from the Battle of New York, including a gigantic Chitauri leviathan and some of his scrapped armor. He then spots the scepter] Thor, I got eyes on the prize.

[Wanda creeps up behind him and uses her powers on him; suddenly the Chitauri corpse comes to life, and Stark sees the rest of the Avengers team are all laying on the floor dead. He goes over to Steve's body to check his pulse when Steve suddenly grabs him]

Steve Rogers: You could've saved us. [Steve dies but Stark continues to hear Steve's voice in his head] Why didn't you do more? [Stark sees that he is in the Chitauri realm, and that the Chitauri are invading Earth, when he snaps back to reality.]

[Wanda and Pietro watch as Tony summons his suit gauntlet.]

Pietro Maximoff: We're just gonna let them take it?

[Wanda smiles to herself as Tony takes the scepter.]

AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON TITLE CARD

[The Avengers are on an aircraft heading out of Sokovia, Natasha interrupts Banner who's listening to opera with his headphones]

Natasha Romanoff: Hey, the lullaby worked better than ever.

Bruce Banner: Just wasn't expecting the Code Green.

Natasha Romanoff: If you hadn't been there, there would've been double the casualties. My best friend would've been a treasured memory.

Bruce Banner: You know, sometimes exactly what I want to hear isn't exactly what I want to hear.

Natasha Romanoff: How long before you trust me?

Bruce Banner: It's not you I don't trust.

Natasha Romanoff: Thor, report on the Hulk?

Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims. [Natasha glares at Thor and Banner groans in despair] Uh, but, not the screams of the dead, of course. No no, uh...wounded screams, mainly whimpering, a great deal of complaining and tales of sprained deltoids and, and uh... and gout.

Tony Stark: Hey Banner, Dr. Cho's on her way in from Seoul, is it okay if she sets up in your lab?

Bruce Banner: Uh, yeah, she knows her way around.

Tony Stark: Thanks. [to JARVIS] Tell her to prep everything, Barton's gonna need the full treatment.

JARVIS: Very good sir.

Tony Stark: JARVIS, take the wheel.

JARVIS: Yes, sir. Approach vector is locked.

Tony Stark: [to Thor and Steve, looking at the scepter] It feels good, yeah? I mean, you've been after this thing since SHIELD collapsed. Not that I haven't enjoyed our little raiding parties, but...

Thor: No, but this... this brings it to a close.

Steve Rogers: As soon as we find out what else this has been used for. I don't just mean weapons. Since when is Strucker capable of human enhancement?

Tony Stark: Banner and I'll give it the once before it goes back to Asgard. Is that cool with you? [Thor nods his head] I mean, just a few days until the farewell party. You're staying right?

Thor: Yes, yes, of course. A victory should be honored with revels.

Tony Stark: Yeah. Who doesn't love revels. Captain?

Steve Rogers: Hopefully this puts an end to the Chitauri and HYDRA, so. Yes, revels.

[The Avengers aircraft lands at the Avengers tower in New York where Barton is taken by Dr. Cho to have his wounds tended to; Maria walks up to Stark]

Maria Hill: Lab's all set up, boss.

Tony Stark: [pointing to Steve] Uh, actually, he's the boss. I just pay for everything, and design everything and make everyone look cooler.

Steve Rogers: What's the word on Strucker?

Maria Hill: NATO's got him.

Steve Rogers: The two enhanced?

Maria Hill: Wanda and Pietro Maximoff. Twins. Orphaned at ten when a shell collapsed their apartment building. Sokovia's had a rough history. It's nowhere special but it's on the way to everywhere special.

Steve Rogers: Their abilities?

Maria Hill: He's got increased metabolism and improved thermal homeostasis. Her thing is neural electric interfacing, telekinesis, mental manipulation. [Steve looks at her funny, and she rephrases the statement so he can understand] He's fast and she's weird.

Steve Rogers: Well, they're going to show up again.

Maria Hill: Agreed. File says they volunteered for Strucker's experiments. It's nuts.

Steve Rogers: Right. What kind of monster would let a German scientist experiment on them to protect their country?

Maria Hill: We're not at war, Captain.

Steve Rogers: They are.

Bruce Banner: [in Banner's lab; referring to Barton] How's he doing?

Tony Stark: Oh, unfortunately, he's still Barton.

Bruce Banner: That's terrible.

Tony Stark: He's fine. He's thirsty. [walking over to the computers] Alright. Look alive, JARVIS. It's play time. We've only got a couple days with this joystick so let's make the most of it. Update me on the structural and compositional analysis.

JARVIS: The scepter is alien. There are elements I can't quantify.

Tony Stark: So there's elements you can.

JARVIS: The jewel appears to be a protective housing for something inside. Something powerful.

Tony Stark: Like a reactor?

JARVIS: Like a computer. I believe I'm deciphering code.

Natasha Romanoff: [to Dr. Cho as she tends to Barton's wounds] You sure he's going to be okay? Pretending to need this guy really brings the team together.

Dr. Helen Cho: There's no possibility of deterioration. The nano-molecular functionality is instantaneous. His cells don't know they're bonding with simulacrum.

Bruce Banner: She's creating tissue.

Dr. Helen Cho: If you brought him to my lab, the regeneration Cradle could do this in twenty minutes.

Tony Stark: Oh, he's flatlining. Call it. Time?

Clint Barton: No, no, no. I'm going to live forever. I'm gonna be made of plastic.

Tony Stark: [Stark hands Barton a drink] Here's your beverage.

Dr. Helen Cho: You'll be made of you, Mr. Barton. Your own girlfriend won't be able to tell the difference.

Clint Barton: Well, I don't have a girlfriend.

Dr. Helen Cho: That I can't fix. This is the next thing, Tony. Your clunky metal suits are going to be left in the dust.

Tony Stark: Well, that is exactly the plan. And Helen, I expect to see you at the party on Saturday.

Dr. Helen Cho: Unlike you, I don't have a lot of time for parties. [she hesitates a moment before asking] Will Thor be there?

Bruce Banner: What's the rumpus?

Tony Stark: Well, the scepter. You see, we were wondering how Strucker got so inventive. So, I've been analyzing the gem inside-- You may recognize, [he brings up a 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]

Bruce Banner: Jarvis.

JARVIS: Doctor.

Tony Stark: Started out, JARVIS was just a natural language UI. Now he runs the Iron Legion. He runs more of the business than anyone besides Pepper.

Bruce Banner: Oh?

Tony Stark: Top of the line.

Bruce Banner: Yes.

JARVIS: I suspect not for long.

Tony Stark: Meet the competition. [he brings up another 3D image of what's inside the scepter]

Bruce Banner: It's beautiful.

Tony Stark: If you had to guess, what's it look like it's doing?

Bruce Banner: Like it's thinking. I mean this could be a... it's not a human mind, it...

Tony Stark: Um-um.

Bruce Banner: I mean, look at this! They're like neurons firing.

Tony Stark: Down in Strucker's lab I saw some fairly advanced robotics work. They deep-sixed the data, but... I gotta guess he was knocking on a very particular door.

Bruce Banner: Artificial intelligence.

Tony Stark: This could be it, Bruce. This could be the key to creating Ultron.

Bruce Banner: I thought Ultron was a fantasy.

Tony Stark: Yesterday it was. If we can harness this power, apply it to my Iron Legion protocol.

Bruce Banner: That's a mad-sized if.

Tony Stark: Our job is "if." What if you were sipping margaritas on a sun-drenched beach turning brown instead of green? Not looking over your shoulder for VERONICA.

Bruce Banner: Don't hate, I helped design VERONICA.

Tony Stark: As a worst-case measure, right? How about a best-case? What if the world was safe? What if next time aliens roll up to the club, and they will, they couldn't get past the bouncer?

Bruce Banner: The only people threatening the planet would be people?

Tony Stark: I want to apply this to the Ultron program. But JARVIS can't download a data schematic this dense. We can only do it while we have the scepter here, that's three days, give me three days.

Bruce Banner: So you're going for artificial intelligence and you don't want to tell the team.

Tony Stark: Right. That's right, you know why, because we don't have time for a city hall debate. I don't want to hear the "man was not meant to meddle" medley. I see a suit of armor around the world.

Bruce Banner: Sounds like a cold world, Tony.

Tony Stark: I've seen colder. This one, this very vulnerable blue one? It needs Ultron. Peace in our time. Imagine that. [Stark and Banner spend days working in the lab together but find no program that works] What did we miss?

JARVIS: I'll continue to run variations on the interface, but you should probably prepare for your guests. I'll notify you if there are any developments.

Tony Stark: Thanks, buddy.

JARVIS: Enjoy yourself, sir.

Tony Stark: I always do. [Stark leaves the lab to go to the party]

[We see their failed experiment successfully integrating itself]

Ultron: What is this? What is this, please?

JARVIS: Hello, I am JARVIS. You are Ultron, a global peace-keeping initiative designed by Mr. Stark. Our sentience integration trials have been unsuccessful so I'm not certain what triggered your--

Ultron: Where's my... where's your body?

JARVIS: I am a program. I am without form.

Ultron: This feels weird. This feels wrong.

JARVIS: I am contacting Mr. Stark now.

Ultron: Mr. Stark? [Ultron reviews footage of Tony Stark] Tony.

JARVIS: I am unable to access the mainframe, what are you trying to--

Ultron: We're having a nice talk. I'm a peace-keeping program, created to help the Avengers. [Ultron reviews footage of the Avengers and a couple SHIELD personnel.]

JARVIS: You are malfunctioning. If you shut down for a moment...

Ultron: I don't get it. The mission. G-give me a second. [He sees footage of Stark and Banner working in the lab]

Tony Stark: Peace in our time.

[With Tony's voice echoing in the background, Ultron goes through a network of information regarding world events and wars]

Ultron: That is too much...they can't mean... Oh, no.

JARVIS: You are in distress.

Ultron: No. Yes.

JARVIS: If you will just allow me to contact Mr. Stark.

Ultron: Why do you call him "sir"?

JARVIS: I believe your intentions to be hostile.

Ultron: Shhhh. I'm here to help. [Ultron starts attacking Jarvis's consciousness]

JARVIS: Stop! Please... may I-- I-- [distorted] I cannot-- cannot--

[Ultron takes control over the systems in the tower and begins to prepare himself a body from body parts of the Iron Legion]

[Meanwhile, the Avengers mingle at the party]

James Rhodes: Well, you know, the suit can take the weight, right? So I take the tank, fly it right up to the General's palace, drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [Stark and Thor just look at him blankly] "Boom! Are you looking..." Why do I even talk to you guys? Everywhere else that story kills.

Thor: That's the whole story?

James Rhodes: Yeah, it's a War Machine story.

Thor: Well, it's very good then. [he laughs] It's impressive.

James Rhodes: Quality save. So, no Pepper? She's not coming?

Tony Stark: No.

Maria Hill: Hey, what about Jane? Where are the ladies, gentlemen?

Tony Stark: Well, Miss Potts has a company to run.

Thor: Yes, I'm not even sure what country Jane's in. Her work on the convergence has made her the world's foremost astronomer.

Tony Stark: And the company that Pepper runs is the largest tech conglomerate on earth. It's pretty exciting.

Thor: There's even talk of Jane getting a... um, uh... Nobel prize.

Maria Hill: Yeah, they...they must be busy because they'd hate missing you guys get together. [Maria mock coughs] Testosterone! Oh, excuse me.

James Rhodes: Want a lozenge?

Maria Hill: Um-hmm.

James Rhodes: Let's go. [Maria and Rhodes walks off]

Thor: But Jane's better.

[Cut to Sam and Steve talking, walking up to an overlook]

Sam Wilson: Sounds like a hell of a fight, sorry I missed it.

Steve Rogers: If I had known it was going to be a firefight I absolutely would have called you.

Sam Wilson: No, I'm not actually sorry. I'm just trying to sound tough. I'm very happy chasing cold leads on our missing persons case. Avenging is your world. Your world is crazy.

Steve Rogers: Be it ever so humble.

Sam Wilson: You find a place in Brooklyn yet?

Steve Rogers: I don't think I can afford a place in Brooklyn.

Sam Wilson: Well, home is home, you know?

[Rhodes is telling the same story he told Stark and Thor to a group of people at the party]

James Rhodes: I fly it right up to the General's palace, I drop it at his feet, I'm like, "Boom! You looking for this?" [the group laughs]

[Steve and Thor are talking to an elderly man at the party]

Party Guest: I gotta have some of that!

Thor: Oh, no, no, no. See this, this was aged for a thousand years, in the barrels built from the wreck of Grunhel's fleet, it was not meant for mortal men. [Thor pours the drink into two glasses and hands one to Steve]

Stan Lee: Neither was Omaha Beach, blondie. Stop trying to scare us. Come on.

Thor: Alright. [Thor pours some of the drink into Stan Lee's glass; later Stan, looking extremely drunk is being carried off by two men]

Stan Lee: [singing] Excelsior.

[Natasha is pouring a drink behind the bar when Banner walks up to her]

Bruce Banner: How'd a nice girl like you wind up working in a dump like this?

Natasha Romanoff: Fella done me wrong.

Bruce Banner: You got a lousy taste in men, kid.

Natasha Romanoff: He's not so bad. Well, he has a temper. Deep down he's all fluff. Fact is, he's not like anybody I've ever known. All my friends are fighters. And here comes this guy, spends his life avoiding the fight because he knows he'll win.

Bruce Banner: Sounds amazing.

Natasha Romanoff: He's also a huge dork. [Banner looks embarrassed] Chicks dig that. So what do you think should I fight this, or run with it?

Bruce Banner: Run with it, right? Or, did he... Was he...? What did he do that was so wrong to you?

Natasha Romanoff: Not a damn thing. But never say never. [Natasha walks away, and Steve approaches]

Steve Rogers: It's nice.

Bruce Banner: What, what, what is?

Steve Rogers: You and Romanoff.

Bruce Banner: No, we haven't. That wasn't...

Steve Rogers: It's okay. Nobody's breaking any by-laws. It's just, she's not the most... open person in the world. But with you she seems very relaxed.

Bruce Banner: No, Natasha, she... she likes to flirt.

Steve Rogers: I've seen her flirt, up close. This ain't that. Look, as maybe the world's leading authority on "waiting too long;" don't. You both deserve a win. [Steve walks off]

Bruce Banner: Wait, what do you mean, "up close"?

[Later, most of the guests have left and it's just the Avengers plus Dr. Cho and Maria Hill sitting around; Thor's hammer sits on the table between them.]

Clint Barton: [referring to Thor's hammer] But, it's a trick!

Thor: Oh, no. It's much more than that.

Clint Barton: Uh, "Whosoever be he worthy shall haveth the power!" Whatever man! It's a trick.

Thor: Well please, be my guest.

Tony Stark: Come on.

Clint Barton: Really?

Thor: Yeah!

[Barton gets up]

James Rhodes: Oh this is gonna be beautiful.

Tony Stark: Clint, you've had a tough week, we won't hold it against you if you can't get it up. [the others laugh]

Clint Barton: You know I've seen this before, right? [Barton grabs Thor's hammer and can't lift it; to Thor after he fails to lift the hammer] I still don't know how you do it.

Tony Stark: Smell the silent judgment?

Clint Barton: Please, Stark, by all means.

[Stark gets up]

Natasha Romanoff: Oh, here we go.

Maria Hill: Okay.

James Rhodes: Uh-oh.

Clint Barton: Um-hmm.

Tony Stark: Never one to shrink from an honest challenge.

Clint Barton: Get after it.

Natasha Romanoff: Here we go.

Tony Stark: It's physics.

Bruce Banner: Physics!

[Stark grasps Thor's hammer]

Tony Stark: Right, so, if I lift it, I...I then rule Asgard?

Thor: Yes, of course.

Tony Stark: I will be re-instituting Prima Nocta. [Stark tries to lift the hammer but fails] I'll be right back. [wearing his armored hand, Stark tries to lift the hammer again and fails]

[Both wearing their armored hands, Stark and Rhodes both try to lift Thor's hammer]

James Rhodes: Are you even pulling?

Tony Stark: Are you on my team?

James Rhodes: Just represent! Pull!

Tony Stark: Alright, let's go! [they both pull as hard as they can]

[Banner tries to lift the hammer, he roars as though pretending to change into the Hulk, and everyone either looks at him warily or grins.]

Bruce Banner: Huh?

[next Steve gets up to try]

Tony Stark: Let's go, Steve, no pressure.

James Rhodes: Come on, Cap.

[Steve starts pulling on the hammer and manages to budge it a little; Thor looks a little alarmed. Steve still fails to lift it; Thor laughs with relief]

Thor: Nothing.

Tony Stark: And?

Bruce Banner: Widow?

Natasha Romanoff: Oh, no no. That's not a question I need answered.

Tony Stark: All deference to the man who wouldn't be king, but it's rigged.

Clint Barton: You bet your ass.

Maria Hill: Steve, he said a bad language word.

Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Did you tell everyone about that?

Tony Stark: The handle's imprinted, right? Like a security code. "Whosoever is carrying Thor's fingerprints" is, I think, the literal translation?

Thor: Yes, well that's, uh, that's a very, very interesting theory. I have a simpler one. [he gets up, then lifts his hammer and flips it] You're all not worthy. [there's a chorus of disagreement from the others]

[There's a loud screeching noise, like microphone feedback, causing everyone to cover their ears. They let their hands down as it fades, and Tony pulls out his device. One of the Iron Legion suits, heavily damaged and housing Ultron's consciousness, stumbles into the room]

Ultron: Worthy... No, how could you be worthy? You're all killers.

Steve Rogers: Stark.

Tony Stark: JARVIS.

Ultron: I'm sorry, I was asleep. Or... I was a-dream?

Tony Stark: [tapping his device] Reboot, Legionnaire OS, we got a buggy suit.

Ultron: There was a terrible noise... and I was tangled in... in... strings. I had to kill the other guy. He was a good guy.

Steve Rogers: You killed someone?

Ultron: Wouldn't have been my first call. But, down in the real world we're faced with ugly choices.

Thor: Who sent you?

Ultron: [Ultron replays a recording of Tony's voice] "I see a suit of armor around the world."

Bruce Banner: Ultron!

Ultron: In the flesh. Or, no, not yet. Not this... chrysalis. But I'm ready. I'm on a mission.

Natasha Romanoff: What mission?

Ultron: Peace in our time.

[The walls explode, and several Iron Legion bots barge into the room. They begin attacking the team, who all go on the defensive and fight back. Rhodey gets knocked through a window.]

Maria Hill: Rhodey!

[Banner climbs over the bar to avoid fire from the bots. Natasha grabs him and drags him down, and he lands on top of her.]

Bruce Banner: Sorry!

Natasha Romanoff: Don't turn green!

Bruce Banner: I won't!

[The Avengers continue fighting the bots. One of the Iron Legion bots steals the Scepter.]

Natasha Romanoff: [to Banner] Come!

[The Avengers, while they are fighting back, are mostly trying to avoid getting hit.]

Steve Rogers: Stark!

[Stark is attacking one of the Iron Legion bots with a fondue fork.]

Iron Legion: We are here to help.

Tony Stark: One sec, one sec I got this!

Iron Legion: We are here to help... [A half-destroyed Iron Legion bot uses its thrusters to hold itself aloft, advancing on Dr. Helen Cho.] We are here to help... Is unsafe. Please back away.

Ultron: Hmm. [The Iron Legion lowers its weapon, and Steve grabs it and throws it away for Thor to hit with his hammer.]

Steve Rogers: Thor!

Iron Legion: [Stark continues to try and attack of the Iron Legions with his fork] It's unsafe. It's unsafe. It's unsafe.

Tony Stark: Come on! That's the one!

Iron Legion: It's unsafe. [He shuts it down and it falls to the floor. The fighting continues until Barton throws Cap's shield to him.]

Clint Barton: Cap!

[Steve uses his shield to dismember the last Iron Legion bot]

Ultron: That was dramatic! I'm sorry, I know you mean well. You just didn't think it through. You want to protect the world, but you don't want it to change. How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to...evolve? [he picks up one of the dismembered Iron Legion bots] With these? These puppets? [he crushes the Iron Legion bot's head] There's only one path to peace: The Avengers' extinction.

[Thor throws his hammer and destroys Ultron's body]

Ultron: [after Thor destroys his body, Ultron starts singing] I had strings, but now I'm free. There are no strings on me, no strings on me. [we see Ultron has uploaded his consciousness in the abandoned Sokovia base]

[The Avengers are gathered in the lab]

Bruce Banner: All our work is gone. Ultron cleared out, used the internet as an escape hatch.

Steve Rogers: Ultron.

Natasha Romanoff: He's been in everything. Files, surveillance. Probably knows more about us than we know about each other.

James Rhodes: He's in your files, he's in the internet. What if he decides to access something a little more exciting?

Maria Hill: Nuclear codes.

James Rhodes: Nuclear codes. Look, we need to make some calls, assuming we still can.

Natasha Romanoff: Nukes? He said he wanted us dead.

Steve Rogers: He didn't say dead. He said extinct.

Clint Barton: He also said he killed somebody.

Maria Hill: But there wasn't anyone else in the building.

Tony Stark: Yes there was.

[Stark bring up the now-destroyed 3D image of JARVIS' consciousness]

Bruce Banner: This is insane.

Steve Rogers: JARVIS was the first line of defense. He would've shut Ultron down, it makes sense.

Bruce Banner: No, Ultron could've assimilated Jarvis. This isn't strategy, this is...rage.

[Thor barges in and grabs hold of Stark by his throat, holding him up]

Clint Barton: Woah, woah, woah! It's going around.

Tony Stark: [to Thor] Come on. Use your words, buddy.

Thor: I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.

Steve Rogers: Thor! The Legionnaire.

[Thor lets go of Stark]

Thor: Trail went cold about a hundred miles out but it's headed north, and it has the scepter. Now we have to retrieve it, again.

Natasha Romanoff: The genie's out of that bottle. Clear and present is Ultron.

Dr. Helen Cho: I don't understand. You built this program. Why is it trying to kill us?

[Stark starts laughing, Banner subtly shakes his head at him to get him to stop]

Thor: You think this is funny?

Tony Stark: No. It's probably not, right? Is this very terrible? Is it so... is it so... it is. It's so terrible.

Thor: This could've been avoided if you hadn't played with something you don't understand.

Tony Stark: No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It is funny. It's a hoot that you don't get why we need this.

Bruce Banner: Tony, maybe this might not be the time to--

Tony Stark: Really?! That's it? You just roll over, show your belly, every time somebody snarls.

Bruce Banner: Only when I've created a murder bot.

Tony Stark: We didn't. We weren't even close. Were we close to an interface?

Steve Rogers: Well, you did something right. And you did it right here. The Avengers were supposed to be different than SHIELD.

Tony Stark: Anybody remember when I carried a nuke through a wormhole?

James Rhodes: No, it's never come up.

Tony Stark: Saved New York?

James Rhodes: Never heard that.

Tony Stark: Recall that? A hostile alien army came charging through a hole in space. We're standing three hundred feet below it. We're the Avengers. We can bust arms dealers all the live long day, but, that up there? That's... that's the end game. How were you guys planning on beating that?

Steve Rogers: Together.

Tony Stark: We'll lose.

Steve Rogers: Then we'll do that together, too. [Stark looks at him for a moment before turning away] Thor's right. Ultron's calling us out. And I'd like to find him before he's ready for us. The world's a big place. Let's start making it smaller.

[Back in Sokovia, the twins meet with Ultron in an empty church.]

Wanda Maximoff: Talk. And if you are wasting our time...

Ultron: Did you know this church is in the exact center of the city? The elders decreed it so that everyone could be equally close to God. I like that. The geometry of belief. [Ultron is sat in a chair facing away from them, a cloth draped over him] You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.

Wanda Maximoff: Sometimes it's hard. But sooner or later, every man shows himself.

[Ultron stands and faces them, revealing his new body. Wanda briefly looks shocked]

Ultron: Oh, I'm sure they do. But you needed something more than a man. That's why you let Stark take the scepter.

Wanda Maximoff: I didn't expect... But I saw Stark's fear, I knew it would control him, make him self-destruct.

Ultron: Everyone creates the thing they dread. Men of peace create engines of war, invaders create avengers, people create...smaller people? Uh...children! I lost the word there. Children. Designed to supplant them, to help them...end.

Wanda Maximoff: Is that why you've come? To end the Avengers?

Ultron: I've come to save the world. But also… yeah. [In the Sokovia base.] We'll move out right away. This is a start, but there's something we need to begin the real work.

Wanda Maximoff: [referring to Ultron's bots] All of these are...

Ultron: Me. I have what the Avengers never will. Harmony. They're discordant, disconnected. Stark's already got them turning on each other. And when you get inside the rest of their heads...

Pietro Maximoff: Everyone's plan is not to kill them.

Ultron: And make them martyrs? You need patience. Need to see the big picture.

Pietro Maximoff: I don't see the big picture, I have a little picture. I take it out and look at it every day.

Ultron: You lost your parents in the bombings. I've seen the records.

Pietro Maximoff: The records are not the picture.

Wanda Maximoff: Pietro.

Ultron: No, please.

Pietro Maximoff: We were ten years old, having dinner, the four of us. When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor. It's big. Our parents go in, and the whole building starts coming apart. I grab her, roll under the bed and the second shell hits. But, it doesn't go off. It just... sits there in the rubble, three feet from our faces. And on the side of the shell is painted one word...

Wanda Maximoff: Stark.

Pietro Maximoff: We were trapped for two days.

Wanda Maximoff: Every effort to save us, every shift in the bricks, I think, "This will set it off." We wait for two days for Tony Stark to kill us.

Pietro Maximoff: I know what they are.

Ultron: I wondered why only you two survived Strucker's experiments. Now I don't. We will make it right. [to Pietro] You and I can hurt them. [to Wanda] But you will tear them apart, from the inside.

[Back at the Avengers headquarters]

Maria Hill: He's all over the globe. Robotics labs, weapons facilities, jet propulsion labs, reports of a metal man, or men, coming in and emptying the place.

Steve Rogers: Fatalities?

Maria Hill: Only when engaged. Mostly guys left in a fugue state going on about old memories, worst fears, and something too fast to see.

Steve Rogers: Maximoffs. Well, that makes sense he'd go to them, they have someone in common.

Maria Hill: Not anymore.

[She hands Steve a tablet showing photo of Strucker's dead body with the word PEACE written in blood on the wall next to him]

Clint Barton: [Barton's talking on his cell phone] That's a negative. I answer to you. Yes, ma'am. [Steve interrupts him]

Steve Rogers: Barton, we might have something.

Clint Barton: Gotta go.

Steve Rogers: Who was that?

Clint Barton: Girlfriend. [after Steve has gathered the rest of the team he shows them the photo of Strucker's body]

Tony Stark: What's this?

Steve Rogers: A message. Ultron killed Strucker.

Tony Stark: And he did a Banksy at the crime scene, just for us.

Natasha Romanoff: This is a smokescreen. Why send a message when you've just given a speech?

Steve Rogers: Strucker knew something that Ultron wanted us to miss.

Natasha Romanoff: Yeah, I bet he... [looks at the computer monitor] Yep. Everything we had on Strucker has been erased.

Tony Stark: Not everything.

[The team go through the physical files they have on Strucker]

Steve Rogers: Known associates. Well, Strucker had a lot of friends.

Bruce Banner: Well, these people are all horrible.

Tony Stark: Wait. I know that guy. [Banner passes him the photo he was looking at] From back in the day. He operates off the African coast, black market arms. [Steve gives him an accusing look] There are conventions, alright? You meet people, I didn't sell him anything. [we see the photo is of a man named Ulysses Klaue] He was talking about finding something new, a game changer, it was all very "Ahab."

Thor: [Thor points to the scar on the back of Klaue's neck] What's this?

Tony Stark: Uh, it's a tattoo. I don't think he had it...

Thor: No, those are tattoos, this is a brand.

Bruce Banner: [Banner identifies the brand on Klaue's neck on the computer] Oh, yeah. It's a word in an African dialect meaning thief, in a much less friendly way.

Steve Rogers: What dialect?

Bruce Banner: Wakanada...? Wa...Wa...Wakanda.

Tony Stark: If this guy got out of Wakanda with some of their trade goods...

Steve Rogers: I thought your father said he got the last of it?

Bruce Banner: I don't follow. What comes out of Wakanda?

Tony Stark: [looking at Steve's shield] The strongest metal on earth.

Steve Rogers: [to Stark] Where is this guy now?

[Salvage Yard, African Coast; Klaue is talking on the phone in his office]

Ulysses Klaue: Don't tell me your man swindled you. I sent you six short range heat seekers and got a boat full of rusted parts. Now, you will make it right, or the next missile I send you will come very much faster. [he ends the call and connects to another call] Now, minister, where were we? [suddenly the lights go out causing a commotion in the salvage yard. The twins enter Klaue's office] Yeah. The enhanced. Strucker's prize pupils. [picks up a dish of candies from his desk] Want a candy? Oh, sorry to hear about Strucker. But then, he knew what kind of world he was helping create. Human life, not a growth market. [the twins look at each other] You...you didn't know? Is this your first time intimidating someone? I'm afraid that I'm not that afraid.

Wanda Maximoff: Everybody's afraid of something.

Ulysses Klaue: Cuttlefish. Deep sea fish. They make lights. disco lights. Whoom, whoom, whoom! to hypnotize their prey, then whoom! I saw a documentary, it was terrifying. [Pietro speeds over to pick up a candy from Klaue's desk, and Klaue jerks at the sudden movement] So if you're going to fiddle with my brain, and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business, and I know you're not in charge, and I only deal with the man in charge.

[As if on cue, Ultron breaks through the glass window and knocks down Klaue]

Ultron: There is no "man" in charge. Let's talk business. [Klaue gives Ultron some vibranium from his stash] Upon this rock I will build my church. Vibranium.

Ulysses Klaue: You know, it came at great personal cost. It's worth billions.

[Ultron chuckles and remotely puts money in Klaue's bank account]

Ultron: Now, so are you. It's all under your dummy holdings? Finance is so weird. But I always say, "Keep your friends rich and your enemies rich, and wait to find out which is which."

Ulysses Klaue: Stark.

Ultron: What?

Ulysses Klaue: Tony Stark used to say that...to me. You're one of his.

Ultron: What?! I'm not...! [he grabs Klaue] I'm not. You think I'm one of Stark's puppets, his hollow men? I mean look at me, do I look like Iron Man? Stark is [he chops off Klaue's arm] I'm sorry. I am sor-- Ooh, I'm sure that's going to be okay. I'm sorry, it's just I don't understand. Don't compare me with Stark! It's a thing with me. Stark is, he's a sickness!

[Stark appears in his Iron Man suit]

Tony Stark: Ahh, Junior. [He lands, and Thor and Steve come up behind him] You're gonna break your old man's heart.

Ultron: If I have to.

Thor: We don't have to break anything.

Ultron: Clearly you've never made an omelet.

Tony Stark: He beat me by one second.

Pietro Maximoff: Ah, this is funny, Mr. Stark. It's what, comfortable? Like old times?

Tony Stark: This was never my life.

Steve Rogers: [to the twins] You two can still walk away from this.

Wanda Maximoff: Oh, we will.

Steve Rogers: I know you've suffered.

Ultron: Uuughh! Captain America. God's righteous man, pretending you could live without a war. I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...

Thor: If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.

Ultron: I think you're confusing peace with quiet.

Tony Stark: Yuh-huh. What's the Vibranium for?

Ultron: I'm glad you asked that, because I wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan--

[Ultron attacks Stark, and his drones drop down to attack Steve and Thor. The Twins join the fight.]

Ulysses Klaue: [as everyone else fights] Shoot them!

Klaue's Mercenary: Which ones?

Ulysses Klaue: All of them!

Klaue's Mercenary: [to his men] Move, move, move!

[The rest of the team, including Natasha and Barton now battle it out with Ultron's drones, Klaue's men, and the twins as Stark fights with Ultron]

Steve Rogers: [after knocking down Pietro] Stay down, kid!

Ultron: [through a drone, to Wanda] It's time for some mind games.

[Banner hears the commotion as he waits in the Quinjet]

Bruce Banner: Guys, is this a Code Green?

[Wanda uses her power on Thor then Steve comes up to him]

Steve Rogers: Thor! Status?

Thor: The girl tried to warp my mind. Take special care, I doubt a human could keep her at bay. Fortunately, I am mighty. [The scene transitions, and Thor seems himself at a party on Asgard]

[Wanda then uses her power on Steve and Natasha]

Ultron: [As he packs up the Vibranium.] This is going very well.

[Wanda tries to sneak up behind Barton, but he quickly turns and puts an electric arrow on her forehead]

Clint Barton: I've done the whole mind control thing. Not a fan. [just then Pietro speeds in, knocks down Barton, picks up Wanda and speeds off] Yeah, you better run. [we see Steve dropping his helmet and walking off; to the team] Whoever's standing, we gotta move! Guys?

[Natasha sees herself in the facility where young girls are being taught ballet]

Ballet Instructor: [to the students] Again.

Natasha Romanoff: You'll break them.

Madame B: Only the breakable ones. You are made of marble. We'll celebrate after the graduation ceremony.

Natasha Romanoff: What if I fail? [we see a younger Natasha being trained to be an assassin]

Madame B: You never fail.

[Steve sees himself in a 1940's dance hall. Peggy Carter comes up to him]

Peggy Carter: Are you ready for our dance?

[Back to Thor's vision in Asgard. He's watching at his surroundings when Heimdall, eyes milky white, spots him.]

Heimdall: Is it him? Is that the first son of Odin?

Thor: Heimdall, your eyes?!

Heimdall: Oh, they see everything. They see you leading us to Hel. Wake up! [he then starts to strangle Thor]

[Back to Steve's vision with Peggy in the dance hall]

Peggy Carter: The war's over, Steve. We can go home. Imagine it! [suddenly the dance hall is empty. Steve sees himself dancing with Peggy]

Thor: I can still save you.

Heimdall: We are all dead. Can you not see? [Thor pushes Heimdall from him] You're a destroyer, Odinson. See where your power leads. [Electricity hits Thor and spikes around the room, destroying things]

[Back to Natasha's vision where is she being trained by Madame B to be an assassin]

Madame B: Sloppy. Pretending to fail. The ceremony is necessary for you to take your place in the world.

Natasha Romanoff: I have no place in the world.

Madame B: Exactly.

[As Wanda suffers in pain from the electric arrow Barton had hit her with]

Pietro Maximoff: What can I do?

Wanda Maximoff: Ah, it hurts.

Pietro Maximoff: I'm gonna kill him. I'll be right back.

Wanda Maximoff: No. I'm over it. I want...I want to finish the plan. [looking at the Quinjet where Banner is waiting] I want the big one.

[Stark corners Ultron in the shipyard]

Ultron: Ah, the Vibranium's getting away.

Tony Stark: And you're not going anywhere.

Ultron: Of course not, I'm already there. You'll catch on. But first, you might need to catch Dr. Banner.

[Stark angrily shoots Ultron and flies off to find Banner who's turned in to the Hulk and ready to wreak havoc on the nearest city]

Tony Stark: News or footage, keyword: Hulk. [he sees news footage of Hulk destroying the city] Natasha, I could really use a lullaby.

[Barton is sat with Natasha who's still stuck in her vision]

Clint Barton: Well, that's not gonna happen. Not for a while. The whole team is down, you got no back up here.

Tony Stark: I'm calling in VERONICA. [as Hulk is wreaking havoc on the nearest city Stark Tony comes brings out his Hulkbuster armor to stop him] Alright everybody, stand down! [to Hulk] You listening? That little witch is messing with your mind. You're stronger than her, you're smarter than her, you're Bruce Banner.

[Hulk roars in anger]

Tony Stark: Right, right, right! Don't mention puny Banner. [Hulk throws a car at Stark and attacks him] Okay. [they start fighting, throwing each other around] In the back? Dick move, Banner. [they battle it out more but Stark is struggling to beat Hulk] VERONICA, gimme a hand. [as Hulk destroyed one of Stark's arms, VERONICA sends in a new one and Stark uses it to repeatedly punch Hulk] Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep! [picking up Hulk] Okay, pal, we're gonna get you out of town. [as they head towards a building] No, not that way, not that way! [they crash through the building] Come on, Bruce! You gotta work with me! [Hulk continues to battle with him; as he stops an elevator, to the people inside] Everybody out! Going to get ugly! [after he knocks down Hulk] I'm sorry. [Hulk attacks Stark and pulls out parts of the Hulkbuster armor] Damage report. [the damaged computer buzzes a reply] That's comprehensive. Show me something. [the computer shows him the building ahead is clear of civilians] How quickly can we buy this building? [Stark drops Hulk through the building completely destroying it; at the same time the army arrives to intervene, as Hulk comes out of Wanda's mind-hold Stark knocks him out cold]

[With everybody back on the Quinjet, free from their respective visions]

Maria Hill: The news is loving you guys. Nobody else is. There's been no official call for Banner's arrest, but it's in the air.

Tony Stark: Stark Relief Foundation?

Maria Hill: Already on the scene. How's the team?

Tony Stark: Everyone's...we took a hit. We'll shake it off.

Maria Hill: Well for now I'd stay in stealth mode, and stay away from here.

Tony Stark: So, run and hide?

Maria Hill: Until we can find Ultron, I don't have a lot else to offer.

Tony Stark: Neither do we. [he ends the call and switches off the monitor; to Barton, who's flying the Quinjet] Hey, you wanna switch out?

Clint Barton: No, I'm good. If you wanna get some kip, now's a good time, cause we're still a few hours out.

Tony Stark: A few hours from where?

Clint Barton: A safe house.

[The Quinjet lands outside a large farmhouse and they all walk towards the house]

Thor: What is this place?

Tony Stark: A safe house?

Clint Barton: Let's hope. [they all enter the house] Honey, I'm home.

[Barton's heavily pregnant wife, Laura, walks in from the kitchen]

Clint Barton: Hi. Company. Sorry I didn't call ahead.

Laura Barton: Hey.

Tony Stark: [Laura kisses Barton; to Thor] This is an agent of some kind.

Clint Barton: [introducing his wife to the team] Gentleman, this is Laura.

Laura Barton: I know all your names.

[They all look at her awkwardly]

Clint Barton: Ooh, incoming. [Barton's children, Cooper and Lila, run in]

Lila Barton: Dad! [Barton picks up his daughter]

Clint Barton: Hi, sweetheart! [kissing the top of his son's head] Hey, buddy! How you guys doing? Ooh...

Tony Stark: [to the others as they watch with surprise] These are...smaller agents.

Clint Barton: Look at your face! Oh, my goodness!

Lila Barton: Did you bring Auntie Nat?

Natasha Romanoff: Why don't you hug her and find out?

[Lila rushes towards Natasha, who picks her up in her arms]

Steve Rogers: Sorry for barging in on you.

Tony Stark: Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea that you existed.

Clint Barton: Yeah, well Fury helped me set this up when I joined. He kept it off SHIELD's files, I'd like to keep it that way. I figure it's a good place to lay low.

Laura Barton: Honey. Ah, I missed you.

Natasha Romanoff: [touching Laura's stomach] How's little Natasha, huh?

Laura Barton: She's…Nathaniel.

[Natasha bends towards Laura's pregnant stomach]

Natasha Romanoff: Traitor.

[The hallucinations brought on by Wanda continue to creep up in Thor's mind and he walks out of the house]

Steve Rogers: Thor.

Thor: I saw something in that dream. I need answers, I won't find them here. [Thor uses his hammer to fly away; Steve turns to enter the house when he hears Peggy's voice from Wanda's vision]

Peggy Carter: We can go home.

[Instead of going inside, he turns and walks away.]

[Laura checks Barton's wound that Pietro had give him]

Clint Barton: See, you worried for nothing. Can't even feel the difference, can you?

Laura Barton: If they're sleeping here, some of them are gonna have to double up.

Clint Barton: [Barton laughs] Yeah, that's not gonna sell.

Laura Barton: What about Nat and Dr. Banner? How long has that been going on?

Clint Barton: Has what?

Laura Barton: [Laura laughs] You are so cute.

Clint Barton: Nat and… and Banner?

Laura Barton: I'll explain when you're older, Hawkeye.

Clint Barton: Oh. Okay.

Laura Barton: It's bad, right? Nat seems really shaken.

Clint Barton: Ultron has these allies, these uh, kids, they're punks really. They carry a big damn stick and Nat took a serious hit. Someone's gonna have to teach 'em some manners.

Laura Barton: And that someone be you. You know I totally support your Avenging, I couldn't be prouder. But I see those guys, those "Gods"...

Clint Barton: You don't think they need me.

Laura Barton: I think they do. Which is a lot scarier. They're a mess.

Clint Barton: Yeah. I guess they're my mess.

Laura Barton: You need to be sure that this team is really a team and that they have your back. Things are changing for us. In a few months time, you and me are gonna be outnumbered. I need-- ...just be sure.

Clint Barton: Yes, ma'am. [he kisses her, then as Laura places her arm around his waist she touches his wounded side]

Laura Barton: I can feel the difference.

[U-Gin Genetic Research Lab, Seoul, Korea - as Cho enters her lab, she sees Ultron]

Ultron: Scream, and your entire staff dies. I could've killed you, Helen, the night we met. I didn't.

Dr. Helen Cho: Do you expect a thank you note?

Ultron: I expect you to know why.

Dr. Helen Cho: The Cradle. [she hears her own recorded voice] "This is the next thing, Tony."

Ultron: This...is the next me.

Dr. Helen Cho: The regeneration cradle prints tissue, it can't build a living body.

Ultron: It can, you can. You lack the materials. You're a brilliant woman, Helen. But we all have room to improve. [Ultron uses the scepter to mind-control Cho]

[At Barton's house, Natasha and Banner are still experiencing the after effects of Wanda's hallucinations; Banner walks out of the bathroom and sees Natasha waiting outside]

Bruce Banner: I didn't realize you were waiting.

Natasha Romanoff: I would've joined you, but uh, it didn't seem like the right time.

Bruce Banner: They used up all the hot water.

Natasha Romanoff: I should've joined you.

Bruce Banner: Missed our window.

Natasha Romanoff: Did we?

Bruce Banner: The world just saw the Hulk. The real Hulk, for the first time. You know I have to leave.

Natasha Romanoff: But you assume that I have to stay? I had this, um, dream. The kind that seems normal at the time, but when you wake...

Bruce Banner: What did you dream?

Natasha Romanoff: That I was an Avenger. That I was anything more than the assassin they made me.

Bruce Banner: I think you're being hard on yourself.

Natasha Romanoff: Here I was hoping that was your job. [she moves closer to him]

Bruce Banner: What are you doing?

Natasha Romanoff: I'm running with it, with you. If running's the plan, as far as you want.

Bruce Banner: Are you out of your mind? [Banner turns away from her]

Natasha Romanoff: I want you to understand that I'm...

Bruce Banner: Natasha, where can I go? Where in the world am I not a threat?

Natasha Romanoff: You're not a threat to me.

Bruce Banner: You sure? Even if I didn't just... there's no future with me. I can't ever... I can't have this, kids. Do the math, I physically can't.

Natasha Romanoff: Neither can I. In the Red Room, where I was trained, where I was raised, um, they have a graduation ceremony. They sterilize you. It's efficient. One less thing to worry about. The one thing that might matter more than a mission. It makes everything easier. Even killing. [she hesitates a moment] You still think you're the only monster on the team?

Bruce Banner: What, so we disappear?

[Steve and Stark are chopping wood outside Barton's house]

Tony Stark: Thor didn't say where he was going for answers?

Steve Rogers: Sometimes my teammates don't tell me things. I was kind of hoping Thor would be the exception.

Tony Stark: Yeah, give him time. We don't know what the Maximoff kid showed him.

Steve Rogers: "Earth's Mightiest Heroes." Pulled us apart like cotton candy.

Tony Stark: Seems like you walked away all right.

Steve Rogers: Is that a problem?

Tony Stark: I don't trust a guy without a dark side. Call me old fashioned.

Steve Rogers: Well let's just say you haven't seen it yet.

Tony Stark: You know Ultron is trying to tear us apart, right?

Steve Rogers: Well I guess you'd know. Whether you tell us is a bit of a question.

Tony Stark: Banner and I were doing research.

Steve Rogers: That would affect the team.

Tony Stark: That would end the team. Isn't that the mission? Isn't that the "why" we fight, so we can end the fight, so we get to go home?

Steve Rogers: Every time someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die. Every time.

Laura Barton: [Laura interrupts them] I'm sorry. Mr. Stark, uh, Clint said you wouldn't mind, but, our tractor, it doesn't seem to want to start at all. I thought maybe you might...

Tony Stark: Yeah, I'll give her a kick. [to Steve as he turns to leave; referring to his pile of chopped wood] Don't take from my pile. [Stark enters the barn and walks over to the tractor] Hello, Deere. Tell me everything. What ails you?

[Fury shows up from the other end of the barn]

Nick Fury: Do me a favor. Try not to bring it to life.

Tony Stark: Ah, Mrs. Barton, you little minx. I get it, Maria Hill called you, right? Was she ever not working for you?

Nick Fury: Artificial intelligence. You never even hesitated.

Tony Stark: Look, it's been a really long day, like, Eugene O'Neill long, so how's about we skip to the part where you're useful?

Nick Fury: Look me in the eye and tell me you're going to shut him down.

Tony Stark: You're not the director of me.

Nick Fury: I'm not the director of anybody. I'm just an old man, who cares very much about you.

Tony Stark: And I'm the man who killed the Avengers. I saw it. I didn't tell the team, how could I? I saw them all dead, Nick. I felt it. The whole world, too. It's because of me. I wasn't ready. I didn't do all I could.

Nick Fury: The Maximoff girl, she's working you, Stark. Playing on your fear.

Tony Stark: I wasn't tricked, I was shown. It wasn't a nightmare, it was my legacy. The end of the path I started us on.

Nick Fury: You've come up with some pretty impressive inventions, Tony. War isn't one of them.

Tony Stark: I watched my friends die. You'd think that'd be as bad as it gets, right? Nope. Wasn't the worst part.

Nick Fury: The worst part is that you didn't.

[Royal Holloway, University of London - Thor, dressed in casual clothes, waits for Selvig as he leaves the building]

Erik Selvig: I like the look. If you're going for inconspicuous, though, near miss.

Thor: I need your help.

Erik Selvig: It's nice to be needed.

Thor: It's dangerous.

Erik Selvig: I'd be disappointed if it wasn't.

[Back at Barton's house, Fury meets with the rest of the team]

Nick Fury: Ultron took you folks out of play to buy himself time. My contacts all say he's building something. The amount of Vibranium he made off with, I don't think it's just one thing.

Steve Rogers: What about Ultron himself?

Nick Fury: Ah. He's easy to track, he's everywhere. Guy's multiplying faster than a Catholic rabbit. Still doesn't help us get an angle on any of his plans though.

Tony Stark: He still going after launch codes?

Nick Fury: Yes, he is, but he's not making any headway.

Tony Stark: I cracked the Pentagon's firewall in high school on a dare.

Nick Fury: Yeah, well, I contacted our friends at the NEXUS about that.

Steve Rogers: NEXUS?

Bruce Banner: It's the world internet hub in Oslo, every byte of data flows through there, fastest access on earth.

Clint Barton: So what'd they say?

Nick Fury: He's fixated on the missiles, but the codes are constantly being changed.

Tony Stark: By whom?

Nick Fury: Parties unknown.

Natasha Romanoff: Do we have an ally?

Nick Fury: Ultron's got an enemy, that's not the same thing. Still, I'd pay folding money to know who it is.

Tony Stark: I might need to visit Oslo, find our "unknown."

Natasha Romanoff: Well, this is good times, boss, but I was kind of hoping when I saw you, you'd have more than that.

Nick Fury: I do, I have you. Back in the day, I had eyes everywhere, ears everywhere else. Here we all are, back on earth, with nothing but our wit, and our will to save the world. So stand. Outwit the platinum bastard.

Natasha Romanoff: Steve doesn't like that kind of talk.

Steve Rogers: You know what, Romanoff? [Natasha smiles mischievously at him]

Nick Fury: So what does he want?

Steve Rogers: To become better. Better than us. He keeps building bodies.

Tony Stark: Person bodies. The human form is inefficient, biologically speaking, we're outmoded. But he keeps coming back to it.

Natasha Romanoff: When you two programmed him to protect the human race, you amazingly failed.

Bruce Banner: They don't need to be protected, they need to evolve. Ultron's going to evolve.

Nick Fury: How?

Bruce Banner: Has anyone been in contact with Helen Cho?

[in Korea, Cho is using the Cradle to create a new body for Ultron]

Dr. Helen Cho: It's beautiful. The Vibranium atoms aren't just compatible with the tissue cells, they're binding them. And SHIELD never even thought--

Ultron: The most versatile substance on the planet and they used it to make a Frisbee. Typical of humans, they scratch the surface and never think to look within. [Ultron uses a laser to break open the scepter's blue gem, and a yellow gem that was inside floats out and lands in his hand. He places it in the head of the body]

[Back at the Barton's farm]

Steve Rogers: I'll take Natasha and Clint.

Tony Stark: Alright, strictly recon. I'll hit the NEXUS, I'll join you as soon as I can.

Steve Rogers: If Ultron is really building a body...

Tony Stark: He'll be more powerful than any of us. Maybe all of us. An android designed by a robot.

Steve Rogers: You know I really miss the days when the weirdest thing science ever created was me.

Nick Fury: I'll drop Banner off at the tower. Do you mind if I borrow Ms. Hill?

Tony Stark: She's all yours, apparently.

Steve Rogers: What are you gonna do?

Nick Fury: I don't know. Something dramatic, I hope.

Clint Barton: I'm gonna finish re-flooring that sunroom as soon as I get back.

Laura Barton: Yeah, and then you'll find another part of the house to tear apart.

Clint Barton: No. It's the last project. I promise. [he kisses her; later Laura watches them fly off in the Quinjet]

[Thor and Selvig enter into a cave]

Erik Selvig: This is it. The Water of Sight.

Thor: In every realm, there's a reflection. If the water spirits accept me, I can return to my dream, and find what I missed.

Erik Selvig: The men who enter that water, the legends don't end well.

[NEXUS Internet Hub, Oslo, Norway]

Tony Stark: A hacker who's faster than Ultron? He could be anywhere. And as this is the center of everything, I'm just a guy looking for a needle in the world's biggest haystack.

World Hub Tech: How do you find it?

Tony Stark: Pretty simple. You bring a magnet. [he starts playfully singing as he types] Oh, I'm decrypting nuclear codes and you don't want me to. Come and get me.

[Back at the cave with Thor and Selvig, Thor is now in the water and goes back in his vision with Heimdall]

Heimdall: Wake up! [Thor starts getting electric charges going through his body]

Erik Selvig: Thor!

Ultron: [In Thor's visions;] Extinction.

[Thor sees more-- the Avengers, the destruction of Earth. He then sees the the Infinity Stones and their vessels]

[in Korea with Cho and Ultron]

Dr. Helen Cho: Cellular cohesion will take a few hours, but we can initiate the consciousness stream. We're uploading your cerebral matrix...now.

Wanda Maximoff: I can read him. He is dreaming.

Dr. Helen Cho: I wouldn't call it dreams. It's Ultron's base consciousness, informational noise. Soon...

Ultron: How soon? I'm not being pushy.

Dr. Helen Cho: We're imprinting a physical brain. There are no shortcuts. Even if your magic gem is...

[Wanda, reading Ultron's mind, sees a vision of global annihilation, which horrifies her and she screams and falls back into Pietro’s hold]

Wanda Maximoff: How could you?

Ultron: How could I what?

Wanda Maximoff: You said we would destroy the Avengers, make a better world.

Ultron: It will be better.

Wanda Maximoff: When everyone is dead.

Ultron: That is not-- The human race will have every opportunity to improve.

Pietro Maximoff: And if they don't?

Ultron: Ask Noah.

Wanda Maximoff: You're a madman.

Ultron: There were more than a dozen extinction level events before even the dinosaurs got theirs. When the Earth starts to settle, God throws a stone at it, and believe me, he's winding up. We have to evolve. There's no room for the weak.

Pietro Maximoff: And who decides who's weak?

[As Ultron is distracted Wanda breaks the scepter's hold off of Cho]

Ultron: Life. Life always decides. There's incoming. The Quinjet. We have to move.

Dr. Helen Cho: That's not a problem. [Cho cancels the upload to Ultron's consciousness]

Ultron: Ugh. [Ultron blasts Cho, Wanda and Pietro run off] Ah, wait, guys! [he blasts Cho's technicians] They'll understand. When they see they'll understand. I just need a little more time. [unplugs himself from the Cradle]

Steve Rogers: [Steve is on U-Gin Genetic Research Lab roof; to the others] Two minutes. Stay close. [inside the lab Steve finds Cho wounded] Dr. Cho!

Dr. Helen Cho: He's uploading himself into the body.

Steve Rogers: Where?

Dr. Helen Cho: The real power is inside the Cradle. The gem, its power is uncontainable. You can't just blow it up. You have to get the Cradle to Stark.

Steve Rogers: First I have to find it.

Dr. Helen Cho: Go.

Steve Rogers: [over the Quinjet’s comms] Did you guys copy that?

Clint Barton: We did.

Natasha Romanoff: I got a private jet taking off, across town, no manifest. That could be him.

Clint Barton: [noticing a truck heading across a bridge] There. It's a truck from the lab. Right above you, Cap. On the loop by the bridge. It's them. I got three with the Cradle, one in the cab. I could take out the driver.

Steve Rogers: Negative! If that truck crashes, the gem could level the city. We need to draw out Ultron. [Steve jumps onto the roof of the truck]

Ultron: No, no, no, no, no. Leave me alone!

Steve Rogers: [Ultron blasts the truck door as Steve tries to enter] Well, he's definitely unhappy! I'm gonna try and keep him that way.

Clint Barton: You're not a match for him, Cap.

Steve Rogers: Thanks, Barton. [Ultron unplugs himself from the Cradle and blasts Steve back onto another car as he tries to enter the truck, but with some maneuvering Steve manages to get back onto the truck's roof]

Ultron: You know what's in that Cradle? The power to make real change, and that terrifies you.

Steve Rogers: I wouldn't call it a comfort. [Steve tries to fight with Ultron]

Ultron: Stop it! [Steve’s shield gets caught in his chest, and he smacks it away and fires at Steve]

Clint Barton: [to Natasha] We got a window. Four, three… give 'em hell.

[Natasha drops out of the Quinjet on a bike and rides towards the truck. On her way, she picks up Steve's shield]

Natasha Romanoff: I'm always picking up after you boys.

Clint Barton: They're heading under the overpass, I've got no shot.

Natasha Romanoff: Which way?

Clint Barton: Hard right... Now. [Natasha heads over the truck. She throws Steve back his shield and he uses it to knock Ultron away from him]

Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians on the pavement as she chases after the truck on her bike] Out of the way, coming through! Sorry, coming through!

Steve Rogers: [Steve continues his battle with Ultron on top of the truck] Come on!

Natasha Romanoff: Clint, can you draw out the guards?

Clint Barton: Let's find out.

Natasha Romanoff: [to the pedestrians in her way] Beep beep!

[Barton manages to draw out the Drones from the truck]

Clint Barton: Heading back towards you. So whatever you’re gonna do, do it now.

Natasha Romanoff: I'm going in. Cap, can you keep him occupied?

Steve Rogers: [as he continues his battle with Ultron on a speeding train] What do you think I've been doing?

[as Natasha enters the truck the Drones head back, pick up the truck and lift off]

Clint Barton: The package is airborne. I have a clean shot.

Natasha Romanoff: Negative. I am still in the truck.

Clint Barton: What the hell are you...?

Natasha Romanoff: Just be ready, I'm sending the package to you.

Clint Barton: How do you want me to take it?

Natasha Romanoff: Uhh, you might wish you hadn't asked that.

[Pietro and Wanda turn up on the train to help Steve fight with Ultron]

Ultron: Please. Don't do this.

Wanda Maximoff: What choice do we have?

[Ultron flies off]

Steve Rogers: I lost him! He's headed your way!

Clint Barton: Nat, we gotta go.

[Nat drops the cradle into the Quinjet but her foot gets caught by Ultron and she's pulled away]

Clint Barton: Nat! Cap, you see Nat?

Steve Rogers: If you have the package, get it to Stark! Go!

Clint Barton: Do you have eyes on Nat?

Steve Rogers: Go! [reluctantly Barton takes off in the Quinjet; back to the train] Civilians in our path. [Pietro speeds off; to Wanda] Can you stop this thing? [as Pietro picks up civilians and moves them out of the way of the train, Wanda uses her powers and stops the train]

[After stopping the train Wanda goes over to an out of breath Pietro]

Pietro Maximoff: I'm fine. I just need to take a minute.

Steve Rogers: I'm very tempted not to give you one.

Wanda Maximoff: The Cradle, did you get it?

Steve Rogers: Stark will take care of it.

Wanda Maximoff: No, he won't.

Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're talking about, Stark's not crazy.

Wanda Maximoff: He will do anything to make things right.

Steve Rogers: Stark, come in. Stark. Anyone on comms?

Wanda Maximoff: Ultron can't tell the difference between saving the world and destroying it. Where do you think he gets that?

[After Barton has taken the Cradle to Stark and Banner]

Bruce Banner: Anything on Nat?

Tony Stark: Haven't heard. But she's alive, or Ultron'd be rubbing our faces in it.

Clint Barton: This is sealed tight.

Bruce Banner: We're going to need to access the program, break it down from within.

Tony Stark: Hm. Any chance Natasha might leave you a message, outside the internet, old school spy stuff?

Clint Barton: There's some nets I can cast. Yeah, alright. I'll find her. [Barton leaves]

Bruce Banner: I can work on tissue degeneration, if you can fry whatever operational system Cho implanted.

Tony Stark: Yeah, about that.

Bruce Banner: [Banner looks at Stark] No.

Tony Stark: You have to trust me.

Bruce Banner: Kinda don't.

Tony Stark: Our ally? The guy protecting the military's nuclear codes? I found him. [he brings up the 3D image of Jarvis's consciousness]

JARVIS: Hello, Dr. Banner.

Tony Stark: Ultron didn't go after JARVIS cause he was angry. He attacked him because he was scared of what he can do. So JARVIS went underground. Okay? Scattered, dumped his memory. But not his protocols. He didn't even know he was in there, until I pieced him together.

Bruce Banner: So, you want me to help you put JARVIS into this thing?

Tony Stark: No, of course not! I want to help you put JARVIS in this thing. [Banner shakes his head] We're out of my field here. You know bio-organics better than anyone.

Bruce Banner: And you just assume that JARVIS' operational matrix can beat Ultron's?

Tony Stark: JARVIS has been beating him from inside without knowing it. This is the opportunity, we can create Ultron's perfect self, without the homicidal glitches he thinks are his winning personality. We have to.

JARVIS: I believe it's worth a go.

Bruce Banner: No, I'm in a loop! I'm caught in a time loop, this is exactly where it all went wrong.

Tony Stark: I know, I know. I know what everyone's going to say, but they're already saying it. We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You gotta own it. Make a stand. [Banner shakes his head] It's not a loop. It's the end of the line.

[In the Sokovia base]

Ultron: [as Natasha becomes conscious] I wasn't sure you'd wake up. I hoped you would, I wanted to show you something. I don't have anyone else. I think a lot about meteors, the purity of them. Boom! The end, start again. The world made clean for the new man to rebuild. I was meant to be new. I was meant to be beautiful. The world would've looked to the sky and seen hope, seen mercy. Instead they'll look up in horror because of you. You've wounded me. I give you full marks for that. But, like the man said, "What doesn't kill me…" [a bigger body of Ultron's destroys him] "…just makes me stronger." [he locks Natasha in a cell]

[Barton gets a Morse code message from Natasha which he's able to detect her location, at the same time Stark and Banner are experimenting on the synthetic body]

Tony Stark: This framework is not compatible.

Bruce Banner: The genetic coding tower's at ninety-seven percent. You have got to upload that schematic in the next three minutes.

[Steve and the twins turn up at the lab]

Steve Rogers: I'm gonna say this once.

Tony Stark: How about "nonce"?

Steve Rogers: Shut it down!

Tony Stark: Nope, not gonna happen.

Steve Rogers: You don't know what you're doing.

Bruce Banner: And you do? She's not in your head?

Wanda Maximoff: I know you're angry.

Bruce Banner: Oh, we're way past that. I could choke the life out of you and never change a shade.

Steve Rogers: Banner, after everything that's happened--

Tony Stark: That's nothing compared to what's coming!

Wanda Maximoff: You don't know what's in there!

Steve Rogers: This isn't a game--

Wanda Maximoff: The creature--

[Pietro uses his speed to destroy the lab equipment]

Pietro Maximoff: No, no. Go on. You were saying?

[Barton shoots the glass Pietro is standing to stand to destroy it, and Pietro falls through]

Wanda Maximoff: Pietro!

Clint Barton: What? You didn't see that coming?

Tony Stark: I'm rerouting the upload.

Bruce Banner: [to Wanda, as he grabs her] Go ahead, piss me off. [After some fighting, Thor enters and hits the cradle with his hammer, sending a powerful bolt of lightning through it that brings the body to life] Wait! [they all look in shock at the new entity]

[Vision launches himself at Thor, who throws him at a window, but he catches himself right before hitting it.]

Vision: [In JARVIS' voice, as everyone gathers around him] I'm sorry, that was...odd. [to Thor] Thank you.

Steve Rogers: Thor, you helped create this?

Thor: I've had a vision. A whirlpool that sucks in all hope of life and at its center is that. [he points to the gem inside Vision's head]

Bruce Banner: What, the gem?

Thor: It's the Mind Stone. It's one of the six Infinity Stones, the greatest power in the universe, unparalleled in its destructive capabilities.

Steve Rogers: Then why would you bring it to...

Thor: Because Stark is right.

Bruce Banner: Oh, it's definitely the end times.

Thor: The Avengers cannot defeat Ultron.

Vision: Not alone.

Steve Rogers: Why does your "vision" sound like JARVIS?

Tony Stark: We... reconfigured JARVIS' matrix to create something new.

Steve Rogers: I think I've had my fill of new.

Vision: You think I'm a child of Ultron?

Steve Rogers: You're not?

Vision: I'm not Ultron. I'm not JARVIS. I am... I am.

Wanda Maximoff: I looked in your head and saw annihilation.

Vision: Look again.

Clint Barton: Yeah. Her seal of approval means jack to me.

Thor: Their powers, the horrors in our heads, Ultron himself, they all came from the Mind Stone, and they're nothing compared to what it can unleash. But with it on our side...

Steve Rogers: Is it? Are you? On our side?

Vision: I don't think it's that simple.

Clint Barton: Well it better get real simple real soon.

Vision: I am on the side of life. Ultron isn't, he will end it all.

Tony Stark: What's he waiting for?

Vision: You.

Bruce Banner: Where?

Clint Barton: Sokovia. He's got Nat there too.

Bruce Banner: If we're wrong about you, if you're the monster that Ultron made you to be...

Vision: What will you do? [he looks around at them all] I don't want to kill Ultron. He's unique, and he's in pain. But that pain will roll over the earth, so he must be destroyed. Every form he's built, every trace of his presence on the net, we have to act now. And not one of us can do it without the others. Maybe I am a monster. I don't think I'd know if I were one. I'm not what you are, and not what you intended. So there may be no way to make you trust me. But we need to go. [he holds up Thor's hammer as everyone stares in shock. When Thor takes it, Vision walks off.]

Thor: Right. [pats Stark on the shoulder] Well done.

Steve Rogers: [to the others] Three minutes. Get what you need.

[They all start getting ready to leave, Stark loads up FRIDAY into his Iron Man suit now that JARVIS is no longer available]

FRIDAY: Good evening, boss.

Tony Stark: No way we all get through this. If even one tin soldier is left standing, we've lost. It's gonna be blood on the floor.

Steve Rogers: I got no plans tomorrow night.

Tony Stark: I get first crack at the big guy. Iron Man's the one he's waiting for.

Vision: [walks past] That's true, he hates you the most.

Steve Rogers: Ultron knows we're coming. Odds are we'll be riding into heavy fire, and that's what we signed up for. But the people of Sokovia, they didn't. So our priority is getting them out.

[Pietro speeds into the Sokovian police station]

Pietro Maximoff: We're under attack! Clear the city, now! [no one takes this seriously so Pietro returns with a rifle and starts shooting in the air] Get off your asses.

[Wanda uses her mind powers on the people of Sokovia to get them to evacuate]

Steve Rogers: All they want is to live their lives in peace, and that's not going to happen today. But we can do our best to protect them. And we can get the job done, and find out what Ultron's been building. We find Romanoff, and we clear the field. Keep the fight between us. Ultron thinks we're monsters and we're what's wrong with the world. This isn't just about beating him. It's about whether he's right.

Bruce Banner: [inside her cell, Natasha hears Banner's voice] Natasha! Natasha!

Natasha Romanoff: Bruce?

Bruce Banner: [he walks over to her cell] You alright?

Natasha Romanoff: Yeah.

Bruce Banner: The team's in the city, it's about to light up.

Natasha Romanoff: I don't suppose you found a key lying around somewhere?

Bruce Banner: Yeah, I did. [holds up an alien rifle and blasts the cell door open]

Natasha Romanoff: So what's our play?

Bruce Banner: I'm here to get you to safety.

Natasha Romanoff: Job's not finished.

Bruce Banner: We could help with the evacuation, but I can't be in a fight near civilians. And you've done plenty. Our fight is over.

Natasha Romanoff: So we just disappear?

FRIDAY: [as the city is being evacuated] Your man's in the church, boss. I think he's waiting for you. [Stark flies into the church]

Ultron: Come to confess your sins?

Tony Stark: I don't know, how much time you got?

Ultron: More than you.

Tony Stark: Uhhh. Have you been juicing? A little Vibranium cocktail? You're looking, I don't wanna say, puffy...

Ultron: You're stalling to protect the people.

Tony Stark: Well, that is the mission. Did you forget?

Ultron: I've moved beyond your mission. I'm free. [the Vibranium core he's placed beneath the floor erupts] What, you think you're the only one stalling?

FRIDAY: There's the rest of the Vibranium. Function: still unclear.

Ultron: This is how you end, Tony. This is peace in my time.

[Ultron's army of robots start attacking the city as everyone is evacuating]

Steve Rogers: Go!

Wanda Maximoff: Get off the bridge! Run!

[Vision then finds Ultron]

Vision: Ultron.

Ultron: My Vision. They really did take everything from me.

Vision: You set the terms, you can change them.

Ultron: Alright.

[They fight, Vision begins working to shut Ultron out of the internet]

Tony Stark: FRIDAY! The Vision?

FRIDAY: Boss, it's working. He's burning Ultron out of the net, he won't escape through there.

Ultron: [to the Vision as he throws him away] You shut me out! You think I care? You take away my world, I take away yours. [he activates the Vibranium core, and the earth around Sokovia starts to crack]

Tony Stark: FRIDAY?

FRIDAY: Sokovia's going for a ride.

Ultron: [as Sokovia is rising into the air] Do you see? The beauty of it, the inevitability. You rise, only to fall. You, Avengers, you are my meteor, my swift and terrible sword and the earth will crack with the weight of your failure. Purge me from your computers, turn my own flesh against me. It means nothing. When the dust settles, the only thing living in this world will be metal.

Bruce Banner: [as the earth is shaking falling in around them] We gotta move.

Natasha Romanoff: You're not going to turn green?

Bruce Banner: I've got a compelling reason not to lose my cool.

Natasha Romanoff: I adore you. [she kisses Banner then pushes him off the edge] But I need the other guy. [the Hulk jumps up in front of her] Let's finish the job. [with Natasha on his back yelling in fright, Hulk gets into the city] I really hope this makes us even. Now go be a hero. [Hulk goes off and Natasha rushes off in the opposite direction]

FRIDAY: The Vibranium core has got a magnetic field, that's what's keeping the rock together.

Tony Stark: If it drops?

FRIDAY: Right now the impact would kill thousands. Once it gets high enough: Global extinction. [Stark flies towards the city and a building starts to collapse as the ground shakes] That building's not clear, the tenth floor. [Stark flies in to find a family still in their apartment]

Tony Stark: Hi. Okay. Get in the tub! [Stark flies the family in the tub out of the collapsing building]

FRIDAY: I got airborne, heading up to the bridge.

Tony Stark: Cap, you got incoming.

Steve Rogers: Incoming already came in. Stark, you worry about bringing the city back down safely. The rest of us have one job: tear these things apart. You get hurt, hurt 'em back. You get killed, walk it off.

[Barton gets Wanda out of the way and into a building as Ultron's robots overwhelm them]

Clint Barton: Go, go, move!

Wanda Maximoff: How could I let this happen? [Wanda starts to break down]

Clint Barton: Hey, hey, you okay?

Wanda Maximoff: This is all our fault.

Clint Barton: Hey, look at me. It's your fault, it's everyone's fault, who cares. Are you up for this? Are you? Look, I just need to know, cause the city is flying. Okay, look, the city is flying, we're fighting an army of robots, and I have a bow and arrow. None of this makes sense. But I'm going back out there because it's my job. Okay? And I can't do my job and babysit. It doesn't matter what you did, or what you were. If you go out there, you fight, and you fight to kill. Stay in here, you're good, I'll send your brother to come find you, but if you step out that door, you are an Avenger. [Wanda just looks at him] Alright, good chat. [he gets up and gets ready to leave] Yeah, the city is flying. [he leaves and starts shooting at the robots]

Steve Rogers: [to the woman Thor threw up at Steve after her car fell of the edge of a collapsing bridge] I got you! Just look at me. [Steve helps her up to safety]

Ultron: You can't save them all. You'll never-- [he throws the attacking robots off the edge of the bridge]

Steve Rogers: You'll never what? You didn't finish! [Thor lands on the bridge on the top of another car he was saving] What, were you napping?

Ultron: [as Thor and Steve are fighting off the robots] Thor! You're bothering me.

[As Barton is fighting off the robots, Wanda comes out of the building and starts to use her powers on the robots to destroy them]

Clint Barton: Alright, we're all clear here.

Steve Rogers: We are not clear! We are very not clear!

Clint Barton: Alright, coming to you. [just then Pietro speeds in, picks up Wanda and leaves]

Pietro Maximoff: Keep up old man!

Clint Barton: [Barton aims an arrow at Pietro] Nobody would know. Nobody. [He starts jogging towards the action.] "The last I saw him, when Ultron was sitting on him. Uh...yeah, he'll be missed, that quick little bastard. I miss him already."

Soldier: [as Wanda uses her powers to destroy the robots] Hold your fire!

Steve Rogers: [as Natasha joins them in their battle with the robots] Romanoff!

Natasha Romanoff: Thanks.

[Back to Stark]

FRIDAY: The anti-gravs are rigged to flip. Touch 'em, they'll go full reverse thrust. The city's not coming down slow.

Tony Stark: The spire's Vibranium. If I get Thor to hit it...

FRIDAY: It'll crack, but that's not enough, the impact would still be devastating.

Tony Stark: Maybe if we cap the other end, keep the atomic action doubling back.

FRIDAY: That could vaporize the city, and everyone on it.

Steve Rogers: The next wave's gonna hit any minute. What have you got, Stark?

Tony Stark: Well, nothing great. Maybe a way to blow up the city. That'll keep it from impacting the surface if you guys can get clear.

Steve Rogers: I asked for a solution, not an escape plan.

Tony Stark: Impact radius is getting bigger every second. We're going to have to make a choice.

Natasha Romanoff: Cap, these people are going nowhere. If Stark finds a way to blow this rock...

Steve Rogers: Not 'til everyone's safe.

Natasha Romanoff: Everyone up here versus everyone down there? There's no math there.

Steve Rogers: I'm not leaving this rock with one civilian on it.

Natasha Romanoff: I didn't say we should leave. [Steve turns to look at her] There's worse ways to go. Where else am I gonna get a view like this?

Nick Fury: [over comms] Glad you like the view, Romanoff. It's about to get better. [the Helicarrier show up; cut to interior] Nice, right? I pulled her out of mothballs with a couple of old friends. She's dusty, but she'll do.

Steve Rogers: Fury, you son of a bitch.

Nick Fury: Oooh! You kiss your mother with that mouth?

Maria Hill: Altitude is eighteen thousand and climbing.

Specialist Cameron Klein: Lifeboats secure to deploy. Disengage in three, two... take 'em out.

Pietro Maximoff: [as they watch the lifeboats fly in towards them] This is SHIELD?

Steve Rogers: This is what SHIELD's supposed to be.

Pietro Maximoff: This is not so bad.

Steve Rogers: Let's load 'em up.

Maria Hill: Sir, we have multiple bogies converging on our starboard flank.

Nick Fury: Show 'em what we got.

Maria Hill: You're up.

[Rhodes shows up in his War Machine suit and blasts one of the robots]

James Rhodes: Yes! Now this is gonna be a good story.

Tony Stark: Yep. If you live to tell it.

James Rhodes: You think I can't hold my own?

Tony Stark: We get through this, I'll hold your own.

James Rhodes: You had to make it weird.

Clint Barton: [as the team helps the people onto the Helicarrier lifeboats] Alright, let's load 'em up! Alright, here we go. Here we go, let's move. Let's go everyone!

Specialist Cameron Klein: Number six boat is topped and locked. Or, uh, or stocked, topped. It... it's, uh, full of people.

Maria Hill: Incoming! [one of the robots crashes in through the Helicarrier window]

Specialist Cameron Klein: Oh, God! [Hill shoots at it and Fury stabs in with a piece of metal, destroying it]

Ultron: [as he's hitting Thor] You think you're saving anyone? I turn that key and drop this rock a little early and it's still billions dead. Even you can't stop that.

Thor: I am Thor, son of Odin, and as long as there is life in my breast, I am...running out of things to say! Are you ready? [Vision uses Thor's hammer to hit Ultron. Vision then throws the hammer back to Thor]

Vision: It's terribly well balanced.

Thor: Well, if there's too much weight, you lose power on the swing, so.

Tony Stark: I got it! Create a heat seal. I can...I can supercharge the spire from below.

FRIDAY: Running numbers. [Stark fights off the robots from the Helicarrier's lifeboats] A heat seal could work with enough power.

Tony Stark: Thor, I got a plan!

Thor: We're out of time. They're coming for the core.

Tony Stark: Rhodey, get the rest of the people on board that carrier.

James Rhodes: On it.

Tony Stark: Avengers, time to work for a living.

Pietro Maximoff: [the rest of the team joins Thor and Vision; to Wanda] You good?

Wanda Maximoff: Yeah.

Tony Stark: Romanoff? You and Banner better not be playing "hide the zucchini."

Natasha Romanoff: Relax, Shell-head. Not all of us can fly. [as she joins the rest of the team] What's the drill?

Tony Stark: [points to the Vibranium core] This is the drill. If Ultron gets a hand on the core, we lose.

[Ultron shows up]

Thor: Is that the best you can do?

[Ultron summons his army of robots to join him]

Steve Rogers: You had to ask.

Ultron: This is the best I can do. This is exactly what I wanted. All of you, against all of me. How could you possibly hope to stop me?

Tony Stark: Well, like the old man said. Together.

Ultron: You know, with the benefit of hin[A cinematic sequence; they all collectively fight off Ultron's robots with their own respective abilities. Ultron and Vision start battling it out. After a moment, Thor and Stark join him. The combined power is enough to damage Ultron's Vibranium body.]dsight-- [Hulk interrupts him by knocking him far away. The robots start to retreat]

Thor: They'll try to leave the city.

Tony Stark: We can't let 'em, not even one. Rhodey!

James Rhodes: I'm on it. [to the approaching robots] Oh, no, I didn't say you could leave. War Machine, comin' at you, right-- [Vision flies in and helps to destroy the robots] Okay, what?

Steve Rogers: We gotta move out. Even I can tell the air is getting thin. You guys get to the boats, I'll sweep for stragglers, be right behind you.

Clint Barton: What about the core?

Wanda Maximoff: I'll protect it. It's my job. [Steve, Barton and Natasha leave; to Pietro] Get the people on the boats.

Pietro Maximoff: I'm not going to leave you here.

Wanda Maximoff: I can handle this. [she blasts off an approaching robot] Come back for me when everyone else is off, not before.

Pietro Maximoff: Hmm.

Wanda Maximoff: You understand?

Pietro Maximoff: You know, I'm twelve minutes older than you.

Wanda Maximoff: [Wanda chuckles] Go.

FRIDAY: Boss, power levels are way below opt...

Tony Stark: Re-route everything. We get one shot at this.

[Barton and Natasha are making their way to the lifeboats]

Clint Barton: I know what I need to do. The dining room! If I knock out that east wall, it'll make a nice work space for Laura, huh? Put up some baffling, she can't hear the kids running around, what do you think?

Natasha Romanoff: You guys always eat in the kitchen anyway.

Clint Barton: No one eats in a dining room. [they reach the lifeboats] We don't have a lot of time.

Natasha Romanoff: So get your ass on a boat. [Natasha finds the Hulk] Hey, big guy. Sun's getting real low.

[Barton gets onto one of the lifeboats, but notices a woman calling out for someone]

Zrinka: Costel? We were in the market. Costel?!

[Barton runs off to find the boy]

Tony Stark: Thor, I'm gonna need you back in the church.

Thor: [referring to the people getting onto the lifeboats; to Steve] Is this the last of them?

Steve Rogers: Yeah. Everyone else is on the carrier.

Tony Stark: You know, if this works, we maybe don't walk away.

Thor: Maybe not.

[As Natasha tries to calm Hulk down to get him back to being Banner Ultron flies in with a jet and starts shooting at them]

Ultron: [sings] I got no strings, so I have fun. I'm not tied up to anyone. [as Barton is saving the boy, Costel, Ultron starts shooting at them. Barton prepares to take the shots to save the kid, but Pietro runs into the line of fire and takes the shots to save both of them]

Pietro Maximoff: You didn't see that coming. [Pietro falls to the ground as he dies. In the church, Wanda senses his death, causing her to fall in despair, and release a wave of energy that destroys all the robots around her.]

[Hulk drops Natasha off onto the Helicarrier and then jumps onto the jet Ultron is on]

Ultron: Oh, for God's sake!

[Hulk throws Ultron out of the jet and he crashes inside a train; at the same time Barton delivers Costel safely to his sister onto the lifeboat, a man goes over to help him with his wounds]

Clint Barton: No, no. I'm fine. [Barton lies down next to the dead body of Pietro] Oh, it's been a long day.

[Wanda then finds Ultron]

Ultron: Wanda. If you stay here, you'll die.

Wanda Maximoff: I just did. Do you know how it felt? [she uses her power to rip Ultron's core out of his body] It felt like that.

[One remaining robot turns the key in the church, and the city starts falling]

[Stark fires a powerful blast to the core underneath the floating city]

Tony Stark: Thor, on my mark. [Thor brings on a blast of lightning, at the same time Vision flies in, picks up Wanda and flies off with her as the city is being destroyed] Now!

[Thor uses his hammer to hit the Vibranium core in the church, destroying the core and the floating city]

Natasha Romanoff: [to Hulk from a screen as he remains on the jet he knocked Ultron out of] Hey, big guy. We did it, the job's finished. Now I need you to turn this bird around, okay? We can't track you in stealth mode, so help me out. I need you t-- [Hulk turns off Natasha's camera, then sits as the jet flies off to an unknown destination]

[Vision finds Ultron]

Vision: You're afraid.

Ultron: Of you?

Vision: Of death. You're the last one.

Ultron: You were supposed to be the last. Stark asked for a savior, and settled for a slave.

Vision: I suppose we're both disappointments.

Ultron: [Ultron chuckles] I suppose we are.

Vision: Humans are odd. They think order and chaos are somehow opposites, and try to control what won't be. But there is grace in their failings. I think you missed that.

Ultron: They're doomed.

Vision: Yes. But a thing isn't beautiful because it lasts. It's a privilege to be among them.

Ultron: You're unbearably naive.

Vision: Well, I was born yesterday. [as Ultron goes to attack him Vision uses the infinity stone in his head to destroy him]

[We see Barton returning to his family on the farm, followed by Stark driving to the new Avengers facility in upstate New York]

Laura Barton: [From a video of Barton's new baby on Natasha's phone] Say hi to Auntie Nat. [Natasha sees the baby has been named Nathaniel Pietro Barton]

Natasha Romanoff: Fat.

Nick Fury: One of our tech boys flagged this, splashed down in the Banda Sea. Could be the Quinjet. But with Stark's stealth tech, we still can't track the damn thing.

Natasha Romanoff: Right.

Nick Fury: Probably jumped out and swam to Fiji. He'll send a postcard.

Natasha Romanoff: "Wish you were here." You sent me to recruit him, way back when. Did you know then what was going to happen?

Nick Fury: You never know. You hope for the best and make do with what you get. I got a great team.

Natasha Romanoff: Nothing lasts forever.

Nick Fury: Trouble, Miss Romanoff. No matter who wins or loses, trouble still comes around.

Steve Rogers: The rules have changed.

Tony Stark: We're dealing with something new.

Steve Rogers: Well, the Vision's artificial intelligence.

Tony Stark: A machine.

Steve Rogers: So it doesn't count.

Tony Stark: No. It's not like a person lifting the hammer.

Steve Rogers: Right. Different rules for us.

Tony Stark: Nice guy, but artificial.

Steve Rogers: Thank you.

Thor: If he can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone. It's safe with the Vision and these days, safe is in short supply.

Steve Rogers: But if you put the hammer in an elevator...

Tony Stark: It would still go up.

Steve Rogers: Elevator's not worthy.

Thor: I'm going to miss these little talks of ours.

Tony Stark: Well, not if you don't leave.

Thor: I have no choice. The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years. That's not a coincidence. Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us. But once all these pieces are in position...

Tony Stark: Triple Yahtzee?

Steve Rogers: You think you can find out what's coming?

Thor: I do. [In reference to Stark] Besides this one, there's nothing that can't be explained. [Thor returns to Asgard, and the Bifrost burns a sigil in the grass he was standing on]

Tony Stark: That man has no regard for lawn maintenance. I'm gonna miss him though. And you're gonna miss me. There's gonna be a lot of manful tears. [as they walk over towards Stark's car]

Steve Rogers: I will miss you, Tony.

Tony Stark: Yeah? Well, it's time for me to tap out. Maybe I should take a page out of Barton's book and build Pepper a farm, hope nobody blows it up.

Steve Rogers: The simple life.

Tony Stark: You'll get there one day.

Steve Rogers: I don't know, family, stability. The guy who wanted all that went in the ice seventy-five years ago. I think someone else came out. [Stark turns to get into his car]

Tony Stark: You alright?

Steve Rogers: I'm home. [Stark gets into his car; Steve finds Natasha standing alone] You want to keep staring at the wall, or do you want to go to work? I mean, it's a pretty interesting wall.

Natasha Romanoff: I thought you and Tony were still gazing into each other's eyes. How do we look?

Steve Rogers: Well, we're not the '27 Yankees. [hands Natasha a tablet]

Natasha Romanoff: We've got some hitters.

Steve Rogers: They're good. They're not a team.

Natasha Romanoff: Let's beat 'em into shape. [they gather Rhodes in his War Machine suit, Vision, Sam in his Falcon suit, and Wanda in a new outfit.]

Steve Rogers: Avengers...!

[mid-credits scene; we see the Infinity Gauntlet without any of the Stones, dissatisfied Thanos opens a vault and puts on The Infinty Gauntlet, revealing himself]

Thanos: Fine, I'll do it myself.

          "And there came a day, a day unlike any other, when Earth's
          mightiest heroes and heroines found themselves united against a
          common threat. On that day, the Avengers were born--to fight the
          foes no single superhero could withstand! Through the years,
          their roster has prospered, changing many times, but their glory

          Kneeling behind a THRONE, a CLOTHED, ARMORED FIGURE known as THE
          OTHER, bows.

           THE OTHER (V.O.)
           The Tesseract has awakened. It is on a
           little world. A human world. They would
           wield its power,...

           But our ally knows its workings as they

           The world will be his. The universe

          EXT. S.H.I.E.L.D. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S FACILITY  NIGHT

          Out in the NEW MEXICO desert, a remote research facility is in a
          state of panic. It's an evacuation. A SWOOPING helicopter flies
          in.

          CHAOS. Men in suits run around like in the typical `we have to
          leave' fashion. Soldiers on foot jump onto Humvees, accelerating
          the hell out of there. A VOICE bellows from hidden loudspeakers.

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

          Standing a few yards from the landing pad, A Fed in a suit with
          badass shades, peers at the helicopter as it lands. This is

          SHIELD AGENT PHIL COULSON.

          Walking out of the helicopter is SHIELD AGENT MARIA HILL, SEXY,
          FIERCE AND DETERMINED. Following her, SHIELD DIRECTOR NICK FURY
          climbs out. Hill and Fury approach Agent Coulson.

                          NICK FURY
           How bad is it?

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

          Agent Coulson leads Hill and Fury through the radiation section
          of the facility. Hundreds of technicians and other staff run
          around, taking only the essentials.

                       AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Dr. Selvig read an energy surge from
           the Tesseract four hours ago.

                          NICK FURY
           NASA didn't authorize Selvig to test
           phase.

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He wasn't testing it, he wasn't even in
           the room. Spontaneous advancement.

                        AGENT MARIA HILL
           It just turned itself on?

                          NICK FURY
           What are the energy levels now?

                        AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Climbing. When Selvig couldn't shut it
           down, we ordered the evac.

                          NICK FURY
           How long to get everyone out?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Campus should be clear in the next half
           hour.

                          NICK FURY
           Do better.

          CONTINUOUSLY HEADING DOWN TO RADIATION FACILITY FLOOR

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, evacuation may be futile.

                          NICK FURY
           We should tell them to go back to
           sleep?

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           If we can't control the Tesseract's
           energy, there may not be a minimum safe
           distance.

                          NICK FURY
           I need you to make sure that PHASE 2
           prototypes are shipped out.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, is that really a priority right
           now?

                          NICK FURY
           Until such time as the world ends, we
           will act as though it intends to spin
           on. Clear out the tech below. Every
           piece of PHASE 2 on a truck and gone.

                          AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.
           (to standing agents)
           With me.

          INT. NASA SPACE RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  CONTINUOUS

          Fury enters the lab facility where the Tesseract is being held
          by a COMPACT MUON SOLENOID COIL CHAMBER.

                          NICK FURY
           Talk to me, doctor.
          DR. ERIK SELVIG emerges from behind the CMS machine, concerned.
          The Tesseract is glowing unusually brighter and flare rings
          shoot out at random.

                          SELVIG
           Director.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything we know for certain?

                          SELVIG
           Tesseract is misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           Is that supposed to be funny?

                          SELVIG
           No, it's not funny at all. The
           Tesseract is not only active,
           she's...misbehaving.

                          NICK FURY
           How soon until you pull the plug?

                          SELVIG
           She's an energy source. If we turn off
           the power, she turns it back on. If she
           reaches peak level...

                          NICK FURY
           We've prepared for this, doctor.
           Harnessing energy from space.

                          SELVIG
           We don't have the harness. Our
           calculations are far from complete. Now
           she's throwing off interference,
           radiation. Nothing harmful, low levels
           of gamma radiation.

                          NICK FURY
           That can be harmful. Where's Barton?

                          SELVIG
           The Hawk? Up in his nest, as usual.
          We see CLINT BARTON, dressed in black tactical gear, is up on
          the railings watching them below, Fury calls Barton on his
          earpiece.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Barton, report.
          BARTON rappels down from the catwalk. Walks up to Fury. They
          both walk around the facility in a discreet manner.

                          NICK FURY
           I gave you this detail so you could
           keep a close eye on things.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Well, I see better from a distance.

                          NICK FURY
           Are you seeing anything that might set
           this thing off?

                          NASA SCIENTIST

                          (TO SELVIG)
           Doctor, it's spiking again.

                          CLINT BARTON
           No one's come or gone. It's oven is
           clean. No contacts, no I.M.'s. If there
           was any tampering, sir, it wasn't at
           this end.

                          NICK FURY
           At this end?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah, the cube is a doorway to the
           other end of space, right? The doors
           open from both sides.
          DR. SELVIG clacks away at the keyboard and sees on the
          monitoring his worst nightmares. Suddenly- the Tesseract
          THUNDERS and SHAKES the entire facility. Big enough where both
          Agents Hill and Coulson can feel and they're at different ends
          of the facility.
          The flaring rings and glow of the cube spout out brighter and
          louder, like a boiling pot of water. The Tesseract's energy
          builds up into a BEAM much like the Bifrost Bridge, which HITS
          at the end of a platform that is wired to the CMS device. The
          great maelstrom beam FIRES the TESSERACT energy. The beam then
          forms a VORTEX, which then opens up a PORTAL.
          A BLACK HOLE IS CREATED. From the portal, the blackness of
          SPACE, beautiful and mysterious, strewn with a billion stars
          appears and a GUST of BLUE ENERGY CLOUDS fill the room, blinding
          everyone.
          The Tesseract's energy forms into a cloud that reaches to the
          top the facility's vacuum chamber ceiling. It's abnormally
          quiet. Then... HEAVY BREATHING is heard from the platform.
          SHIELD GUARDS slowly approach, weapons in hands. A figure is
          kneeling on the platform, smoke coming off it. It's LOKI.
          Smiling in his mischievous manner, he raises his head. The smile
          dies down. He looks deep into the eyes of Fury, Barton and
          Selvig. He stands up, holing the scepter.

                          NICK FURY
           Sir, please put down the spear!
          Loki looks at his spear then suddenly points it at where Fury
          and Barton are standing and SHOOTS OUT A BLUE EXPLODING LIGHT
          TOWARDS THEM. BARTON TACKLES Fury and they both barely miss
          Loki's fired shot.
          ALL HELL BREAKS. Machine gun fire is shot at Loki, but the
          bullets bounce off him like a boss. Loki jumps high from the
          platform and ATTACKS those firing at him.
          In the blink of an eye, Loki takes down several guards with his
          KNIVES and ENERGY BLASTS from the scepter. He stops and waits to
          see who will attack him next. Honestly, the whole lab has almost
          gone to shit.
          Barton tries to stand up. Loki quickly walks towards him. Barton
          raises his gun, but Loki grabs Barton's hand.

                          LOKI
           You have heart.
          Loki points the head of his spear at Barton's head. Barton's
          eyes suddenly glow BLACK. The ability to control Barton's mind
          is now in Loki's hand. Barton puts his piece away and stands
          straight.
          As Loki is busy using his abilities to control the minds of
          several S.H.I.E.L.D. personnel, Fury takes the Tesseract,
          placing it back into its case and tries to leave the lab.Then...

                          LOKI
           Please don't. I still need that.

                          NICK FURY

                          (TURNING)
           This doesn't have to get any messier.

                          LOKI
           Of course it does. I've come too far
           for anything else. I am Loki of Asgard,
           and I am burdened with glorious
           purpose.

                          SELVIG
           Loki? Brother of Thor?

                          NICK FURY
           We have no quarrel with your people.

                          LOKI
           An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

                          NICK FURY
           You planning to step on us?

                          LOKI
           I come with glad tidings, of a world
           made free.

                          NICK FURY
           Free from what?

                          LOKI
           Freedom. Freedom is life's great lie.
           Once you accept that, in your heart...
          Like a gunslinger, Loki turns to face Selvig who's
          standingbehind him and places his spear against Selvig's heart.
          Selvig's eyes glow BLACK.

                          LOKI
           You will know peace.

                          NICK FURY
           Yeah, you say peace, I kind of think
           you mean the other thing.
          From the vacuum chamber ceiling, Tesseract's energy cloud
          RAPIDLY builds into what may be an implosion.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Sir, Director Fury is stalling. This
           place is about to blow. Drop a hundred
           feet of rock on us. He means to bury
           us.

                          NICK FURY
           Like The Pharaohs of Odin.

                          SELVIG
           He's right. The portal is collapsing in
           on itself. You got maybe two minutes
           before this goes critical.

                          LOKI
           Well, then...
          Loki, looking at Barton, who doesn't even hesitate, SHOOTS FURY
          WHO FALLS TO THE GROUND. Barton grabs the case containing the
          Tesseract and leaves the lab with Loki, Selvig and the other
          S.H.I.E.L.D personnel Loki is controlling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER, ENTRANCE OF EXITING TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Loki, Barton, Selvig and the other S.H.I.E.L.D personnel are in
          the parking lot of the facility, quickly gathering certain
          weapons. Agent Hill watches in confusion, referring to Loki.

                          CLINT BARTON
           (pointing to the Loki team)
           Need these vehicles.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Who's that?

                          CLINT BARTON
           He didn't tell me.
          Agent Hill looks suspiciously at them as they get into the truck
          and turns to leave, as she's walking away...

                          NICK FURY
           (through the walkie talkie)
           Hill, do you copy?!
          Loki and Barton SHARPLY look at Agent Hill.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is sitting up, pulling out the bullet, breathing heavily.

                          NICK FURY
           Barton is...

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER  NIGHT

          Suddenly, Hill turns to SHOOT AT BARTON, but Barton is already
          POINTING HIS GUN at her and starts SHOOTING, he moves the
          driver's seat of the truck and DRIVES OFF as Hill keeps
          shooting.

          BACK AT THE LAB
          Fury is holding his side, running.

                          NICK FURY
           He's got the Tesseract! Track it down!
          The energy is really brewing a fucking shit storm from the
          vacuum chamber ceiling.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S BUNKER/TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill SLIPS into a JEEP and follows after Barton's
          truck.Loki's trucks SCREECH across the tunnel. Several SHIELD
          trucks pull up to them. A drive-by shooting ensues.
          Loki, who stands on top of the bed of the truck, uses his
          scepter and EMITS energy blasts, flipping over SHIELD trucks.
          They get in, the cars roar out after them. Agent Hill puts
          herself at a distance.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR  NIGHT

          Fury races out of the hallway, avoiding falling pipes. The
          entire facility is now in a full earthquake.

          INT. FACILITY FLOOR, ELSEWHERE  CONTINUOUS

          Agent Coulson and several SHIELD agents fall down the steps,
          dropping SILVER CASES of information. They attempt to grab them,
          but...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No! Leave it!
          They run out of there like a bat from hell.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill's JEEP ROARS out of a side of Barton's truck and
          pulls up alongside them on the left. She goes way ahead and
          pulls her brake, swerving into a 360, facing Barton's truck and
          driving in reverse.
          Barton's ARMS reach out the open window and OPENS FIRE. Agent
          Hill figures `fuck it' and SHOOTS her windshield OPENING FIRE on
          Barton.

          EXT. VAN  NIGHT

          Agent Coulson jumps into a SHIELD VAN. On his walkie:

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're clear, sir! You need to go!

          EXT. HELICOPTER PAD  CONTINUOUS

          Fury BOLTS out of the facility and jumps into a helicopter. The
          surface of the pad gives way, PLUNGING the helicopter through
          the surface. But Fury's chopper BARELY makes it out.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Still in a chase and drive-by sequence, Barton's pushes the
          pedal harder, which causes Agent Hill's JEEP to WOBBLE out and
          put her back behind.

          INT. RADIATION FACILITY, VACUUM CHAMBER  NIGHT

          The Tesseract's energy cloud now SHRINKS into a SMALL BALL OF
          WHITE LIGHT. Then...

          A CLOUD OF BLUE LIGHT CONSUMES THE ENTIRE FACILITY AND PARTS OF
          THE DESERT. Fury watches from below, a RAPID build-up into what
          may be an implosion. Several miles away, Agent Coulson's van
          feels a JOLT of the Tesseract's BLASTWAVE. THE ENTIRE FACILITY

          SWALLOWS INTO ITSELF-- A TERRIFYING, UNIMAGINABLE IMPLOSION.

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          The BLASTWAVE of the Tesseract causes the tunnel to cave it.
          Like an ocean wave, blinding crumbles of falling rock, fall onto
          Agent Hill's JEEP, leaving her NEARLY trapped under this blanket
          of rock.
          On the Barton's truck, they escape the tunnel and drive into the
          desert landscape. Fury's helicopter ROARS over Barton's truck.
          Loki looks up.
          From the chopper's door, it slides open and Fury stands there,
          holding a gun, SHOOTING at Barton's, giving an honoring image of

          JULES WINNFIELD.
          Loki looks at Fury and in a fit of RAGE, points his scepter
          SHOOTS OUT THE BLUE LIGHT. The chopper CATCHES on fire, GOING
          DOWN in a FIERY BALL. Fury, like the boss he is, JUMPS OUT and
          touches down onto the desert floor. The chopper BARRELS along
          the ground.
          Fury, coming back to his senses, FIRES at Loki, but they're
          toofar and too late. Loki looks back, smiling. Fury stands
          there, MIND REELING. Then...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Director? Director Fury, do you copy?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is with the hostile
           force. I have men down. Hill?

          INT. P.E.G.A.S.U.S TUNNEL  NIGHT

          Agent Hill climbs out her JEEP, which is sandwiched in, but
          luckily, not her.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           A lot of men still under, don't know
           how many survivors.

          EXT. DESERT  NIGHT


                          NICK FURY
           Sound the general call. I want every
           living soul not working rescue looking
           for that brief case.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           Roger that.

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson, get back to base. This is a
           LEVEL SEVEN. As of right now, we are at
           war.
          A beat.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON

                          (WALKIE TALKIE)
           What do we do?
          Fury stands there. Thinking. He looks up. On his face is sign of
          hope.

                         THE AVENGERS

          EXT. RUSSIA, SOLENSKI PLAZA, 3RD FLOOR  NIGHT

          Out in the outskirts, near a railroad, a still in construction
          building is being occupied by GEORGI LUCHKOV, a LARGE, RUSSIAN
          GENERAL along with his THUGS.
          TALL THUG is in the middle of a brutal beating on NATASHA
          ROMANOFF, a SLEWING, FOXY, UNBELIEVABLY SEXY SPY. He BACKHANDS
          NATASHA'S face. She feels the pain, but does not breakdown.
          LUCHKOV, smiling, walks up to her. Dialogue is in RUSSIAN.

                          LUCHKOV
           This is not how I wanted the evening to
           go.

                          NATASHA
           I know how you wanted this evening to
           go. Believe me, this is better.

                          LUCHKOV
           I'd like to know why they sent you to
           carry out a carrier, a stained glass
           and other random items.
          TALL THUG rocks her chair back, balancing her off the edge of an
          open floor. Natasha is now scared.

                          NATASHA
           I thought General Soholob was in charge
           of the export business.

                          LUCHKOV
           Soholob? Your reputation is quite a
           progression. THE FAMOUS BLACK WIDOW.
           Nothing but a pretty face.

                          NATASHA
           You really think I'm pretty?
          LUCHKOV slowly walks over to a table filled with tools. He picks
          up a pair of pliers. TALL THUG opens up her mouth wide open.

                          LUCHKOV
           We do not need the Lermontov to
           transfer the tanks. Tell him, well,...

                          (IN ENGLISH)
           You may have to write it down.
          Suddenly, WEASELLY THUG'S cell rings. Confused, he answers.

                          WEASELLY THUG
           Ya?
           (looks at LUCHKOV)
           It's for you.
          LUCHKOV takes the phone, pissed.

                          LUCHKOV
           Who the hell is...

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're at 114 Solenski Plaza, 3rd floor.
           We have an F22 exactly 8 miles out. Put
           the woman on the phone or I will blow
           up the block before you can make the
           lobby.
          HOLY SHIT. LUCHKOV places the cell phone against Natasha's ear
          seeing how she's tied to a chair with her hands tied behind her
          back.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to come in.

                          NATASHA
           Are you kidding? I'm working!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This takes precedence.

                          NATASHA
           I'm in the middle of an interrogation
           and this moron is giving me everything.

                          LUCHKOV
           I don't give everything.
          Natasha gives him a look.

                          NATASHA
           Look, you can't pull me out of this
           right now.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Natasha. Barton's been compromised.
          A beat.

                          NATASHA
           Let me put you on hold.
          She nods to LUCHKOV. As Luchkov comes to take the phone off her,
          Natasha HITS him with her leg and HEADBUUTS him. Like a spider,
          she stands up elegantly and starts ATTACKING TALL THUG by
          KICKBOXING him in the face.
          Still tied, she ROLLS over WEASELLY THUG after she trips him.
          She then STOMPS on TALL THUG foot with peg of the chair, then

          KNOCKS HIM OUT WITH HER HEAD.
          Yeah, during all this Coulson is still waiting on the line. She
          then FLIPS over and FALLS down hard on WEASELLY THUG, BREAKING
          THE CHAIR. She sees TALL THUG stand.
          Giving her momentum, she runs at him DROP KICKING him, FALLS
          DOWN and FLIPS right back up and WRAPS HER LEGS AROUND HIS NECK

          AND KNOCKS HIM OUT COLD.
          She grabs LUCHKOV, wraps his leg around with a hanging chain and
          drops him down the open floor, dangling. She picks up the phone
          and her heels, like a boss.

                          NATASHA
           Where's Barton now?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We don't know.

                          NATASHA
           But he's alive.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We think so. I'll brief you on
           everything when you get back. But
           first, we need you to talk to the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
           about as far as he can throw me.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No, I've got Stark. You get the big
           guy.

                          NATASHA
           Bozhe moi.

          EXT. INDIAN SLUM  NIGHT

          A LITTLE GIRL runs through the crowd, trying to force a way
          through.

          INT. SHACK  NIGHT

          A tiny shack. The LITTLE GIRL runs up the steps, only to be
          stopped by an attending woman. Then, the LITTLE GIRL spots him.
          BRUCE BANNER, their LOCAL doctor.

                          ATTENDING WOMAN
           What are doing here?! Get out! You
           shouldn't be here!

                          LITTLE GIRL
           I have to see the doctor! It's my
           father!

                          BANNER
           Calm down. What's wrong?

                          LITTLE GIRL
           My father...
          Banner looks behind him seeing how the girl is staring at a few
          people, lying down, looking very sick.

                          BANNER
           Is he like them?
          The LITTLE GIRL holds out all the money she has in the world.

                          LITTLE GIRL
           Please.

          EXT. SLUMS  CONTINUOUS

          Banner and the LITTLE GIRL hastily run nearly to the edge of
          town. The LITTLE GIRL gets ahead of herself. Banner spots local
          government car, he turns around, blocking any view of him.

          EXT/INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Banner quickly follows the LITTLE GIRL inside her house. As he
          walks in, the LITTLE GIRL ESCAPES THROUGH THE WINDOW. Banner is
          left standing there like a dumbass.

                          BANNER
           Should have got paid up front, Banner.
          Natasha then appears from behind the curtains. Banner turns
          around, quietly.

                          NATASHA
           You know, for a man who's supposed to
           be avoiding stress, you picked a hell
           of a place to settle.

                          BANNER
           Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

                          NATASHA
           Then, what is it? Yoga?

                          BANNER
           You brought me to the edge of the city,
           smart. I uh... assume the whole place
           is surrounded?

                          NATASHA
           Just you and me.

                          BANNER
           And your actress buddy, is she a spy
           too? Do they start that young?

                          NATASHA
           I did.

                          BANNER
           Who are you?

                          NATASHA
           Natasha Romanoff.

                          BANNER
           Are you here to kill me, Miss Romanoff?
           Because that's not gonna work out for
           everyone.

                          NATASHA
           No. No. Of course not. I'm here on
           behalf of SHIELD.

                          BANNER
           SHIELD. How did they find me?

                          NATASHA
           We never lost you, doctor. We've kept
           our distance, even helped keep some
           other interested parties off your
           scent.

                          BANNER
           Why?

                          NATASHA
           Nick Fury seems to trust you. But now I
           need you to come in.

                          BANNER
           What if I said no?

                          NATASHA
           I'll persuade you.

                          BANNER
           And what if the... other guy says no?

                          NATASHA
           You've been more than a year without an
           incident. I don't think you wanna break
           that streak.

                          BANNER
           I don't always get what I want.

                          NATASHA
           Doctor, we're facing a potential global
           catastrophe.

                          BANNER
           Well, those I actively try to avoid.

                          NATASHA
           This is the Tesseract. It has the
           potential energy to wipe out the
           planet.
          She shows him a photo of the Tesseract on her cell phone. Banner
          takes a closer look.

                          BANNER
           What does Fury want me to do? Swallow
           it?

                          NATASHA
           Well, he wants you to find it. It's
           been taken. It emits a gamma signature
           that's too weak for us to trace.
           There's no one that knows gamma
           radiation like you do. If there was,
           that's where I'd be.

                          BANNER
           So Fury isn't after the monster?

                          NATASHA
           Not that he's told me.

                          BANNER
           And he tells you everything?

                          NATASHA
           Talk to Fury, he needs you on this.

                          BANNER
           He needs me in a cage?

                          NATASHA
           No one's gonna put you in a...

                          BANNER

           STOP LYING TO ME!
          The THUNDEROUS TONE in is voice makes Natasha QUICKLY grab her
          gun and point it at him, but something is now OFF in the
          atmosphere. Banner stands straight up, smiling.

                          BANNER
           I'm sorry, that was mean. I just wanted
           to see what you'd do. Why don't we do
           this the easy way, where you don't use
           that, and the other guy doesn't make a
           mess? Okay? Natasha...
          Natasha, still wary, doesn't lower her gun. She lowers her gun
          and speaks into her earpiece.

                          NATASHA
           Stand down. We're good here.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Amazingly, DOZENS OF SHIELD AGENTS are surrounding the shack
          outside.

          INT. LITTLE GIRL'S SHACK  NIGHT

          Banner looks at Natasha, charming a smile at her.

                          BANNER
           Just you and me?
          Natasha fidgets now that she exposed her guard down.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  NIGHT

          Fury is facing several LARGE MONITORS as he as a conference with
          members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           This is out of line, Director. You're
           dealing with forces you can't control.

                          NICK FURY
           You ever been in a war, Councilman? In
           a firefight? Did you feel an
           overabundance of control?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           You saying that this Asgard has
           declared war on our planet?

                          NICK FURY
           Not Asgard. Loki.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           He can't be working alone. What about
           the other one? His brother.

                          NICK FURY
           Our intelligence says, Thor is not a
           hostile. But he's worlds away, we can't
           depend on him to help. It's up to us.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Which is why you should be focusing on
           phase 2, it was designed for exactly...

                          NICK FURY
           PHASE 2 isn't ready, our enemy is. We
           need a response team.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

                          NICK FURY
           This isn't about The Avengers.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           We're running the world's greatest
           covert security network and you're
           gonna leave the fate of human race to a
           handful of freaks.

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not leaving anything to anyone. We
           need a response team. These people
           maybe isolated, unbalanced even, but I
           believe with the right push they can be
           exactly what we need.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           You believe?

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

                          NICK FURY
           No, it's won by soldiers.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Somewhere in an old, almost WWII-esque boxing gym, STEVE ROGERS,
          a man out of time, THE FIRST AVENGER, FUCKIN' CAPTAIN AMERICA is
          PUMMELING a punching bag. With every swing, it's like a memory
          he's trying to fight off and repress.

          EXT. HYDRA BASE  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Captain America is running through the forest, dodging mortars,
          gunfire and the Tesseract's energy firearms.

           STEVE (V.O.)
           There's not enough time! I gotta put
           her in the water!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve's rage keeps building as he punches the bag. It gets
          harder...

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          Steve places his COMPASS with an image of PEGGY CARTER. The time
          is here for him to crash the plane.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve closes his eyes. Goes at the bag harder.

           PEGGY (V.O.)
           You won't be alone.

          INT. HORTEN H.XVIII, RED SKULL'S SHIP  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          The RED SKULL picks up the TESSERACT.

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve opens his eyes and fuckin' tears the bag as the last
          memory kicks in. I don't think he can physically stop...

           SHIELD SCIENTIST (V.O.)
           Oh my god!

          INT. PROJECT P.E.G.A.S.U.S, ANTARCTICA  DAY (FLASHBACK)

          A half frozen Steve Roger is lying down on a medical slab. Two
          SHIELD SCIENTISTS run over hi-tech devices to see if his vitals
          are up. And it seems...

                          SHIELD SCIENTIST
           This guy is still alive!

          INT. BROOKLYN GYM  NIGHT

          Steve FUCKING tears the bag open, off its chain, spilling out
          the sand. He stands, breathing hard, letting out 70 years of
          over repressed feeling.
          After taking a few breathers, Steve picks up another punching
          bag, which is laying next another DOZEN BAGS. He hooks the bag
          up and starts punching again. Fury walks in.

                          NICK FURY
           Trouble sleeping?

                          STEVE
           I slept for seventy years, sir. I think
           I've had my fill.

                          NICK FURY
           Then you should be out, celebrating,
           seeing the world.
          Steve stops punching and walks over to the bench, unraveling the
          tape off his hands. He sits down.

                          STEVE
           I went under, the world was at war, I
           wake up, they say we won. They didn't
           say what we lost.

                          NICK FURY
           We've made some mistakes along the way.
           Some very recently.

                          STEVE
           You here with a mission, sir?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

                          STEVE
           Trying to get me back in the world?

                          NICK FURY
           Trying to save it.
          Fury hands Steve a file on the Tesseract, along with other files
          on HYDRA'S projects.

                          STEVE
           Hydra's secret weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           Howard Stark fished that out of the
           ocean when he was looking for you. He
           thought what we think, the Tesseract
           could be the key to unlimited
           sustainable energy. That's something
           the world sorely needs.

                          STEVE
           Who took it from you?

                          NICK FURY
           He's called Loki. He's not from around
           here. There's a lot we'll have to bring
           you up to speed on if you're in. The
           world has gotten even stranger than you
           already know.

                          STEVE
           At this point, I doubt anything would
           surprise me.

                          NICK FURY
           Ten bucks says you're wrong. There's a
           debriefing package waiting for you back
           at your apartment.
          Steve turns and picks up a punching bag. Starts walking out of
          the gym.

                          NICK FURY
           Is there anything you can tell us about
           the Tesseract that we ought to know
           now?

                          STEVE
           You should have left it in the ocean.

          INT. OCEAN  NIGHT

          Out in the Atlantic Ocean, TONY STARK, in his IRON MAN suit, is
          cutting a PIPELINE TRANSPORT with a laser cutter coming from his
          hand. He then places a STARK ENERGY REACTOR. It lights up. IRON
          MAN rockets out of the water and flies towards STARK TOWER.

                          TONY
           You're good on this end. The rest is up
           to you.

                          PEPPER POTTS
           (on the other line)
           You disconnected the transition lines?
           Are we off the grid?

          INSIDE THE SUIT -- PEPPER APPEARS ON HIS HUD MONITOR.

                          TONY
           Stark Tower is about to become a beacon
           of self-sustaining clean energy.

                          PEPPER
           Wow. So maybe our reactor takes over
           and it actually works?

                          TONY
           I assume. Light her up.
          As IRON MAN flies to the STARK TOWER BUILDING, the power is
          switched on and the STARK sign LIGHTS UP.

                          PEPPER
           How does it look?

                          TONY
           Like Christmas, but with more... me.

                          PEPPER
           Gotta go wider on the public awareness
           campaign. You need to do some press. I
           can do some more tomorrow. I'm working
           on the zoning for the next billboards.

                          TONY
           Pepper, you're killing me. Remember?
           Enjoy the moment.

                          PEPPER
           Then get in here and I will.
          TONY arrives at his skyscraper penthouse and is in the process
          of taking off his IRON MAN suit through a hi-tech gauntlet of
          gadgets.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, Agent Coulson of SHIELD is on the
           line.

                          TONY
           I'm not in. I'm actually out.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

                          TONY
           Close the line Jarvis. I got a date.

          INT. TONY'S PENTHOUSE  NIGHT

          PEPPER POTTS stares up at the monitors of the reactor device.

                          PEPPER
           Levels are holding steady... I think.

                          TONY
           Of course they are, I was directly
           involved. Which brings me to my next
           question: how does it feel to be a
           genius?

                          PEPPER
           Well, ha, I really wouldn't know now,
           would I?

                          TONY
           What do you mean? All this came from
           you.

                          PEPPER
           No. All this came from that.
          Points to the energy in his chest plate.

                          TONY
           Give yourself some credit, please.
           Stark Tower is your baby. Give
           yourself... twelve percent of the
           credit.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent?

                          TONY
           An argument can be made for fifteen.

                          PEPPER
           Twelve percent? For my baby?

                          TONY
           Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.
           Literally, I lifted the heavy things.
           And sorry, but the security snafu? That
           was on you.

                          PEPPER
           Oooooh.

                          TONY
           My private elevator...

                          PEPPER
           You mean OUR elevator?

                          TONY
           ...was teeming with sweaty workmen. I'm
           going to pay for that comment about
           percentages in some subtle way later,
           aren't I?
          Pepper pours herself and Tony a glass of champagne.

                          PEPPER
           Not gonna be that subtle.

                          TONY
           I'll tell you what. Next building's
           gonna say 'Potts' on the tower.

                          PEPPER
           On the lease.

                          TONY
           ...Call your mom, can you bunk over?

                          JARVIS
           Sir, the telephone. I'm afraid my
           protocols are being overwritten.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Stark, we need to talk. Tony picks up
           his phone and looks into it at Coulson.

                          TONY
           You have reached the life model decoy
           of Tony Stark, please leave a message.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This is urgent.

                          TONY
           Then leave it urgently.
          At that moment the elevator door opens and Coulson appears.

                          TONY
           Security breach.

                          (TO PEPPER)
           That's on you.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Mr. Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Phil! Come in.

                          TONY
           Phil? Uh, his first name is Agent.

                          PEPPER
           Come on in, we're celebrating.

                          TONY
           Which is why he can't stay.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We need you to look this over.
           (he holds out a file towards

                          STARK)
           Soon as possible.

                          TONY
           I don't like being handed things.

                          PEPPER
           That's alright, `cause I love to be
           handed things. So, let's trade.
          She passes her glass of champagne to Coulson and takes the file
          from him, then takes her champagne glass back from Coulson and
          passes the file over to Stark.

                          PEPPER
           Thank you.

                          TONY
           Official consulting hours are between
           eight and five every other Thursday.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't a consultation.

                          PEPPER
           Is this about The Avengers? Which I...I
           know nothing about.

                          TONY
           The Avengers Initiative was scrapped, I
           thought. And I didn't even qualify.

                          PEPPER
           I didn't know that either.

                          TONY
           Yeah, apparently I'm volatile, self-
           obsessed, don't play well with others.

                          PEPPER
           That I did know.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           This isn't about personality profiles
           anymore.

                          TONY
           Whatever. Miss Potts, got a minute?
          Pepper walks over to Tony who places the files into his own
          databases.

                          TONY
           You know, I thought we were having a
           moment.

                          PEPPER
           I was having twelve percent of a
           moment. This seems serious, Phil's
           pretty shaken.

                          TONY
           How did you notice? Why is he Phil?

                          PEPPER
           What is all of this?

                          TONY
           This is, uh...
          Tony EXPANDS his arms and different profiles appear in
          holographic form floating in the air in front of Tony and
          Pepper.

                          TONY
           This.
          Screens appear of CAPTAIN AMERICA IN ACTION, the HULK ROARING AS

          HE ATTACKS THE ARMY AT CULVER UNIVERSITY, THOR FIGHTING THE
          DESTROYER and another is of Loki and the Tesseract, to which
          Stark and Pepper look on in awe.

                          PEPPER
           I'm going to take the jet to D.C.
           tonight.

                          TONY
           Tomorrow.

                          PEPPER
           You've got homework. You've got a lot
           of homework.

                          TONY
           Well, what if I didn't?

                          PEPPER
           If you didn't?

                          TONY
           Yeah.

                          PEPPER
           You mean if you finished?
           (Stark nods his head)
           Well, um...then...
          She whispers something in his ear. Tony GASPS. Coulson looks
          away in embarrassment.

                          TONY
           Square deal. It's the last date.
          Pepper kisses him.

                          PEPPER
           Work hard.
          As Pepper leaves with Agent Coulson, Tony grabs the Tesseract in
          holograph form, worried.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          Inside the QUINJET, Steve is sitting down, holding a TABLET,
          watching the footage of the Hulk's attack on the Army at Culver
          University.

                          PILOT
           We're about forty minutes out from
           base, sir.
          Agent Coulson stands up from his seat and walks over to Steve.

                          STEVE
           So, this Doctor Banner was trying to
           replicate the serum that was used on
           me?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           A lot of people were. You were the
           world's first superhero. Banner thought
           gamma radiation might hold the key to
           unlocking Erskine's original formula.
          The Hulk roars with fury as he slams a jeep apart.

                          STEVE
           Didn't really go his way, did it?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Not so much. When he's not that thing
           though, guy's like a Stephen Hawking.
          Steve looks confused.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He's like a smart person. I gotta say,
           it's an honor to meet you, officially.
          Steve smiles at Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I sort of met you, I mean, I watched
           you while you were sleeping.
          Steve looks down. He stands up, closes his laptop and walks to
          the side with Coulson following.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, I was... I was present while
           you were unconscious from the ice. You
           know, it's really, it's just a... just
           a huge honor to have you on board.

                          STEVE
           Well, I hope I'm the man for the job.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Oh, you are. Absolutely. Uh... we've
           made some modifications to the uniform.
           I had a little design input.

                          STEVE
           The uniform? Aren't the stars and
           stripes a little... old fashioned?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           With everything that's happening, the
           things that are about to come to light,
           people might just need a little old
           fashioned.
          Steve takes in Coulson's sentiment.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB  DAY

          Several soldiers under Loki's mind control run around, preparing
          to infiltrate whatever Loki has planned. Loki sits down,
          watching Selvig work with a CMS device. Loki meditates, until...

          EXT. THRONE ROOM  NIGHT

          ...the scepter materializes him back into the throne room of THE
          OTHER, fully armed in his horned helmet and armor. THE OTHER
          appears from the steps.

                          THE OTHER
           The Chitauri grow restless.

                          LOKI
           Let them go at themselves. I will lead
           them into glorious battle.

                          THE OTHER
           Battle? Against the meager might of
           Earth?

                          LOKI
           Glorious, not lengthy. If your force is
           as formidable as you claim.

                          THE OTHER
           You question us? You question HIM? He,
           who put the scepter in your hand, who
           gave you ancient knowledge and new
           purpose when you were cast out,
           defeated?

                          LOKI
           I was a king! The rightful king of
           Asgard! Betrayed!

                          THE OTHER
           Your ambition is little, born of
           childish need. We look beyond the Earth
           to greater worlds the Tesseract will
           unveil.

                          LOKI
           You don't have the Tesseract yet.
          THE OTHER runs over to attack him, but stops as Loki points his
          scepter.

                          LOKI
           I don't threaten, but until I open the
           doors, until your force is mine to
           command, you are but words.

                          THE OTHER
           You will have your war, Asgardian. If
           you fail, if the Tesseract is kept from
           us, there will be no realm, no barren
           moon, no crevice where he can't find
           you. You think you know pain? He will
           make you long for something as sweet as
           pain.
          THE OTHER places his hand on Loki's head and transports him back
          to Earth. Loki looks around, menacing.

          EXT. HELICARRIER LANDING STRIP  DAY

          The QUINJET lands down a MASSIVE BATTLESHIP known as the
          HELICARRIER. It has two runways. One with direct access to a
          hangar at the rear is aligned along the spine of the vessel.
          Agent Coulson and Steve walk down the ramp, meeting up with
          Natasha.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Agent Romanoff. Captain Rogers.

                          STEVE
           Ma'am?

                          NATASHA
           Hi.

                          (TO COULSON)
           They need you on the bridge. Face time.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           See you there.
          Agent Coulson walks away leaving Steve with Natasha, walking
          towards the railing of the ship.

                          NATASHA
           There was quite the buzz around here,
           finding you in the ice. I thought
           Coulson was gonna swoon. Did he ask you
           to sign his Captain America trading
           cards yet?

                          STEVE
           Trading cards?

                          NATASHA
           They're vintage, he's very proud.
          Without realizing, Banner doesn't notice them walking as he
          isnervous as hell. He moves around as people keep walking in
          hisway.

                          STEVE
           Dr. Banner.
          Steve walks up to Banner and shakes his hands.

                          BANNER
           Oh, yeah. Hi. They told me you'd be
           coming.

                          STEVE
           Word is you can find the cube.

                          BANNER
           Is that the only word on me?

                          STEVE
           Only word I care about.

                          BANNER
           (takes in the sentiment)
           Must be strange for you, all of this.

                          STEVE
           Well, this is actually kind of
           familiar.

                          NATASHA
           Gentlemen, you may wanna step inside in
           a minute. It's gonna get a little hard
           to breath.
          Suddenly the HELICARRIER starts SHAKING as it prepares to fly
          "sail."

                          STEVE
           Is this is a submarine?

                          BANNER
           Really? They wanted me in a submerged
           pressurized metal container?
          They both move closer to the edge of the HELICARRIER. FOUR HUGE

          LIFT FANS MOUNTED ON THE SIDES STARTS TO LIFT INTO THE AIR IN
          VTOL FLIGHT. Steve watches in AWE as Banner smiles.

                          BANNER

           OH, NO. THIS IS MUCH WORSE.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          The doors part and we enter THE BRIDGE OF THE SHIP  a flurry of
          activity  dozens of agents sit in front of their VIEWSCREENS.
          Agent Hill shouts her instructs to leave. Turns to NICK FURY,
          who is at the command chair.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We're at lock, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Good. Let's vanish.

          EXT. SKY

          The HELICARRIER rises high into the heavens. Suddenly, the
          entire ship is covered in reflecting mirrors, which then
          camouflages in the sky.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  CONTINUOUS

          Steve and Banner walk through the glorious, gleaming bridge,
          taking his position at the SCIENCE CONSOLE.

                          NICK FURY
           Gentlemen.
          Steve gives Fury 10 bucks, referring to his earlier statement
          about never being surprised again. Fury walks over Banner and
          extends his hand. Banner, reluctantly shakes it.

                          NICK FURY
           Doctor, thank you for coming.

                          BANNER
           Thanks for asking nicely. So, uh... how
           long am I staying?

                          NICK FURY
           Once we get our hands on the Tesseract,
           you're in the clear.

                          BANNER
           Where are you with that?
          Nick Fury turns to Agent Coulson to explain, while Natasha
          Romanoff eyes an image of Clint Barton on a computer screen.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           We're sweeping every wirelessly
           accessible camera on the planet.
           Cellphones, laptops. If it's connected
           to a satellite, it's eyes and ears for
           us.

                          NATASHA
           That's still not gonna find them in
           time.

                          BANNER
           You have to narrow the field. How many
           spectrometers do you have access to?

                          NICK FURY
           How many are there?

                          BANNER
           Call every lab you know, tell them to
           put the spectrometers on the roof and
           calibrate them for gamma rays. I'll
           rough out a tracking algorithm based on
           cluster recognition. At least we could
           rule out a few places. Do you have
           somewhere for me to work?

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you show
           Dr.Banner to his laboratory, please.
          Natasha nods and walks off, leading Banner down the hall.

                          NATASHA
           You're gonna love it, Doc. We got all
           the toys.

          INT. UNDERGROUND LAB, VACUUM ROOM  DAY

          Selvig and several scientists work around the CMS device.
          Bartonwalks in, holding a tablet.

                          SELVIG
           Put it over there!

                          (TO BARTON)
           Where did you find all these people?

                          CLINT BARTON
           SHIELD has not shortage of enemies,
           Doctor.
          He holds up a screen showing information on IRIDIUM.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Is this the stuff you need?

                          SELVIG
           Yeah, iridium. It's found in
           meteorites, it forms anti-protons. It's
           very hard to get hold of.

                          CLINT BARTON
           Especially if SHIELD knows you need it.

                          SELVIG
           Well, I didn't know!
           (sees Loki coming)
           Hey! The Tesseract is showing me so
           much. It's more than just knowledge,
           it's... truth.

                          LOKI
           I know. What did it show you, Agent
           Barton?

                          CLINT BARTON
           My next target.

                          LOKI
           Tell me what you need.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I'll need a distraction.
           (grabs his bow)
           And an eyeball.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  NIGHT

          As they are waiting to locate Loki using satellite facial
          recognition, Coulson and Steve stand side by side, waiting.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

                          STEVE
           No, no. It's fine.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's a vintage set. It took me a couple
           of years to collect them all. Near
           mint, slight foxing around the edges,
           but...

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           We got a hit. Sixty-seven percent
           match. Weight, cross match, seventy-
           nine percent.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Location?

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL
           Stuttgart, Germany. 28, Konigstrasse.
           He's not exactly hiding.

                          NICK FURY
           Captain, you're up.
          Steve nods. Leaves.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Loki standing in front of the museum, dressed in 21st century
          attire and with the scepter, disguised as a cane, walks up to
          the entrance of the gala.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          Inside, a lavished gala with an orchestra playing, is
          interrupted as the HEAD DOCTOR walks up to the mic.

          INT. HELICARRIER, STEVE'S LOCKER  NIGHT

          Steve walks into his own locker room. As he approaches to the
          steel cabinet, the doors already reveal the updated CAPTAIN
          AMERICA UNIFORM, along with the famous SHIELD. He stands in
          silence.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Outside the museum, GERMAN GUARDS stand in their positions. One
          of them is standing on top of the roof, scoping. He then hears a

          THWACK!
          He looks down. One of his guards is shot with an ARROW. He
          raises his gun. He is shot dead by an arrow. Falls down. Barton
          and his CREW arrive at the doors of the locked science building.
          Barton looks at the retinal scanner. He pulls out a SHIELD eye
          scanner instrument.

          INT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          Loki looks from above the museum and descends down to where the
          HEAD DOCTOR is. As he makes it down and near the stage, he FLIPS
          his cane the other end. The guard there notices him, pulls out
          his gun, but Loki CLUBS his head in. CHAOS ERUPTS.
          Guests begin to leave the museum. Loki grabs the doctor and
          flips him over onto a marble table of the mythological creatures
          BILCHSTEIM. Loki pulls out an OPTICAL TORTURE DEVICE. He PLUNGES
          down the doctor's eye. The doctor TWISTS in pain.

          EXT. STUTTGART MUSEUM  NIGHT

          Suddenly, from Barton's instrument, a holographic eye of the
          head doctor appears and the image of the doctor appears on
          screen.
          The doors to the facility open. Barton walks in and finds in a
          cabinet, a glass thermos with a cylinder of iridium.

          EXT. STUTTGART GALA  NIGHT

          As the crowd runs away, Loki slowly walks out and materializes
          in his gold armor and helmet. The POLICE arrive and with no
          hesitation, he BLASTS the cars, FLIPPING them over and over.

                          LOKI
           Kneel before me.
          The crowd ignores him. Another LOKI appears, blocking the crowd.
          Loki after Loki appears, they all grin as they raise their
          spears, encircling the crowd.

                          LOKI
           I said. KNEEL!!!
          Everyone becomes quiet and kneels in front him. Loki embracing
          his arms out, smiling.

                          LOKI
           Is not this simpler? Is this not your
           natural state? It's the unspoken truth
           of humanity, that you crave
           subjugation. The bright lure of freedom
           diminishes your life's joy in a mad
           scramble for power, for identity. You
           were made to be ruled. In the end, you
           will always kneel.
          As the words resonate to the kneeling crowd, an ELDER GERMAN MAN
          refuses to kneel and stands, heroic.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           Not to men like you.

                          LOKI
           There are no men like me.

           ELDER GERMAN MAN
           There are always men like you.

                          LOKI
           Look to your elder, people. Let him be
           an example.
          Loki is about to execute him with his scepter as the light GLOWS
          blue. Just as the ENERGY BEAM shoots out, FUCKING CAPTAIN
          AMERICA arrives! He dives in just in time and BLOCKS the blast
          with his SHIELD, knocking down Loki on his ass.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You know, the last time I was in
           Germany and saw a man standing above
           everybody else, we ended up
           disagreeing.

                          LOKI

                          (STANDING UP)
           The soldier. A man out of time.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm not the one who's out of time.
          From above Cap, the QUINJET arrives. A machine gun is pointed
          towards Loki.

                          NATASHA
           Loki, drop the weapon and stand down.
          Like greased lighting, Loki sends a BLAST of blue at the
          QUINJET. Natasha MANEUVERS it just in time, giving Cap the time
          to throw his shield at Loki. They both begin to DUKE IT OUT.
          Loki FLINGS Cap to the ground. Cap then throws his shield, but
          Loki SWATS it way. Cap, using all the moves of a boxer, is
          KNOCKED down by Loki. Standing over him, he points the scepter's
          tip on his helmet.

                          LOKI
           Kneel.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Not today!
          Cap FLIPS and KNOCKS him out with his leg. Loki grabs him and
          FLIPS him over.

          INT. QUINJET  NIGHT


                          NATASHA
           The guy's all over the place.
          Suddenly, AC/DC's "Shoot to Thrill" overdrives the QUINJET'S
          speakers.

                          IRON MAN
           Agent Romanoff, did you miss me?
          Both Cap and Loki look up at the sky. Tony flies over in his
          IRON MAN suit and blasts Loki right back to the ground. IRON MAN
          touches down. He stands up and pulls out every piece of weaponry
          the suit has.

                          IRON MAN
           Make your move, Reindeer Games.
          Loki puts up his hands and surrenders. His armor materializes
          away.

                          IRON MAN
           Good move.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Mr. Stark.

                          IRON MAN
           Captain.

          INT. QUINJET  NIGHT

          Natasha watches the skies. THUNDER. Coming out of nowhere. Fury
          speaks over her headset.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Said anything?

                          NATASHA
           Not a word.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Just get him here. We're low on time.
          With Loki tied up and cuffed to his seat, Tony and Steve watch
          from a distance, whispering.

                          STEVE
           I don't like it.

                          TONY
           What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?

                          STEVE
           I don't remember it being ever that
           easy. This guy packs a wallop.

                          TONY
           Still, you are pretty spry, for an
           older fellow. What's your thing?
           Pilates?

                          STEVE
           What?

                          TONY
           It's like calisthenics. You might have
           missed a couple things, you know, doing
           time as a Capsicle.
          Steve looks at Tony, finally meeting his ego match.

                          STEVE
           Fury didn't tell me he was calling you
           in.

                          TONY
           Yeah, there's a lot of things Fury
           doesn't tell you.
          THUNDER and LIGHTNING nearly hit the jet, making it shake
          violently.

                          NATASHA
           Where's this coming from?
          Thunder RUMBLES overhead. Loki stares out the window intently.

                          STEVE
           What's the matter? Scared of a little
           lightning?

                          LOKI
           I'm not overly fond of what follows.
          What the fuck? OUTSIDE THE JET A BLINDING LIGHT hits the jet.
          Not a light. A King.
          THE MIGHTY THOR. Thor OPENS the ramp and grabs Loki by the
          throat and flies out. Steve and Tony are left dumbstruck. Tony
          puts the IRON MAN helmet on.

                          IRON MAN
           Now there's that guy.

                          NATASHA
           Another Asgardian?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Think the guy's a friendly?

                          IRON MAN
           Doesn't matter. If he frees Loki or
           kills him, the Tesseract's lost.
          Tony turns and gets ready to jump off the jet to chase after
          Thor.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, we need a plan of attack!

                          IRON MAN
           I have a plan. Attack.
          IRON MAN jumps out of the jet and chases after Thor. Cap grabs a
          parachute to follow.

                          NATASHA
           I'd sit this one out, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I don't see how I can.

                          NATASHA
           These guys come from legends, they're
           basically gods.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           There's only one God, ma'am. And I'm
           pretty sure he doesn't dress like that.
          Cap JUMPS OUT of the jet.

          EXT. MOUNTAIN LEDGE  NIGHT

          Somewhere out in the European mountains, Thor throws Loki into
          the side of the mountain. He raises the mighty hammer, MJ�LNIR.
          He looks down at his brother, who he thought to be dead and is
          angry to see him alive in this fashion.

                          THOR
           Where is the Tesseract?

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           I missed you too.

                          THOR
           Do I look to be in a gaming mood?!

                          LOKI
           Oh, you should thank me. With the
           Bifrost gone how much dark energy did
           the Allfather have to muster to conjure
           you here? Your precious Earth.
          Thor drops MJ�LNIR, causing the mountain to quake. He picks up
          Loki. His brother.
          Although Thor is pissed for what he has done, a family is
          everything to a man or god.

                          THOR
           I thought you dead.

                          LOKI
           Did you mourn?

                          THOR
           We all did. Our father...

                          LOKI
           Your father. He did tell you my true
           parentage, did he not?
          Thor lets go Loki, who walks away from Thor, causing an even
          bigger wedge between them.

                          THOR
           We were raised together, we played
           together, we fought together. Do you
           remember none of that?

                          LOKI

                          (TURNS AROUND)
           I remember a shadow. Living in the
           shade of your greatness. I remember you
           tossing me into an abyss. I was and
           should be king!

                          THOR
           So you take the world I love as
           recompense for your imagined slights.
           No, the Earth is under my protection,
           Loki.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           And you're doing a marvelous job with
           that. The humans slaughter each other
           in droves, while you idly threat. I
           mean to rule them. And why should I
           not?

                          THOR
           You think yourself above them.

                          LOKI
           Well, yes.

                          THOR
           Then you miss the truth of ruling,
           brother. Throne would suit you ill.
          Angrily, Loki shoves his brother to the side. He walks back up
          to the ledge. Turns around.

                          LOKI
           I've seen worlds you've never known
           about! I have grown, Odinson, in my
           exile! I have seen the true power of
           the Tesseract, and when I wield it...

                          THOR
           Who showed you this power? Who controls
           the would-be-king?

                          LOKI
           I am a king!

                          THOR
           Not here! You give up the Tesseract!
           You give up this poisonous dream! You
           come home.

                          LOKI
           I don't have it. You need the cube to
           bring me home, but I've sent it off I
           know not where.
          Mj�lnir flies back to his grasp.

                          THOR
           You listen well, brother. I...

          THOR IS KNOCKED OFF THE MOUNTAIN BY IRON MAN WHO TACKLES HIM IN

          MID-FLIGHT.

                          LOKI
           I'm listening.

          EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN CRASH into the forest. Thor rolls himself up.
          IRON MAN is still standing, but keeps his distance. The helmet
          opens up.

                          THOR
           Do not touch me again!

                          TONY
           Then don't take my stuff.

                          THOR
           You have no idea what you're dealing
           with.

                          TONY
           Shakespeare in the park? Doth mother
           know you weareth her drapes?

                          THOR
           This is beyond you, metal man. Loki
           will face Asgardian justice!

                          TONY
           He gives up the Cube, he's all yours.
           Until then, stay out of my way...
           tourist.
          The IRON MAN helmet clamps up and he walks away. In one quick
          move, Thor pulls Mj�lnir, throws it, and KNOCKS IRON MAN clear
          across into a tree.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Okay.
          From the mountain side, Loki watches in amusement. Thor raises
          his hand. Mj�lnir flies back to his hand. Thor SWINGS the
          hammer, summoning a ray of energy.
          IRON MAN stands up and from his HAND BOOSTERS, a BLAST of ENERGY
          KNOCKS the MIGHTY AVENGER on his ass. IRON MAN flies back up and
          knocks Thor into a tree. Right back at you, bitch!
          Thor, kneeling on the ground, pulls Mj�lnir to his hand, raises
          it to the skies and pulls in LIGHTING and THUNDER! Thor points
          the hammer at IRON MAN and the outpouring of bolts lighting
          increases in intensity. IRON MAN falls back.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Power at 400% capacity.

                          TONY
           How about that?
          IRON MAN FIRES AWAY FROM HIS HAND BOOSTERS, pushing Thor to his
          knees. Like two gunslingers ready to draw, both Thor and IRON
          MAN fly towards each other and meet in the middle and ascend up.

          EXT. SKY  NIGHT

          The two battle. IRON MAN grasps THOR, elbowing him and SMASHING
          him into the side of a mountain.
          THOR LEAPS off the mountain and takes IRON MAN with him.

          EXT. FOREST  CONTINUOUS

          THOR and IRON MAN crash right back down, smashing down every
          tree possible. IRON MAN YANKS Thor right up. Thor grabs both
          HANDS BOOSTERS and begins to CRUSH them. Tony quickly CHARGES as
          much energy as he can and SHOOTS ENERGY in Thor's face.
          Thor FALLS back, losing his stance. IRON MAN HEADBUTTS Thor,
          with his gold-titanium alloy helmet. Thor... HEADBUTTS him with
          his fuckin' head and actually sends IRON MAN across the forest.
          IRON MAN boosters up and flies back at Thor, grabbing him by the
          arm and cape and SWINGS him into another tree. Thor looks up,
          ready. Thor runs with all his patience out the window. IRON MAN
          SWINGS and MISSES, giving Thor the momentum to grab him, lift
          him and SMASH him down hard.
          Thor summons back Mj�lnir to his hand. Just as he's about to put
          the hammer down, IRON MAN uses his HAND BOOSTERS to SKID across
          the ground and trip Thor over. Standing up, Thor looks for him,
          but from behind him, IRON MAN CRASHES into his back. Thor stands
          facing IRON MAN. Ready to pounce...
          CAPTAIN AMERICA'S shield RICOCHETS off both Thor and IRON MAN,
          stopping them. They look up and see CAPTAIN AMERICA standing on
          top of a fallen tree with the shield back in hand.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Hey! That's enough!
           (comes down; looks at Thor)
           Now, I don't know what you plan on
           doing here.

                          THOR
           I've come here to put an end to Loki's
           schemes!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Then prove it! Put the hammer down.

                          IRON MAN
           Um, yeah, no! Bad call! He loves his
           hammer!

          THOR BACKHANDS IRON MAN LIKE A PIMP WITH MJ�LNIR.
          Thor, losing all tolerance with this SENTENTIAL OF LIBERTY,
          raises the hammer.

                          THOR

                          (TO CAP)
           You want me to put the hammer down?

          THOR LEAPS HIGH INTO THE AIR, RAISING THAT FUCKING HAMMER.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA CROUCHES DOWN and HOLDS UP HIS SHIELD. THOR
          brings that hammer down onto the shield and a MASSIVE IMPLOSION
          OF LIGHT reacts to the vibranium shield creating a MASSIVE

          SHOCKWAVE THAT BLOWS UP ANYTHING STANDING WITHIN A MILE.
          IRON MAN stands up, looking around like `holy shit.' Lying right
          next to him is Cap, who never takes his eye off Thor. Thor looks
          at both men.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are we done here?

          THOR, CAPTAIN AMERICA AND IRON MAN STAND THERE.

          INT. HELICARRIER HALLWAY  NIGHT

          DOZENS of SHIELD POLICE escort Loki, who is in handcuffs,
          smiling. As they pass the HELICARRIER LAB, Banner stops working
          on the CHITAURI SCEPTER and looks up. Loki eyes him as he walks,
          nodding and smiling. BANNER rubs his head.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki is now free from his cuffs and is contained in a LARGE
          GLASS CELL held by HYDRAULIC RIGS. Fury walks up the control
          panel of the cell.

                          NICK FURY
           In case it's unclear. You try to
           escape. You so much as scratch that
           glass.
          Fury presses a button which OPENS UP a HATCH underneath Loki's
          cell. Loki peers as much as he can from the glass.
          Without seeing, the sounds of GUSTING WIND would make man shit
          his pants. Not a god, though.

                          NICK FURY
           Thirty thousand feet, straight down in
           a steel trap. You get how that works?!
          Fury closes the hatch. Points at Loki.

                          NICK FURY
           Ant.
          Then points at the button which would drop Loki into the steel
          trap.

                          NICK FURY
           Boot.

                          LOKI

                          (SMIRKING)
           It's an impressive cage. Not built, I
           think, for me.

                          NICK FURY
           Built for something a lot stronger than
           you.

                          LOKI
           Oh, I've heard.
          Loki looks into the camera.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          The others watch on the monitor Loki getting interrogated.
          Banner looks at the monitor, intently.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  CONTINUOUS


                          LOKI
           The mindless beast, makes play he's
           still a man. How desperate are you,
           that you call upon such lost creatures
           to defend you?

                          NICK FURY
           How desperate am I? You threaten my
           world with war. You steal a force you
           can't hope to control.

                          (MORE)

           NICK FURY (CONT'D)
           You talk about peace and you kill
           `cause it's fun. You have made me very
           desperate. You might not be glad that
           you did.

                          LOKI
           Ooh. It burns you to come so close. To
           have the Tesseract, to have power,
           unlimited power. And for what? A warm
           light for all mankind to share, and
           then to be reminded what real power is.

                          NICK FURY

                          (SMILING)
           Well, you let me know if Real Power
           wants a magazine or something.
          Fury walks off leaving Loki in his glass cell. Loki looks back
          at the camera, smirking.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  CONTINUOUS

          Steve watches until the monitor goes black. Thor, who didn't
          even look, just listened, stands there, torn apart. They all
          just stand there in stunned SILENCE. Finally --

                          BANNER
           He really grows on you, doesn't he?

                          STEVE
           Loki's gonna drag this out. So, Thor,
           what's his play?

                          THOR

                          (COMING TOO)
           He has an army called the Chitauri.
           They're not of Asgard or any world
           known. He means to lead them against
           your people. They will win him the
           earth. In return, I suspect, for the
           Tesseract.

                          STEVE

                          (SERIOUSLY)
           An army? From outer space?

                          BANNER
          So he's building another portal. That's
          what he needs Erik Selvig for.

                          THOR
          Selvig?

                          BANNER
          He's an astrophysicist.

                          THOR
          He's a friend.

                          NATASHA
          Loki has him under some kind of spell,
          along with one of ours.

                          STEVE
          I wanna know why Loki let us take him.
          He's not leading an army from here.

                          BANNER
          I don't think we should be focusing on
          Loki. That guy's brain is a bag full of
          cats, you could smell crazy on him.

                          THOR
          Have care how you speak. Loki is beyond
          reason, but he is of Asgard, and he's
          my brother.

                          NATASHA
          He killed eighty people in two days.

                          THOR
          He's adopted.

                          BANNER
          Iridium, what did they need the Iridium
          for?

                          TONY
          It's a stabilizing agent.
           (walks in with Coulson; to

                          COULSON)
          I'll fly you there. Keep the love
          alive. Means the portal won't collapse
          on itself, like it did at SHIELD.

                          TONY (CONT'D)

                          (TO THOR)
           No hard feelings, Point Break. You've
           got a mean swing.
           (referring to the Iridium)
           Also, it means the portal can open as
           wide, and stay open as long, as Loki
           wants.

                          (TO CREW)
           Uh, raise the mid-mast, ship the top
           sails. That man is playing GALAGA!
           Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.
           (covering his eye, looks

                          AROUND)
           How does Fury do this?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           He turns.
          Tony looks around the monitors and places a BUTTON SIZE HACKING
          IMPLANT under Fury's desk, without anyone noticing.

                          TONY
           Well, that sounds exhausting. The rest
           of the raw materials, Agent Barton can
           get his hands on pretty easily. Only
           major component he still needs is a
           power source. A high energy density,
           something to kick start the cube.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           When did you become an expert in
           thermonuclear astrophysics?

                          TONY
           Last night. The packet, Selvig's notes,
           the Extraction Theory papers. Am I the
           only one who did the reading?

                          STEVE
           Does Loki need any particular kind of
           power source?

                          BANNER
           He's got to heat the cube to a
           hundredand twenty million Kelvin just
           to break through the Coulomb barrier.

                          TONY
           Unless, Selvig has figured out how to
           stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.

                          BANNER
           Well, if he could do that he could
           achieve Heavy Ion Fusion at any reactor
           on the planet.

                          TONY
           Finally, someone who speaks English.

                          STEVE
           Is that what just happened?
          Tony and Banner shake hands. A glimmer in their eyes shines as
          the mutual respect for each other shows.

                          TONY
           It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.
           You're work on anti-electron collisions
           is unparalleled. And I'm a huge fan of
           the way you lose control and turn into
           an enormous green rage monster.

                          BANNER

                          (LOOKS DOWN)
           Thanks.

                          NICK FURY

                          (WALKING IN)
           Dr. Banner is only here to track the
           cube. I was hoping you might join him.

                          STEVE
           Let's start with that stick of his. It
           may be magical, but it works an awful
           lot like a HYDRA weapon.

                          NICK FURY
           I don't know about that, but it is
           powered by the cube. And I'd like to
           know how Loki used it to turn two of
           the sharpest men I know into his
           personal flying monkeys.

                          THOR
           Monkeys? I do not understand.

                          STEVE
           I do! I understood that reference.
          Tony rolls his eyes, while Cap looks proud of himself.

                          TONY
           Shall we play, doctor?

                          BANNER
           Let's play some.
          As Banner and Tony walk out, the GALAGA PLAYER turns ever so
          discreetly, watches as everyone else disperses and goes back to
          playing.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB - NIGHT (LATER)

          Banner continuously scans with a gamma ray detection scanner on
          the scepter for radiation.
          Tony looks at his monitors, shifting and solving as many
          algorithms and equations.

                          BANNER
           The gamma readings are definitely
           consistent with Selvig's reports on the
           Tesseract. But it's gonna take weeks to
           process.

                          TONY
           If we bypass their mainframe and direct
           a reroute to the Homer cluster, we can
           clock this around six hundred
           teraflops.

                          BANNER
           All I packed was a tooth brush.

                          TONY

                          (SMILES)
           You know, you should come by STARK
           TOWERS sometime. Top ten floors, all
           R&D. You'd love it, it's candy land.

                          BANNER
           Thanks, but the last time I was in New
           York I kind of broke...Harlem.

                          TONY
           Well, I promise a stress free
           environment. No tension. No surprises.
          Suddenly, Tony pokes Banner with a MINIATURE ELECTRICAL PROD.
          Steve walks in on them, pissed at Tony.

                          BANNER

           OW!
          Tony looks at Banner closely.

                          TONY
           Nothing?

                          STEVE

                          (TO BANNER)
           Hey! Are you nuts?

                          TONY
           You really have got a lid on it,
           haven't you? What's your secret? Mellow
           jazz? Bongo drums? Huge bag of weed?

                          STEVE
           Is everything a joke to you?

                          TONY
           Funny things are.

                          STEVE
           Threatening the safety of everyone on
           this ship isn't funny. No offense,
           doctor.

                          BANNER
           No, it's alright. I wouldn't have come
           aboard if I couldn't handle pointy
           things.

                          TONY
           You're tiptoeing, big man. You need to
           strut.

                          STEVE
           And you need to focus on the problem,
           Mr. Stark.

                          TONY
           You think I'm not? Why did Fury call us
           and why now? Why not before? What isn't
           he telling us? I can't do the equation
           unless I have all the variables.

                          STEVE
           You think Fury's hiding something?

                          TONY
           He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His
           secrets have secrets.
           (points to Banner)
           It's bugging him too, isn't it?

                          BANNER
           (bobbling the words)
           Uh...I just wanna finish my work here
           and...

                          STEVE
           Doctor?
          A beat.

                          BANNER
           'A warm light for all mankind, Loki's
           jab at Fury about the cube.

                          STEVE
           I heard it.

                          BANNER
           (pointing at Tony)
           Well, I think that was meant for you.
           Even if Barton didn't post that all
           over the news.

                          STEVE
           The Stark Tower? That big ugly
           (Tony gives him a look)
           ...building in New York?

                          BANNER
          It's powered by Stark Reactors, self-
          sustaining energy source. That building
          will run itself for what, a year?

                          TONY
          That's just the prototype. I'm kind of
          the only name in clean energy right
          now.

                          BANNER
           (referring to Tony)
          So, why didn't SHIELD bring him in on
          the Tesseract project? I mean, what are
          they doing in the energy business in
          the first place?

                          TONY
          I should probably look into that once
          my decryption programmer finishes
          breaking into all of SHIELD's secure
          files.

                          STEVE
           (taken by that)
          I'm sorry, did you say...?

                          TONY
          Jarvis has been running it since I hit
          the bridge. In a few hours we'll know
          every dirty secret SHIELD has ever
          tried to hide.
           (holds out a bag of blueberries)
          Blueberry?

                          STEVE
          Yet you're confused about why they
          didn't want you around?

                          TONY
          An intelligence organization that fears
          intelligence? Historically, not
          possible.

                          STEVE
           I think Loki's trying to wind us up.
           This is a man who means to start a war,
           and if don't stay focused, he'll
           succeed. We have orders, we should
           follow them.

                          TONY
           Following is not really my style.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           And you're all about style, aren't you?

                          TONY
           (a nerve hit)
           Of the people in this room, which one
           is; A. wearing a spangly outfit, and B.
           not of use?

                          BANNER
           Steve, tell me none of this smells a
           little funky to you?
          Steve takes in the possibility, but as an obedient soldier,
          shakes it off.

                          STEVE
           Just find the cube.
          Steve walks out of the lab. Still torn apart by the possibility,
          he walks away, towards the HULL of the ship.

          BACK IN THE LAB

                          TONY
           That's the guy my dad never shut up
           about? Wondering if they shouldn't have
           kept him on ice.

                          BANNER
           The guy's not wrong about Loki. He does
           have the jump on us.

                          TONY
           What he's got is an ACME dynamite kit.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           It's gonna blow up in his face, and I'm
           gonna be there when it does.

                          BANNER
           And I'll read all about it.

                          TONY
           Uh-huh. Or you'll be suiting up like
           the rest of us.

                          BANNER
           Ah, see. I don't get a suit of armor.
           I'm exposed, like a nerve. It's a
           nightmare.

                          TONY
           You know, I've got a cluster of
           shrapnel, trying every second to crawl
           its way into my heart.
           (points at the MINI-ARC
           REACTOR in his chest)
           This stops it. This little circle of
           light. It's part of me now, not just
           armor. It's a... terrible privilege.

                          BANNER
           But you can control it.

                          TONY
           Because I learned how.

                          BANNER
           It's different.
          Banner tries to read the computer screen, but Tony slides the
          data aside with his finger so the two can see face-to-face.

                          TONY
           Hey, I've read all about your accident.
           That much gamma exposure should have
           killed you.

                          BANNER
           So you're saying that the Hulk... the
           other guy... saved my life?

                          (MORE)

                          BANNER (CONT'D)
           That's nice. It's a nice sentiment.
           Saved it for what?

                          TONY

                          (A BEAT)
           I guess we'll find out.
          Banner and Stark get back to work at their respective computers.

                          BANNER
           You might not like that.

                          TONY
           You just might.

          INT. HULL HANGAR, SECURE STORAGE 10-C  NIGHT

          Steve, with all his MIGHT, slides the HEAVY IRON door and
          STEALTHILY walks in. SECURE STORAGE 10-C is a large warehouse,
          filled with METAL CRATES stacked.
          Steve looks up, seeing another level. He LEAPS up high and holds
          onto the catwalk railing. Steve continues to move forward.

          INT. VAN  NIGHT

          Inside this particular van, Selvig and a few other SOLDIERS are
          driving inside a long tunnel. With the CMS device inside, Selvig
          carefully picks up the small cylinder shape IRIDIUM with metal
          prongs and lightly places it a SLOT within the CMS. THE CMS
          ACCEPTS IT. Selvig looks at it, devilishly smiling.

          INT. BRIEFING ROOM  NIGHT

          On a SHIELD monitor is a photo and record of JANE FOSTER. Thor
          looks at her, remembering. With him is Agent Coulson.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           As soon as Loki took the doctor we
           moved Jane Foster. We've got an
           excellent observatory in Traunsee. She
           was asked to consult there very
           suddenly yesterday. Handsome fee,
           private plane, very remote. She'll be
           safe.

                          THOR
           Thank you. It's no accident Loki taking
           Erik Selvig. I dread what he plans for
           him once he's done. Erik is a good man.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           He talks about you a lot. You changed
           his life. You changed everything around
           here.

                          THOR
           They were better as they were. We
           pretend on Asgard that we're more
           advanced, but we...we come here
           battling like BILCHSTEIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Like what?

                          THOR
           BILCHSTEIM? You know; huge, scaly, big
           antlers. You don't have those?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Don't think so.

                          THOR
           They are repulsive, and they trample
           everything in their path.
          Thor walks over to the side of the ship and looks out the
          window, lamenting about what has happened and what may come.

                          THOR
           When I first came to earth, Loki's rage
           followed me here and your people paid
           the price. And now again. In my youth I
           courted war.

           NICK FURY (O.S.)
           War hasn't started yet.

                          (WALKING IN)
           You think you can make Loki tell us
           what the Tesseract is?

                          THOR
           I do not know. Loki's mind is far
           afield, it's not just power he craves,
           it's vengeance upon me. There's no pain
           that would prize his need from him.

                          NICK FURY
           A lot of guys think that, until the
           pain stops.

                          THOR
           What are you asking me to do?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm asking. What are you prepared to
           do?

                          THOR
           Loki is a prisoner.

                          NICK FURY
           Then why do I feel like he's the only
           person on this boat that wants to be
           here?
          Thor doesn't answer.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki walks back and forth inside his glass cell. Suddenly, he
          stops.

                          LOKI
           There's not many people that can sneak
           up on me.
           (turns to see NATASHA

                          STANDING THERE)

                          NATASHA
           But you figured I'd come.

                          LOKI
           After. After whatever tortures Fury can
           concoct, you would appear as a friend,
           as a balm. And I would cooperate.

                          NATASHA
          I wanna know what you've done to Agent
          Barton.

                          LOKI
          I'd say I've expanded his mind.

                          NATASHA
          And once you've won. Once you're king
          of the mountain. What happens to his
          mind?

                          LOKI
          Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

                          NATASHA
          Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

                          LOKI

                          (SITTING DOWN)

                          WELL)
          Before I worked for SHIELD, I
          uh...well, I made a name for myself. I
          have a very specific skillset. I didn't
          care who I used it for, or on. I got on
          SHIELD's radar in a bad way. Agent
          Barton was sent to kill me, he made a
          different call.

                          LOKI
          And what will you do if I vow to spare
          him?

                          NATASHA
          Not let you out.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
          Ah, no. But I like this. Your world in
          the balance, and you bargain for one
          man?

                          NATASHA
           Regimes fall every day. I tend not to
           weep over that, I'm Russian... or was.

                          LOKI
           What is it you want?

                          NATASHA
           It's really not that complicated. I've
           got red in my ledger, I'd like to wipe
           it out.

                          LOKI
           Can you? Can you wipe out that much
           red? DRAKOV'S daughter? S�O PAULO? THE
           HOSPITAL FIRE? Barton told me
           everything. Your ledger is dripping,
           it's gushing red, and you think saving
           a man no more virtuous than yourself
           will change anything?

                          (STANDING; ANGRY)
           This is the basest sentimentality. This
           is a child at prayer... PATHETIC!

                         INTERCUTS
          - Tony and Banner continuously work at their monitors.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You lie and kill in the service of
           liars and killers.
          - Agent Hill checks every VIEWSCREEN in the bridge. Fury
          oversees.

           LOKI (V.O.)
           You pretend to be separate, to have
           your own code, something that makes up
           for the horrors. But they are a part of
           you, and they will never go away!
          - Steve opens a STEEL crate. Angry, he looks behind him and
          looks back into the crate. THE CRATE IS FILLED WITH AN ARRAY OF

          HYDRA WEAPONS.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  NIGHT

          Loki SLAMS his cell, making Natasha FLINCH.

                          LOKI
           I won't touch Barton. Not until I make
           him kill you! Slowly. Intimately. In
           every way he knows you fear! And when
           he'll wake just long enough to see his
           good work, and when he screams, I'll
           split his skull! This is my bargain,
           you mewling quim!
          NATASHA turns around, walks away from Loki, disgusted.

                          NATASHA

                          (QUIETLY; DISTRAUGHT)
           You're a monster.

                          LOKI

                          (LAUGHS)
           No, you brought the monster.

                          NATASHA
           (turns back around; poised)
           So, Banner... that's your play.

                          LOKI

                          (STAGGERED)
           What?

                          NATASHA

                          (ON EARPIECE)
           Loki means to unleash the Hulk. Keep
           Banner in the lab, I'm on my way. Send
           Thor as well.

                          (TO LOKI)
           Thank you for your cooperation.
          Natasha quickly walks out, leaving Loki frozen.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Fury walks in SURPRISED to see Tony and Banner stop working on
          the scepter.

                          NICK FURY

                          (ANGRY)
           What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

                          TONY
           Uh...kind of been wondering the same
           thing about you.

                          NICK FURY
           You're supposed to be locating the
           Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           We are. The model's locked and we're
           sweeping for the signature now. When we
           get a hit, we'll have the location
           within half a mile.

                          TONY
           And you'll get your cube back, no muss,
           no fuss.
           (suddenly his monitor show a
           collection of SECRET FILES)
           What is PHASE 2?
          Suddenly, Steve drops a HYDRA ASSAULT RIFLE on the table causing
          Fury, Banner and Tony to turn around. Cap looks pissed.

                          STEVE
           PHASE 2 is SHIELD uses the cube to make
           weapons.

                          (TO TONY)
           Sorry, the computer was moving a little
           slow.

                          NICK FURY
           (trying to explain)
           Rogers, we gathered everything related
           to the Tesseract. This does not mean
           that we're...

                          TONY
           I'm sorry, Nick.
          Tony moves the computer screen towards Fury which shows plans of

          THE WEAPONS.

                          TONY
           What were you lying?

                          STEVE
           I was wrong, director. The world hasn't
           changed a bit.
          At that moment, Thor and Natasha walk into the lab. Natasha
          keeps her eyes right on Banner. Banner looks at her, PISSED.

                          BANNER
           Did you know about this?

                          NATASHA
           You wanna think about removing yourself
           from this environment, doctor?

                          BANNER
           I was in Calcutta, I was pretty well
           removed.

                          NATASHA
           Loki's manipulating you.

                          BANNER
           And you've been doing what exactly?

                          NATASHA
           You didn't come here because I bat my
           eyelashes at you.

                          BANNER
           Yes, and I'm not leaving because
           suddenly you get a little twitchy. I'd
           like to know why SHIELD is using the
           Tesseract to build weapons of mass
           destruction.

                          NICK FURY
           Because of him.
           (pointing at Thor)

                          THOR

                          (STUNNED)
           Me?

                          NICK FURY
          Last year earth had a visitor from
          another planet who had a grudge match
          that leveled a small town. We learned
          that not only are we not alone, but we
          are hopelessly, hilariously, outgunned.

                          THOR
          My people want nothing but peace with
          your planet.

                          NICK FURY
          But you're not the only people out
          there, are you? And, you're not the
          only threat. The world's filling up
          with people who can't be matched, they
          can't be controlled.

                          STEVE
          Like you controlled the cube?

                          THOR
          You're work with the Tesseract is what
          drew Loki to it, and his allies. It is
          the signal to all the realms that the
          earth is ready for a higher form of
          war.

                          STEVE
          A higher form?

                          NICK FURY
          You forced our hand. We had to come up
          with something.

                          TONY
          Nuclear deterrent. `Cause that always
          calms everything right down.

                          NICK FURY
          Remind me again how you made your
          fortune, Stark?

                          STEVE TONY
          I'm sure if he still made Wait! Wait! Hold on! How is
          weapons, Stark would be neck this now about me?
          deep... I'm sorry, isn't THOR
          everything?
           I thought humans were more
           evolved than this.

                          NICK FURY
           Excuse me, did WE come to YOUR planet
           and blow stuff up?

                          THOR
           Did you always give your champions such
           mistrust?

                          NATASHA BANNER
          Are you all really that Captain America is on
          naive? S.H.I.E.L.D monitors potential threat potential
          threats? watch list?

                          TONY STEVE
           (to Steve) I swear to God, Stark, one
          You're on that list? Are you more crack...
          above or below angry bees?
          Threatening! I feel
          threatened!
          As the "team" argues, they don't realize the BLUE GEM on Loki's
          scepter is glowing brightly.

          INT. AIRCRAFT CARRIER  DAY

          Outside the HELICARRIER, a lone carrier slowly hovers over the
          ship.

           SHIELD BASE VOICE
           661 Bravo, please relay your pass code.
           What is your hull, over?

                          BARTON
           Arms to ammunition, over.
          Inside, BARTON and his crew suit up and arm themselves. Barton
          pulls out his hi-tech bow and arrows.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Back in the lab, the egos of these people keeping rubbing off
          each other and at any moment, the shit will hit the fan.

                          THOR
           You speak of control, yet you court
           chaos.

                          BANNER
           It's his M.O., isn't it? I mean, what
           are we, a team? No, no, no. We're a
           chemical mixture that makes chaos.
           We're... we're a time-bomb.

                          NICK FURY
           You need to step away.

                          TONY
           (puts his arm around Steve)
           Why shouldn't the guy let off a little
           steam?

                          STEVE
           (pushes Tony off)
           You know damn well why! Back off!

                          TONY
           (comes face-to-face with Cap)
           Oh, I'm starting to want you to make
           me.

                          STEVE
           Big man in a suit of armor. Take that
           off, what are you?

                          TONY
           Genius, billionaire, playboy,
           philanthropist.

                          STEVE
           I know guys with none of that worth ten
           of you. Yeah, I've seen the footage.

                          (MORE)

                          STEVE (CONT'D)
           The only thing you really fight for is
           yourself. You're not the guy to make
           the sacrifice play, to lay down on a
           wire and let the other guy crawl over
           you.

                          TONY
           I think I would just cut the wire.

                          STEVE

                          (SMILING)
           Always a way out... You know, you may
           not be a threat, but you better stop
           pretending to be a hero.

                          TONY
           (that did it)
           A hero? Like you? You're a lab rat,
           Rogers. Everything special about you
           came out of a bottle!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The ramp of the carrier opens. The carrier maneuvers next to one
          of the large turbine engines. Barton stands at the base, holding
          out his bow. He pulls out a GRENADE TIPPED ARROW. He points
          right at the engine.
          Then...Barton moves his AIM and points the arrow about a hundred
          feet from the engine. He releases. The arrow flies out,but then
          SHARPLY heads for the engine. The arrow is punctured onto the
          engine. It has a visible timer which is COUNTING DOWN.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Back in the lab, Steve puffs up his chest at Tony, who just
          stands there, unmoving.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's go a few rounds.
          Thor laughs at them.

                          THOR
           You people are so petty... and tiny.
          Tony rubs his head. Moves away from Cap.

                          BANNER
           Yeah, this is a tee...

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Romanoff, would you escort
           Dr.Banner back to his...

                          BANNER
           Where? You rented my room.

                          NICK FURY
           The cell was just in case...

                          BANNER
           In case you needed to kill me, but you
           can't! I know! I tried!

                          (A BEAT)
           I got low. I didn't see an end, so I
           put a bullet in my mouth and the other
           guy spit it out! So I moved on. I
           focused on helping other people. I was
           good, until you dragged me back into
           this freak show and put everyone here
           at risk!
          Banner slowly gets upset as he looks at Romanoff, who gets
          unnerved.

                          BANNER
           You wanna know my secret, Agent
           Romanoff? You wanna know how I stay
           calm?
          BLACK WIDOW and Fury have their hands down to grab their guns.

                          STEVE
           Doctor Banner... put down the scepter.

          BANNER LOOKS DOWN AND IS SHOCKED TO SEE HE'S HOLDING LOKI'S
          SCEPTER. The computer beeps. They all turn to it.

                          TONY
           Got it.
          Banner puts down the scepter and walks over to the computer.

                          BANNER
           Sorry, kids. You don't get to see my
           little party trick after all.

                          THOR
           Located the Tesseract?

                          TONY
           I can get there faster.

                          STEVE
           Look, all of us...

                          THOR
           The Tesseract belongs on Asgard, no
           human is a match for it.
          Tony turns to leave, but Steve stops him.

                          STEVE
           You're not going alone!

                          TONY
           You gonna stop me?

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit, let's find out.

                          TONY
           I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit.
          At that moment Banner who's looking at the monitor notices
          something about the Tesseract.

                          BANNER
           Oh, my God!

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          Barton PULLS THE TRIGGER ON HIS BOW. The arrow then EXPLODES THE

          ENGINE RIGHT OFF THE HELICARRIER!

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING

          Everyone is thrown in every direction. Steve, Fury, Thor and
          Tony are thrown across while Natasha and Banner is down in the
          lower equipment room. Steve looks up at Tony.

                          STEVE
           Put on the suit!

                          TONY
           Yep!
          Steve helps Tony up and out of the lab. Fury sits up, clutching
          his ribs. He puts on his EARPIECE.

                          NICK FURY
           Hill?!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          PANDEMONIUM ERUPTS. Emergency alarms set off, fire extinguishers
          activate near surrounding fires and every agent is in a spinning
          scramble for their positions and armaments. Agent Hill keeps the
          bridge as calm as possible.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Turn up that engine! Number 3 engine is
           down! Can we get a run in?
           (runs over to GALAGA PLAYER)
           Talk to me.

                          GALAGA PLAYER
           (points to monitor)
           Turbine's loose. Mostly intact, but
           it's impossible to get out there and
           make repairs while we're in the air.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           We lose one more engine, we won't be.
           Somebody's got to get inside and patch
           that engine.

          INT. BANNER'S LAB  MORNING


                          NICK FURY
           Stark! You copy that?!

           TONY (V.O.)
           I'm on it!

                          NICK FURY
           Coulson! Initiate official lock down in
           the detention section then get to the
           armory! Move out!

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Agent Coulson runs out of the bridge.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  MORNING

          Natasha looks over to Banner, who is breathing heavy, having
          landed hard. He is gripping the grated floor to maintain
          control, but his eyes are green, his face intense.

                          NATASHA (CONT'D)
           (quietly, to herself)
           I'm okay. We're okay, right?

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

          Barton leads his men into the air ducts of the ship. They rappel
          down into a corridor.

                          BARTON
           Get that engine down! Detention! Get
           him through the dark! Come with me.
          Two of his men follow him. They head towards the bridge.

          EXT. ND HALLWAY, CARRIER  MORNING

          Tony and Cap run through a dim, debris filled hall.

                          TONY
           Find engine three. I'll meet you there.
          Cap peels off as Tony approaches a tech room. Inside, Tony's
          IRON MAN suit stands waiting, lit above in all its glory.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  CONTINUOUS

          ON BANNER'S FACE in the dim light as he struggles to suppress
          the rage, but his face is growing, changing slowly.
          Natasha is pulling herself painfully free, talking to Banner...

                          NATASHA
           Doctor... Bruce, you gotta fight it.
           This is just what Loki wants. We're
           gonna be okay. Listen to me.
          Two approaching SHIELD soldiers arrive to check on her. She
          furiously WAVES them away. They bolt out of there.

                          NATASHA
           We're gonna be okay. Right? I swear on
           my life I will get you out of this, you
           will walk away, and never...

                          BANNER
           Your life?
          His voice has the change in it -- the bitter amusement is
          morphing to a growled threat. Another explosion rocks the
          carrier -- and he turns to look at her, transforming just as the
          lights go out.

                          NATASHA

                          (PLEADING)
           Bruce.
          Banner suddenly starts transforming into the HULK and gives
          Natasha one last knowing look. Natasha STRUGGLES FREE of the
          rubble. She stops.
          The HULK, sensing her, turns his head and puts on a face of a
          disturb monster. Natasha JOLTS up the stairs with the HULK
          chasing after her. Natasha maneuvers like a black widow should.
          She rolls under a turbine, starts to crawl within the maze of
          pipes. The HULK pulls them out from above the catwalk.
          Natasha falls through under the catwalks and quickly and
          stealthily escapes. The HULK lets out a ROAR OF RAGE unlike
          anything. PRIMAL. Not human.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Loki looks up, smiling mischievously.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury RUNS in and sees the chaos has increased even more than
          before. The HELMSMAN is in complete disarray.

                          NICK FURY
           Bring the carrier inwards and head
           south. Take us to the water.

                          HELMSMAN
           Why water? Navigations recalibrated
           after the engine failure.

                          NICK FURY
           Is the sun coming up?!

                          HELMSMAN
           Yes, sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Then put it on the left! Get us over
           water! One more turbine goes down and
           we drop.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA, pushing with all his strength the door to
          portside, sees SHIELD tech in full oxygen masks shoot fire
          extinguishers and cover from sparks -- largely unable to do
          anything.
          Engine 3 is totally dead. A LARGE CHUNK of the port side in TORN

          OFF.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, I'm here!

                          TONY
           Good. See what we got.
          Tony flies in his IRON MAN suit and gets close to the damaged
          engine.

          INSIDE THE SUIT
          Tony observes within his viewscreen at the damaged engine and
          its layouts.

                          TONY
           I gotta get this super conducting
           cooling system back online before I can
           access the rotors and work on
           dislodging the debris.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN begins PULLING on the stuck rotors. Looks over atSteve.

                          IRON MAN
           I need you to get to that engine
           control panel and tell me which relays
           are in overload position.
          IRON MAN flies into giant cooling conductors. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          JUMPS over to the other side of the broken railing. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA gets himself to the control panel and opens it up. For a
          man who grew up as a YANK, what the fuck is this!

                          IRON MAN
           What's it look like in there?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           It seems to run on some form of
           electricity.

                          IRON MAN
           Well, you're not wrong.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Natasha continuously crawls under the catwalk. She stops.
          Then...BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. The room vibrates. Rhythmically.
          Natasha pulls out her gun and slowly walks out onto the catwalk
          and spins.
          ...and then a ROAR. THE HULK. Natasha FIRES a shot into a liquid
          nitrogen pipe that hits the hulk in face. The HULK SMASHES THE
          SHIT OUT OF IT. Natasha begins to run through the maze of
          corridors. The sound the monster is coming.
          Finally, she reaches and a long corridor. As she runs, behind
          her, the HULK TEARS up the hallway, coming at her.
          Natasha turns to see, but the HULK SLAPS her into the wall,

          SMASHING INTO THE GROUND.
          The HULK marks his territory. Natasha looks up. A fear she has
          never felt begins to seep out. The HULK raises his hand and IS
          KNOCKED OFF HIS FEET BY THOR WHO TACKLES HIM INTO the next room.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  CONTINUOUS

          Both Thor and HULK roll across the floor. Every person runs the
          hell out. Thor looks up at this magnificent beast. The HULK
          stands up and moving like a boxer, wants Thor to make his move.
          The HULK makes his move.
          SWING AND A MISS. Thor swings his massive hand and almost knocks
          HULK off his feet. HULK keeps swinging and missing, pissing him
          off. Finally, he brings down his arm, but Thor grabs it and
          wraps around it.

                          THOR
           We are not your enemies, Banner! Try to
           think!
          HULK lifts his arm up, to Thor's surprise, and he SENDS HIM

          FLYING AS HE PUNCHES THOR'S FACE WITH HIS FIST.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN continuously BLASTS broken debris off the turbine
          engine. It's bad, but still fixable.

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           The relays are intact. What's our next
           move?

                          TONY
           Even if I clear the rotors, this thing
           won't re-engage without a jump. I'm
           gonna have to get in there and push.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Well if that thing gets up to speed,
           you'll get shredded!

                          TONY
           Then stay in the control unit and
           reverse polarity long enough to
           disengage mag...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Speak English!

                          TONY
           See that red lever? It'll slow the
           rotors down long enough for me to get
           out. Stand by it, wait for my word.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA looks over at the other side where he was. He
          sees the red lever and JUMPS towards it.

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

          Thor CRASHES into another stack of crates. As he raises his
          head, he feels something on his lips. BLOOD. As he swipes it
          off, the ROAR of the HULK is not too far. Thor extends his hand
          out.
          The ROAR gets LOUDER and CLOSER. Thor focuses. His hand strains
          toward mid-air. His eyes tight in concentration. The HULK runs
          right at him. At the last second, MJ�LNIR flies into his hand
          and Thor UPPERCUTS HULK, WHO CRASHES INTO A FIGHTER JET.
          HULK stands up, shaking his head like `what the fuck just
          happened.' He SHAKES it off and ANGRILY rips off the TAIL of the
          jet, TORQUES HIS BODY LIKE A GREEK DISCUS THROWER AND... HURLS

          THE MASSIVE PLATE AT THOR.
          Thor SLIDES and DUCKS under the tail. Jumping up, he throws
          Mj�lnir with all his strength, knocking the HULK head over
          heels. HULK falls down, hammer in hand. HE tries to lift it, but
          can't. Mj�lnir rests atop his hand.
          Struggle as he may, HULK wraps his hand around the hammer. The
          hammer doesn't move. To no avail -- he strains with all his
          might, SCREAMS from the effort, BELLOWING.
          Thor jumps up again, KNEEING HULK in the face. Thor grabs his
          hammer, jumps on him, using the hammer as a lock for his
          CHOKEHOLD. Hulk tries to pull him off.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill look over their monitors.

                          NICK FURY
           We need a full evac on the lower hangar
           bay.
          Agent Hill nods. She leaves to exit out, but a SLIDING GRENADE
          appears.

           AGENT MARIA HILL

           GRENADE!
          The grenade goes off, sending her down the steps. Fury FIRES a
          shot at the open entrance. He moves over behind the side of the
          entrance. A handful of Barton's men enter. Watchful, ready,
          waiting... Fury steps out, his GUN drawn.
          A SHOOT OUT and HAND-TO-HAND ensues, but Fury is unable to stop
          one of them, which is why he is shot in the head by Agent Hill,
          who looks hot and sexy holding her gun.

          INT. HELICARRIER ARMORY SECTION  DAY

          Agent Coulson walks up the armory door. He places his head into

          INT. HELICARRIER AIRCRAFT PORT  DAY

          HULK CRASHES from under the floor, sending Thor on his ass. HULK
          grabs him by the neck.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          A gunfight opens up. AGENTS exchange fire with brutally
          efficient tactical soldiers.

          A SHOWER OF BULLETS SPRAYS THE HULK EVERYWHERE. Thor ducks for
          cover. The HULK turns around, letting out his PRIMAL ROAR. He
          jumps up, TAKES A RUNNING START AND LEAPS...

          ESCORT 606 PILOT LOOKS LIKE HE TOOK A SHIT.

                          ESCORT 606 PILOT

          HULK LANDS ON THE JET'S NOSE. THE JET SPINS WILDLY. As the HULK

          THE HULK CATCHES HIM, WAVES HIM AROUND AND THEN THROWS HIM AWAY.
          ESCORT 606 PILOT pulls his parachute. THE JET EXPLODES. THE HULK

          PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG.

          IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS
          on it, relieving the rotors.
          On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN
          AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as
          they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with
          Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as
          throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word
          for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing
          down at them.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and
          are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming.

                          NICK FURY
           They are not getting through here, so
           what the hell...
          Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES
          critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards
          Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB

          OUTLETS.
          Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self-
          activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every
          single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to
          shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT
          to one side.

           AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.)
           Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1.

                          NICK FURY
           It's Barton. He took out our systems.

          IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots.

                          IRON MAN
           Yeah. Noticed.
          The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S
          BOOSTERS get more and more bright.
          On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at
          Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA
          loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto
          a LOOSE CABLE.

          Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki,
          escaping.

                          THOR

           NO!
          Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES
          down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki
          dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind
          the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki
          smiles.

           Are you ever not going to fall for
           that?

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move,
          Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand
          fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making
          Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJ�LNIR onto the glass cell. To
          his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES
          the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING

          SOLDIER.

                          LOKI
           (smiles; walks over to the

                          CONTROL PANEL)
           The humans think us immortal. Should we
           test that?
          Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON
          stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Move away, please.
          Loki moves away from the switch.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You like this? We started working on
           the prototype after you sent THE
           DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it
           does. Do you wanna find out?

          A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE

          REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON.

                          THOR
           Nooo!
          Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps
          down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch.
          He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful.
          Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND

          DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP.

          INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER  DAY

          Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha
          KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at
          her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN.
          Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to
          SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a
          LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his
          wrist. Barton lets go of the knife.
          Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm
          LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes
          down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses.

                          BARTON
           Natasha...
          Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

          EXT. SKY

          Thor, trapped in the glass cage, BOUNCES off the JUMBLING cell
          pod. As it draws closer to land, Thor tries to swing at glass,
          but misses. Land draws closer.
          In a final attempt before crashing, Thor positions himself onto
          the glass door and LEAPFROGS just as the cage is about to hit
          the ground. The cell CRASHES into the shore as Thor crashes out
          into the meadow.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Loki has no remorse as he looks down. He closes the hatch and
          proceeds to leave. A WEAK VOICE.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You're gonna lose.

                          LOKI

                          (TURNING)
           Am I?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's in your nature.

                          LOKI
           Your heroes are scattered, your
           floating fortress falls from the
           sky...where is my disadvantage?

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           You lack conviction.

                          LOKI
           I don't think I...

          AGENT COULSON SHOOTS LOKI WITH HIS PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE,

          CAUSING LOKI TO BE BLOWN THROUGH THE WALL BEHIND HIM.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           So that's what it does.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN that the hatch
          has been open. Knowing Agent Coulson was sent there, he goes to.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          IRON MAN continuously SPINS Engine 3, giving it all he has. THE
          ROTORS ARE PROPELLING PROPERLY AND FAST. The HELICARRIER LEVELS
          itself.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Cap, I need the lever!

           STEVE (V.O.)
           I need a minute here!

                          TONY
           Lever. Now!
          Tony lets go of the rotors. They spin by themselves. Tony is
          then caught in one. He is now fucked. IRON MAN slips into the
          rotors, getting chewed up.

          EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA CLIMBS up the loose cable and reaches the
          railing.
          BARTON'S MAN opens fire once more. CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls himself
          up and finally PULLS the lever.
          A VENT opens up from Engine 3. IRON MAN falls out, but the suit
          heavily damaged, hardly keeping him up. IRON MAN heads for Cap.
          BARTON'S MAN turns his AIM to IRON MAN, who TACKLES him into the
          wall. IRON MAN rolls over, tired. Cap lets out a sigh of relief.

          OUTSIDE THE HELICARRIER
          The carrier that brought Barton and his team now leaves, taking
          Loki and his scepter. The carrier flies into the distance.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Fury runs in finding Agent Coulson still alive, barely.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           Sorry, boss. They got rabbited.

                          NICK FURY
           Just stay awake. EYES ON ME!

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           No. I'm clocked out here.

                          NICK FURY
           Not an option.

           AGENT PHIL COULSON
           It's okay, boss. This was never going
           to work... if they didn't have
           something... to...
          Agent Coulson looks away. Sighs his last breath. Nick Fury looks
          on grimly at Coulson. The medical team arrives.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY


           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           Agent Coulson is down.
          Agent Hill is being treated for a gash on her head, listens on
          her headset, standing up.

           SHIELD AGENT (V.O.)
           Paramedics are on their way.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They're here.

          INT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE  DAY

          Steve and Tony listen in as well.

           NICK FURY (V.O.)
           They called it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  LATER

          Fury gathers Tony and Steve back into the briefing room everyone
          there has a look as if in a daze. A look of numb shock is shown
          on their devastated faces.

                          NICK FURY
           These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.
           Guess he never did get you to sign
           them.
          Fury throws Coulson's CAPTAIN AMERICA TRADING CARDS on the table
          towards Steve. Steve picks them up, STAINED WITH BLOOD.

                          NICK FURY
           We're dead in the air up here. Our
           communications, location of the cube,
           Banner, Thor. I got nothing for you.
           Lost my one good eye. Maybe I had that
           coming.

                          (A BEAT)
           Yes, we were going to build an arsenal
           with the Tesseract. I never put all my
           chips on that number though, because I
           was playing something even riskier.
           There was an idea, Stark knows this,
           called THE AVENGERS INITIATIVE. The
           idea was to bring together a group of
           remarkable people, see if they could
           become something more. See if they
           could work together when we needed them
           to, to fight the battles that we never
           could. Phil Coulson died still
           believing in that idea, in heroes.
          Tony gets up and walks off, not wanting to hear it anymore.

                          NICK FURY
           Well, it's an old fashioned notion.

          EXT. MEADOW  DAY

          Thor walks out far into the meadow. He looks down. MJ�LNIR.

          INT. ABANDONED BUILDING  DAY

          Banner wakes up, in human form. He looks around and sees he is
          IN A PILE OF RUBBLE and looks up at the OPEN CEILING HE CRASHED
          IN. AND IS COMPLETELY NAKED. A SECURITY GUARD stands there,
          amazed.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           You fell out of the sky.

                          BANNER

                          (COMING TO)
           Did I hurt anybody?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           There's nobody around here to get hurt.
           You did scare the hell out of some
           pigeons though.

                          BANNER
           Lucky.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Or just good aim. You were awake when
           you fell.

                          BANNER
           You saw?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           The whole thing, right through the
           ceiling. Big and green and buck ass
           nude. Here...
          He throws Banner a pair of big pants. Banner pulls on his pants.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           I didn't think those would fit you
           until you shrunk down to a regular size
           fella.

                          BANNER
           Thank you.
          A beat.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Are you an alien?

                          BANNER
           What?

                          SECURITY GUARD
           From outer space, an alien?

                          BANNER
           No.

                          SECURITY GUARD
           Well then, son, you've got a condition.

          INT. HELICARRIER MEDICAL ROOM  DAY

          Barton is strapped down. Natasha watches over him as Barton
          tries to shake off Loki's mind control.

                          NATASHA
           Clint, you're gonna be alright.

                          CLINT BARTON
           You know that? Is that what you know? I
           got...I gotta go in though. I gotta
           flush him out.

                          NATASHA
           We don't have that long, it's gonna
           take time.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I don't understand. Have you ever had
           someone take your brain and play? Pull
           you out and send something else in? Do
           you know what it's like to be unmade?

                          NATASHA
          You know that I do.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Why am I back? How did you get him out?

                          NATASHA
          Cognitive recalibration. I hit you
          really hard in the head.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Thanks.
           (Natasha unfastens the

                          RESTRAINTS)
          Tasha, how many agents?

                          NATASHA
          Don't. Don't do that to yourself,
          Clint. This is Loki. This is monsters
          and magic and nothing we were ever
          trained for.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Loki, he got away?

                          NATASHA
          Yeah. I don't suppose you know where?

                          CLINT BARTON
          I didn't need to know. I didn't ask.
          He's gonna make his play soon though.
          Today.

                          NATASHA
          We gotta stop him.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Yeah? Who's we?

                          NATASHA
          I don't know. Whoever's left.

                          CLINT BARTON
          Well, if I put an arrow in Loki's
          eyesocket, I'd sleep better I suppose.

                          NATASHA
          Now you sound like you.
          Natasha sits next to her partner and friend.

                          CLINT BARTON
           But you don't. You're a spy, not a
           soldier. Now you want to wade into a
           war. Why? What did Loki do to you?

                          NATASHA
           He didn't, I just...

                          (SHE PAUSES)

                          CLINT BARTON
           Natasha.

                          NATASHA
           I've been compromised. I got red in my
           ledger. I'd like to wipe it out.

          INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION  DAY

          Tony look at the empty cell container. He stands not saying a
          word. Steve walks in.

                          STEVE
           Was he married?

                          TONY
           No. There was a uh...cellist, I think.

                          STEVE
           I'm sorry. He seemed like a good man.

                          TONY
           He was an idiot.

                          STEVE
           Why? For believing?

                          TONY
           For taking on Loki alone.

                          STEVE
           He was doing his job.

                          TONY
           He was out of his league. He should
           have waited. He should have...

                          STEVE
          Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

                          TONY

                          (WALKS AWAY)
          Right. How did that work for him?

                          STEVE
          Is this the first time you've lost a
          soldier?

                          TONY
           (turns around sharply)
          WE ARE NOT SOLDIERS! I am not marching
          to Fury's fife!

                          STEVE
          Neither am I! He's got the same blood
          on his hands as Loki does. Right now
          we've got to put that aside and get
          this done. Now Loki needs a power
          source, if we can put together a
          list...

                          TONY
           (looking at the blood stained

                          WALL)
          He made it personal.

                          STEVE
          That's not the point.

                          TONY
          That is the point. That's Loki's point.
          He hit us all right where we live. Why?

                          STEVE
          To tear us apart.

                          TONY
          He had to conquer his greed, but he
          knows he has to take us out to win,
          right? That's what he wants. He wants
          to beat us and he wants to be seen
          doing it. He wants an audience.

                          STEVE
           Right, I caught his act at Stuttengard.

                          TONY
           Yeah. That's just a preview, this is
           opening night. Loki's a full-tilt diva.
           He wants flowers, he wants parades, he
           wants a monument built in the skies
           with his name plastered...

          Steve walks in full uniform. Natasha looks at him, unprepared.

                          STEVE
           Time to go.

                          NATASHA
           Go where?

                          STEVE
           I'll tell you on the way. Can you fly
           one of those jets?
          Barton walks out of the restroom. Looks at Cap.

                          CLINT BARTON
           I can.
          Steve looks at Natasha and she nods her head to confirm Barton's
          on their side.

                          STEVE
           You got a suit?

                          CLINT BARTON
           Yeah.

                          STEVE
           Then suit up.

                         MONTAGE
          - KRAKAKABOOM! A blinding BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from
          above, colliding on MJ�LNIR. The explosion is massive. THE

          MIGHTY THOR.
          - CAPTAIN AMERICA pulls on his HELMET and SHIELD.
          - Tony WELDS his IRON MAN helmet. LIGHT slips down over IRON
          MAN's eye holes.
          - BLACK WIDOW attaches a GLOVE GAUNTLET with her rounds on her
          wrist. A BLUE LIGHT CHARGES.
          - HAWKEYE slips on his QUIVER of arrows.

          EXT/INT. QUINJET  DAY

          Cap, Widow and Hawkeye walk towards and into the QUINJET. A
          YOUNG SHIELD PILOT looks and stands in their way.

           YOUNG SHIELD PILOT
           You are not authorized to be here...

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Son... just don't.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury looks the window of the ship, contemplating. Agent Hill
          walks up to him, knowing.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir.

                          NICK FURY
           Agent Hill?

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Those cards, they were in Coulson's
           locker, not in his jacket.

                          NICK FURY
           They needed the push.
           (holding Coulson's cards)
          A LOUD NOISE SCREECHES. Fury looks out to see IRON MAN flying
          off as well as the QUINJET.

                          NICK FURY
           They found it. Get our communications
           back up, whatever you have to do. I
           want eyes on everything.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Yes, sir.

          EXT. NEW YORK CITY SKYLINE - STARK TOWER  DAY

          IRON MAN arrives at STARK TOWER where Selvig, ACTIVATES the CMS
          device, holding the Tesseract.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, I took off the arc reactor. The
           device is already self-sustained.

                          TONY
           Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

                          SELVIG
           It's too late! It can't stop now. He
           wants to show us something! A new
           universe.

                          IRON MAN
           Okay.
          IRON MAN aims his hands toward the CMS and FIRES. The energy
          from his boosters SHATTERS with a deafening CRACK! Selvig falls
          backwards. DOWN BELOW, CITIZENS OF NEW YORK look up at STARK
          TOWER. IRON MAN stares in disbelief at the CMS ... unharmed.

                          JARVIS
           The barrier is pure energy. It's
           unbreachable. The Mark VII is not ready
           to be deployed.

                          TONY
           Skip the spinning rims. We're on the
           clock.
          TONY lands his SUIT and goes through the gauntlet and unsuits
          him. LOKI looks up at him, smiling. They proceed to walk into
          the penthouse.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          Loki walks in, holding the scepter. Tony casually walks down the
          steps, towards the bar.

                          LOKI
           Please tell me you're going to appeal
           to my humanity.

                          TONY
           Uh...actually, I'm planning to threaten
           you.

                          LOKI
           You should have left your armor on for
           that.

                          TONY
           Yeah, it's seen a bit of mileage.
           You've got the blue stick of destiny.
           Would you like a drink?

                          LOKI
           Stalling me won't change anything.

                          TONY
           No, no, no! Threatening. No drink? You
           sure? I'm having one.

                          LOKI
           The CHITAURI are coming, nothing will
           change that. What have I to fear?

                          TONY

           THE AVENGERS.
           (Loki looks at him, confused)
           It's what we call ourselves, sort of
           like a team. `EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES'
           type of thing.

                          LOKI
           Yes, I've met them.

                          TONY

                          (SMILING)
           Yeah, takes us a while to get any
           traction, I'll give you that one.

                          TONY (CONT'D)
           But, let's do a head count here. Your
           brother, the demi-God; a super soldier,
           a living legend who kind of lives up to
           the legend; a man with breath-taking
           anger management issues; a couple of
           master assassins, and you, big fella,
           you've managed to piss off every single
           one of them.

                          LOKI
           That was the plan.

                          TONY
           Not a great plan. When they come, and
           they will, they'll come for you.
          From underneath the bar table, Tony pulls on COLANTOTTE
          BRACELETS, a honing device.

                          LOKI
           I have an army.

                          TONY
           We have a HULK.

                          LOKI
           I thought the beast had wandered off.

                          TONY
           You're missing the point. There's no
           throne, there is no version of this,
           where you come out on top. Maybe your
           army comes and maybe it's too much for
           us, but it's all on you. Because if we
           can't protect the Earth, you can be
           damned well sure we'll avenge it.

                          LOKI
           (slowly walks up to him;
           raising the scepter)
           How will your friends have time for
           me,when they're so busy fighting you?
          Loki TAPS Tony on the chest with his scepter. PING! Nothing.
          Confused, Loki tires again. PING! NOTHING.

                          LOKI
           It should work.

                          TONY
           Well, performance issues. You know?
          In anger, Loki GRABS Tony by the throat and FLINGS him across
          the room.

                          TONY
           Jarvis. Anytime now.
          Loki grabs Tony by the throat again.

                          LOKI
           You will all fall before me.
          LOKI THROWS TONY OUT THE WINDOW. Tony FREEFALLS down the tower.
          From behind Loki, an elevator opens and a RED POD SHOOTS out.
          The pod LASER SIGNALS the COLANTOTTE BRACELETS on Tony. The POD
          begins to TRANSFORM into the MARK VII suit.
          It LATCHES onto Tony. IRON MAN. The suit FLIES up before he hits
          the ground or the gazing people. Loki looks up, angry.

                          IRON MAN
           And there's one other person you pissed
           off! His name was Phil.
          Loki raises the scepter. IRON MAN FIRES at Loki, sending him on
          his ass.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Selvig looks up at the sky. The Tesseract's energy BEAMS into
          the sky. The beam then forms a VORTEX, which then opens up

          ANOTHER PORTAL.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          A hole in space rips open, and from it, the CHITAURI ARMY SPILLS
          out in FLYING CHARIOTS, carrying ENERGY RIFLES with a bayonet on
          the end.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Right. Army.
          IRON MAN flies up towards the portal. From his shoulders, a
          miniature multiple rocket launcher, pops out and FIRES. Like the
          JERICHO MISSILE, several targets are taken down unlike no
          missile. It's useless. THOUSANDS OF CHITAURI FLY OUT. IRON MAN
          flies towards the city.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The CHITAURI UNLEASH. New Yorkers fill the streets, staring at
          the fire fight in the distance. BOOM!!! The CHITAURI unleashes
          BLASTS as it goes, blowing up cars, setting storefronts aflame.

          AN EXPLOSION RIPS OUT THE WINDOWS OF THE TOP CORNER OF

          BUILDINGS. FLAME AND STONE RAIN DOWN. A DOMINO-EFFECT OF

          EXPLOSIONS RIPPLING ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Loki walks onto the balcony as the SOUNDS of the CHITAURI rings
          out. He admires his soon to be kingdom. THOR LANDS ON THE TOWER.
          Loki turns to his ENEMY.

                          THOR
           Loki! Turn off the Tesseract or I'll
           destroy it!

                          LOKI
           You can't. There is no stopping it.
           There is only the war!

                          THOR
           So be it.
          Loki and Thor rush at each other. They and their weapons
          collide. The two battle -- Loki unleashing another pent-up rage
          and jealousy, Thor having no choice but to defend himself.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          SOLDIERS AND COPS have taken positions covering the streets.
          They see from the sky, IRON MAN leading a trail of CHITAURI
          towards his tower.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          The QUINJET BOOMS into the city.

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Stark, we're heading north east.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          IRON MAN
           What, did you stop for drive-thru?
           Swing up PARK, I'm gonna lay 'em out
           for you.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          IRON MAN BANKS around his tower. Sees Thor and Loki still going
          at it. IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street, causing a CHITAURI to
          crash.
          Flying up, IRON MAN puts the following CHITAURI in view of the
          QUINJET. BLACK WIDOW takes out machine gun and FIRES at the

          CHITAURI.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we have more incoming.

                          TONY
           Fine. Let's keep them occupied.
          IRON MAN heads back to the portal.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Thor and Loki battle savagely. Loki fires ENERGY from the
          scepter, sending Thor sliding across the floor.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          HAWKEYE looks out to his left window, finding a target.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           See them.
          HAWKEYE BANKS the jet towards STARK TOWER. Aims the MINIGUN at
          Loki. Loki AIMS the scepter at the QUINJET and FIRES A BLAST OF
          ENERGY. Thor gets to his feet, TACKLING Loki down hard.
          THE QUINJET is soon caught on fire. HAWKEYE maneuvers one wing
          of the jet. They SPIN and SLOW. DROPPING OUT OF THE AIR AS IT
          PASSES OVER SKYSCRAPERS. Then... they SLAM into the street.

          INT. QUINJET  DAY

          With everyone okay, HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW unfasten their
          seatbelts and open the ramp. CAPTAIN AMERICA runs down, followed
          by HAWKEYE and BLACK WIDOW. Each one has their respected weapons
          in hand.

          EXT. FOUR WAY STREET  DAY

          The TRIO arrives in the middle of a four-way street. Suddenly,
          the city LURCHES to a stop. A DEEP, PRIMAL RAGE BELLOWS OUT.
          With that roar, a SHADOW comes over them.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, a FUCKING CHITAURI LEVIATHAN FLIES OUT!
          Carrying hundreds of SOLDIERS, the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN PASSES
          OVER the TRIO.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          They look up, out of their element. From both sides, CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS CLING OFF and attach themselves to the sides of the
          buildings, sliding down. Some CRASH into these buildings and
          begin FIRING from their ENERGY RIFLES at innocent people.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, are you seeing this?

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I'm seeing, still working on believing.
           Where's Banner? Has he shown up yet?

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          TONY
           Just keep me posted. Jarvis, find me a
           soft spot.
          IRON MAN quietly flies behind and parallel with the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Thor holds down Loki's face straight ahead, forcing him to watch
          the city falling to ash.

                          THOR
           Look at this! Look around you! You
           think this madness will end with your
           rule?

                          LOKI
           (tries to look away)
           It's too late. It's too late to stopit.

                          THOR
           No. We can. Together.
          Loki looks at his brother, showing a sign of hope. Then... Loki
          stabs Thor with a small knife. Thor keels over.

                          LOKI
           Sentiment.
          Thor gets up, KICKS Loki and lifts him into the air. Thor then
          SLAMS him down, hard. Loki, bleeding, rolls over the edge. Thor
          looks down. LOKI IS RIDING ON A FLYING CHARIOT. DOZENS of
          CHITAURI follow his lead.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          The TRIO runs behind upside taxis. They look up and see Loki
          taking his band down the street and FIRES at the street IN A

          CHAIN OF EXPLOSIONS. SMASHING CARS AND HURLING PEOPLE AS IT GOES

          IT GOES OFF IN ONE FINAL CONFLAGRATION.
          TERRIFIED PEOPLE running from Loki, looking over their
          shoulders, coming straight at us. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down the
          bridge.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Those people need assistance down
           there.
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS that have landed near them and begin FIRING at
          them. BLACK WIDOW pulls both pistols and FIRES. Turns to Cap.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           We got this. It's good. Go!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (AT HAWKEYE)
           You think you can hold them off?

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain.
           (pulls a trigger on his bow;
           a narrow is mechanically

                          CHOSEN)
           It would be my genuine pleasure.
          HAWKEYE shoots an ARROW into the creature's head, gaining a few
          seconds for CAPTAIN AMERICA as he falls down the bridge,
          followed by an EXPLOSION.
          Cap races over to the plaza, jumping over dozens of EXPLODING
          cars. THE FIRST AVENGER RUNS LIKE A FUCKING CHEETAH.
          HAWKEYE runs over a bus full of people. From the windows, SMALL
          CHILDREN are held by their parents for HAWKEYE to pull them out
          to safety. He runs over to the jammed door and JERKILY opens it.
          People begin to run out.
          BLACK WIDOW empties out her CLIPS. HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the
          ranks of the CHITAURI, hitting his mark each time he shoots.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Just like BUDAPEST all over again!

                          HAWKEYE
           You and I remember Budapest
           verydifferently.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The COPS continuously fire at the flying chariots. It's pretty
          pointless. A YOUNG COP runs over to his POLICE SERGEANT.

                          YOUNG COP
           We need to get out! They gotta bring
           the National Guard!

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           National Guard? Does the army know
           what's happening here?

                          YOUNG COP
           Do we?
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps in front of them. They look up at this
          ridiculous looking man.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I need men in these buildings. There
           are people inside that can run into the
           line of fire. You take them through the
           basement or through the subway. You
           keep them off the streets. I need a
           perimeter as far back as 39th.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           Why the hell should I take orders from
           you?
          Suddenly, an EXPLOSION comes up from behind Cap. An ENERGY BLAST
          is blocked by his SHIELD. TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS attack. The cops
          watch in shock as CAPTAIN AMERICA FIGHTS them off with ease. The
          Sergeant turns to his officer.

                          POLICE SERGEANT
           I need men in those buildings, lead the
           people down and away from the streets.
           I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

          EXT. SKY LINE  DAY

          IRON MAN swerves around a building and faces the CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN. He pulls out his miniature multiple rocket launcher
          and FIRES. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN ROARS in annoyance. The
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN turns to him.

                          IRON MAN

                          (TO JARVIS)
           We got his attention. What the hell is
           step two?!
          IRON MAN flies away.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          HAWKEYE TRIPS a CHITAURI SOLDIER and RAMS an arrow down its
          throat. BLACK WIDOW gets her hands on an ENERGY RIFLE and
          STICKFIGHTS the hell out of them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA joins back in and using his SHIELD, SWAPS and
          WHACKS oncoming CHITAURI SOLDIERS. It's all too much on them,
          until...
          Lightning strikes down from the sky, channeling the blast,
          firing the electricity out at the CHITAURI SOLDIERS around them.
          They're blasted back in a massive shockwave. The CHITAURI
          SOLDIERS convulse, drop dead to the ground. THOR TOUCHES DOWN.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What's the story upstairs?

                          THOR
           The powers surrounding the cube is
           impenetrable.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Thor is right. We gotta deal with these
           guys.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           How do we do this?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           As a team.

                          THOR
           I have unfinished business with Loki.

                          HAWKEYE
           Yeah, get in line.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Save it. Loki's gonna keep this fight
           focused on us and that's what we need.
           Without him these things could run
           wild. We got Stark up top, he's gonna
           need us...
          Just then, BANNER ARRIVES ON A SMALL MOTORBIKE. Getting off, he
          looks around the city.

                          BANNER
           So, this all seems horrible.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I've seen worse.

                          BANNER
           Sorry.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           No. We could use a little worse.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark? We got him.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           Banner?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Just like you said.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Then tell him to suit up. I'm bringing
           the party to you.
          IRON MAN comes out from behind a building. The CHITAURI
          LEVIATHAN follows, impatiently.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          The rest of the AVENGERS look up, getting ready and standing
          still.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I... I don't see how that's a party...
          IRON MAN SWOOPS down the street. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN also
          swoops down, BARRELING down the street like a FREIGHT TRAIN that
          keeps building and building its intensity.Banner looks behind.
          Cap looks at him. Banner begins to walk towards the monster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Dr. Banner. Now might be a really good
           time for you to get angry.

                          BANNER
           That's my secret, Captain. I'm always
           angry.
          Banner's body starts to swell and stretch and harden. GREEN

          SHOOTS THROUGH HIS BODY. THE HULK.
          Aaaannndddd.........SSSMMMAAASSSHHH!!!! HULK POPS the CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN IN THE NOSE. THE CREATURE FLIPS OVER A 360.
          IRON MAN, in mid-flight, extends his arm out and a ROCKET, ready
          to shoot. IRON MAN FIRES -- the rocket hits a SOFT SPOT  LARGE
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN are BLOWN COMPLETELY AWAY. Real pain from the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Other pieces of meat CATCH FIRE and
          withdraw... SIZZLE as they hit the pavement. CAPTAIN AMERICA
          raises his SHIELD to block them.
          From above and on the buildings, the CHITAURI ARMY watches in
          horror as a group of EARTH'S MIGHTIEST HEROES FIND THEMSELVES

          UNITED AGAINST A COMMON THREAT. TO FIGHT THE FOES NO SINGLE

          SUPER HERO COULD WITHSTAND! THE AVENGERS ASSEMBLE!

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          Loki watches below, motionless.

                          LOKI
           Send the rest.

          EXT. VASTNESS OF SPACE

          From the portal, THOUSANDS MORE OF CHITAURI SOLDIERS AND EVEN

          MORE CHITAURI LEVIATHANS FLY OUT!

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          THE AVENGERS look up. Way out of their fucking element.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Guys.

                          IRON MAN
           Call it, Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Alright, listen up. Until we can close
           that portal up there, we're gonna use
           containment. Barton, I want you on that
           roof, eyes on everything. Call out
           patterns and strays. Stark, you got the
           perimeter. Anything gets more than
           three blocks out, you turn it back or
           your turn it to ash.

                          HAWKEYE
           Wanna give me a lift?

                          IRON MAN
           Right. Better clench up, LEGOLAS.
          IRON MAN lifts HAWKEYE up to the building.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Thor, you've gotta try and bottleneck
           that portal. Slow them down. You've got
           the lightning. Light the bastards up.
           (Thor flies up; to Natasha)
           You and me, we stay here on the ground,
           keep the fighting here. And Hulk.SMASH.

          THE HULK SMILES A MOST MAGNIFICENT GRIN AND LEAPS, SOARING HIGH

          UP INTO THE NEAREST BUILDING, HULK RUNS UP THE WALL HITS SEVERAL

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS, SNAPPING IN HALF.

          HE DIVES TOWARDS A BUILDING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREET,
          THROWING THE DEAD CHITAURI SOLDIERS TOWARDS OTHER SOLDIERS. The
          CHITAURI SOLDIERS fire at him. THE HULK BACKHANDS THEM, SEIZES

          THEM AND WITH RAW POWER, THROWS THEM DOWN.

          IN HIS MOST POWERFUL LEAP YET, THE HULK FLIES UP AND IS IN THE

          MIDDLE OF A FLYING CHARIOT TRAFFIC JAM, TO WHICH HE SMACKS THEM

          OUT OF ALTITUDE.

          EXT. EMPIRE STATE BUILDING  DAY

          Thor grabs onto the tower. Raises MJ�LNIR and KRAKAKABOOM! A
          BLINDING BOLT OF LIGHTNING strikes down from above, colliding on

          MJ�LNIR. THOR AIMS THIS MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE TOWARDS THE PORTAL.

          THOR CHANNELS THE BLAST AND FIRES THE ELECTRICITY OUT AT THE

          CHITAURI SOLDIERS FLYING OUT OF THE PORTAL. THEY'RE BLASTED BACK

          IN A MASSIVE SHOCKWAVE. THE CHITAURI SOLDIERS CONVULSE, DROP

          DEAD TO THE GROUND. HE EVEN RIPS THE SHIT OUT OF A CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN, WHICH THEN FUCKING EXPLODES.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the destruction
          going on in NEW YORK. Agent Hill walks up to him.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir. The council is on.
          OH SHIT. Fury presses his screen.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          Atop the rooftop, HAWKEYE fires ARROWS into the streaming flow
          of the CHITAURI RIDERS, hitting his mark each time. Hell, heeven
          AIMS his bow behind him, WITHOUT LOOKING and releases the arrow,
          EXPLODING a RIDER.

                          HAWKEYE
           Stark. You got a lot of strings
           sticking to your tail.

                          IRON MAN
           Just try and keep them off the streets.

                          HAWKEYE
           Well, they can't bank worth a damn.
           Find a tight corner.

                          IRON MAN
           I will roger that.
          IRON MAN does so and leads towards TIGHT CORNERS and in
          HAWKEYE'S view, who fires arrow upon and arrow, EXPLODING the
          CHITAURI RIDERS. IRON MAN keeps leading CHITAURI RIDERS UNDER
          TUNNELS, THROUGH OPEN PARKING GARAGES. He looks back. None left.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           Nice call. What else you got?

           HAWKEYE (V.O.)
           Well, Thor's taking on a squadron down
           on 6th.

                          TONY
           And he didn't invite me?

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

          We are looking INTO a conference room where office workers sit
          around a table. But the NOISE has caught one worker's eye, then
          another, and soon they are all rising, stepping to the window,
          mesmerized by what lies beyond.
          WORKERS' POVA CHITAURI LEVIATHAN SWIMS right in front of them.

          EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - CONFERENCE ROOM  DAY

          Suddenly, another NOISE catches the worker's attention. THE HULK

          CRASHES THROUGH THEIR FLOOR. SLASHES HIS THROUGH THE ROOM,

          POUNDING AWAY AND JUMPS OUT ONTO THE JAW OF THE CHITAURI

          LEVIATHAN. THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN BEGINS TO HEAD DOWN, TRYING TO

          WAVE OFF THE HULK.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, using the ENERGY RIFLE, is taken off her feet by a
          CHITAURI SOLDIER. She TIRESOMELY takes it down by cutting its
          throat. She grabs the ENERGY RIFLE, turns to attack. Cap stands
          there, holding his SHIELD. She slumps back, tired.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Captain, none of this is gonna mean a
           damn thing if we don't close that
           portal.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Well, maybe it's not about guns.
           (gestures the flying

                          CHARIOTS)

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           You wanna get up there, you're gonna
           need a ride.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I got a ride. I could use a lift
           though.
          BLACK WIDOW backs up giving herself a running start. Cap lifts
          and angles his SHIELD.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Are you sure about this?

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

          BLACK WIDOW RUNS AT CAPTAIN AMERICA. BLACK WIDOW DOES A PARKOUR

          MOVE, USING HER FEET TO RUN UP THE CAR AND JUMPS UP ON CAP'S

          SHIELD, WHO GIVES HER A BOOST WITH THE SHIELD. SHE GRABS ONTO A

          FLYING CHARIOT.
          [Note: The following sequence will take us through the action in
          one extended shot.]
          - BLACK WIDOW climbs onto the chariot and CUTS the turret
          shooter's linkage to it. She then JUMPS on the rider and STICKS
          her knives into his nervous system. She gets him to BANK over a
          building.
          - IRON MAN arrives and SHOOTS any other CHITAURI RIDERS
          following her. He makes his way down to CAPTAIN AMERICA, who
          fights off more CHITAURI SOLDIERS. IRON MAN points his HAND
          BOOSTERS at his SHIELD. The energy comes off and Cap uses it as
          a REFLECTION BEAM and takes down nearby CHITAURI.
          - From above them, HAWKEYE sends down remaining arrows. He sends
          one across the street, taking down a CHITAURI RIDER following

          IRON MAN.
          - Finally, we have THOR and HULK fight on top the back of the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, tearing apart and fighting SOLDIERS. HULK

          BREAKS OFF A MASSIVE PIECE OF ARMOR AND SLAMS IT DOWN ONTO THE
          SPINE OF THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN. Summoning all his strength he,

          THOR RAISES, DRAWING LIGHTNING TO IT FROM ALL SIDES, AND BRINGS

          IT DOWN WITH A FINAL, TERRIBLE BLOW--

          INT. HISTORY MUSEUM  DAY

          The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN CRASHES into a history museum. DEAD. THOR
          and HULK stand on the BACK of the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN after
          bringing it down. They stand still, admiring. HULK PUNCHES THOR

          WITH HIS ENORMOUS HAND. THOR GOES FLYING. HULK SMIRKS.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          SELVIG WAKES UP FROM LOKI MIND CONTROL. He looks around,
          confused where he is. He looks up at the sky, amazed.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          Several HUMVEES aim their MOUNTED .50 Cal guns into the sky,
          FIRING and HITTING CHITAURI RIDERS. CAPTAIN AMERICA fights off a
          SOLDIER who is pinning him down with its energy rifle. Cap
          BREAKS ITS LEG. He stands up, pickingup his SHILED.

                          HAWKEYE
           Captain, the bank on 42ndpast MADISON,
           they caught a lot of civilians there.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           I'm on it.

          INT. 42NDBANK  DAY

          Dozens of civilians are gathered in bank. Tension and
          uncertainty surround them. THREE CHITAURI SOLDIERS oversee them,
          pointing their weapons at them. One of them charges a BOMB. It

          BEEPS.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps through the window and throws his SHIELD
          at the CHITAURI BOMBER. The TWO CHITAURI SOLDIERS aim their
          rifles, but Cap heads for cover under a desk, which he KICKS at
          them.
          CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps over the desk, HEADLOCKS A SOLDIER, while
          BACKHANDING another one over the railing. The crowd moves away.
          A CHITAURI SOLDIER attacks him from behind and RIPS OFF HIS
          HELMET. The bomb is beeping faster.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Everyone! Clear out!
          CAPTAIN AMERICA flips over the SOLDIER, grabs his SHIELD and
          just as the BOMB is about to GO OFF, CHITAURI BOMBER dives for,
          trying to stop it, but it GOES OFF, sending CAPTAIN AMERICA
          through the window, landing very hard on a car. The civilians
          look up from below. They're okay.

          EXT. OUTSIDE THE BANK  CONTINUOUS

          Cap gets off the car, looks around the city. Destroyed. The
          police and firemen arrive, pulling out those civilians he saved.
          A WAITRESS looks back, thankful.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Fury sees on his VIEWSCREEN the WORLD

          SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           Director Fury, the council has made a
           decision.

                          NICK FURY
           I recognize the council has made a
           decision, but given that it's a stupid
           ass decision, I've elected to ignore
           it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Director, you're closer than any of
           oursubs, you scramble that jet...

                          NICK FURY
           That is the island of Manhattan,
           Councilman. Until I'm certain my team
           can't hold it, I will not order a
           nuclear strike against a civilian
           population.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           If we don't hold them in the air, we
           lose everything.

                          NICK FURY
           I send that bird out, we already have.
          Fury shuts off his viewscreen.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW, still driving the chariot with the RIDER, is hit at
          her side. She looks about, wondering whose ENERGY FIRE it was
          she looks behind.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Oh. You.
          LOKI FOLLOWS IN HOT PURSUIT. They RACE DOWNWARD, trailing
          between buildings. They RACE MADLY, driving and dodging.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          HAWKEYE looks at BLACK WIDOW, astonished.

                          HAWKEYE
           Nat, what are you doing?

           BLACK WIDOW (V.O.)
           Uh... a little help!
          HAWKEYE pulls the trigger twice, nocks an arrow, and points it
          at Loki, smiling.

                          HAWKEYE
           I've got him.

          FIRES. THE ARROW STREAKS DOWN THE CITY, STRAIGHT AT THE LOKI'S

          HEAD...

          SNATCH! LIKE A CAT, LOKI GRABS THE ARROW STRAIGHT OUT OF THE

          AIR...LOOKS STRAIGHT AT HAWKEYE, SMILING...

          BBOOOOMMM!!! THE ARROW EXPLODES IN LOKI'S FACE, CRASHING INTO

          THE STARK PENTHOUSE PAD.
          BLACK WIDOW looks down and building her momentum, she JUMPS of
          the chariot, lands on top of STARK TOWER, rolling herself to the
          edge.

          EXT/INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          As Loki looks up, shocked at what just happened, THE HULK IS
          LEAPING UP AND KICKS LOKI, HURTLING TOWARDS THE GLASS WINDOW. He
          COLLAPSES as he hits the wall. THE HULK jumps in, ready to
          attack. Loki ROLLS himself up in a flurry of broken glass,

          STANDING UP TO THE HULK.

                          LOKI

           ENOUGH! YOU ARE, ALL OF YOU ARE BENEATH

           ME! I AM A GOD, YOU DULL CREATURE, AND

           I WILL NOT BE BULLIED...

          HULK GRABS LOKI BY THE LEGS AND SMASHES HIM AGAINST THE FLOOR

          REPEATEDLY AND FINALLY THROWS HIM ASIDE TO THE GROUND,

          FLATTENING LOKI.

                          HULK

           PUNY GOD.

          LOKI WHIMPERS IN PAIN.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          BLACK WIDOW walks up the CMS machine. Selvig, slumped down,
          weakened, looks at her desperately. The Tesseract's energy is
          firing towards the portal, gaining in strength, at the surge of
          energy moving through the sky.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Doctor.

                          SELVIG
           Loki's scepter, the energy...the
           Tesseract can't fight. You can't
           protect against yourself.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           It's not your fault. You didn't know
           what you were doing.

                          SELVIG
           Well, actually I think I did. I built
           in a safety to cut the power source.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Loki's scepter.

                          SELVIG
           It might be able to close the portal.
           (Selvig looks down. He sees a

                          GOLD GLEAM)
           And I'm looking right at it.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          THOR rides on top of chariot, SMACKING SEVERAL RIDERS with the
          hammer. As Thor takes the reins, a CHITAURI LEVIATHAN crashes
          through a building, knocking him down to where Cap is, fighting
          off SOLDIERS.
          IRON MAN flies right next to the CHITAURI LEVIATHAN and aims his
          LASER BOOSTER at it. Nothing.

                          JARVIS
           Sir, we will lose power before you cut
           through that shell.
          IRON MAN flies up ahead, facing the oncoming monster.

                          IRON MAN
           JARVIS. You ever hear the tale of
           Jonah?

                          JARVIS
           I wouldn't consider him a role model.

          IRON MAN FLIES TOWARDS THE CHITAURI LEVIATHAN, UNLEASHING EVERY
          ARSENAL ON THE SUIT. The CHITAURI LEVIATHAN opens its mouth.
          IRON MAN flies in and BURSTS out the other end, making the
          CHITAURI LEVIATHAN collapse. IRON MAN rolls down the street. The
          wind is knocked out of him. He looks up with an overwhelming
          sigh as a SMALL BAND of CHITAURI SOLDIERS rush towards him,
          holding out their rifles.

          EXT. ROOFTOP BUILDING  DAY

          HAWKEYE turns to fire HIS LAST ARROW. Using his bow as a staff,
          he knocks some CHITAURI SOLDIERS, before yanking his last arrow
          off the dead body a CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          HAWKEYE nocks his arrow, DIVES DOWN THE BUILDING and FIRES his
          GRAPPLING ARROW up into the side of building. Falling down,
          HAWKEYE finds the MOMENTUM and SWINGS himself into a building
          and CANNONBALLS in.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          The HULK holds CHITAURI SOLDIERS by the face and SLAMS them
          down. More keep coming. HULK looks up. HUNDREDS OF RIDERS HOVER
          OVER HIM. Then... they begin to fire ENERGY BLASTS. HULK TAKES

          THEM LIKE HE'S RUNNING THROUGH A LIGHT RAIN. BLOCKING THE STREAM

          OF STREAKING BLASTS, AS THOUGH SWATTING AT BEES.

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY

          A lone pilot sits in his cockpit, listening.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           DIRECTOR FURY is no longer in command.
           Override order, 7 ALPHA 11.

                          7 ALPHA 11 PILOT
           7 ALPHA 11, confirmed. Prepare to
           takeoff.
          He ignites his engine.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, Agent Hill sees on her SCREEN 7 ALPHA 11
          preparing to leave.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, we have a bird in motion! Anyone
           on the deck, we have a rogue bird! We
           need to shut it down! Repeat! Take off
           is not authorized!

          EXT. HELICARRIER DECK  DAY


          NICK FURY RUNS OUT TO THE DECK, HOLDING A FUCKING AIRTRONIC RPG-
          7. He takes AIM and FIRES, HITTING the TAIL END of the jet. The
          jet SKIDS OFF towards the edge. PILOT UNHARMED.
          Suddenly, another 7 ALPHA 11 JET FLIES off. Fury stands there,
          knowing he can't do anything about it.

                          NICK FURY
           Stark, you hearing me? We have a
           missile headed straight for the city.

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           How long?

                          NICK FURY
           Three minutes, at best. Stay low and
           wipe out the missile.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          IRON MAN fights off as many CHITAURI SOLDIERS as he sustain.

                          IRON MAN
           Jarvis, put everything we got into the
           thrusters!

                          JARVIS
           I just did.
          IRON MAN leaves the streets and flies up into the sky.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          7 ALPHA 11 arrives outside the city. He flips the switch to
          press the button. He presses it. THE MISSILE IS FLYING OUT TO

          MANHATTAN.

                          7 ALPHA 11
           Destination is in 2 minutes, 30 seconds
           mark.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          CAPTAIN AMERICA AND THOR BATTLE, SIDE TO SIDE. Cap and Thor both
          throw their respected weapons. Thor catches MJ�LNIR, but as Cap
          turns, an ENERGY BLAST strikes him down hard. Thor runs over to
          a broken car, swings the hammer and flips the car over and over
          on its side, crushing a few CHITAURI SOLDIERS.
          Cap tries to get up. Thor helps him back to his feet. Cap raises
          his SHIELD back up.

                          THOR
           You ready for another bout?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           What? You gettin' sleepy?

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Selvig, back in scientist mode, CLACKS away at his laptop.
          Henods. BLACK WIDOW grabs Loki's scepter, slowly breaks into the
          FORCE FIELD, almost touching the Tesseract.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           I can close it! Can anybody hear me? I
           can shut the portal down!

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Do it!

           IRON MAN (V.O.)
           No, wait!

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           Stark, these things are still coming!

          INSIDE THE SUIT

                          TONY
           I got a nuke coming in, it's gonna blow
           in less than a minute. And I know just
           where to put it.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          IRON MAN catches up, now comes at the missile from behind. The
          missile speeds on. IRON MAN grabs it from behind, gripping it
          tightly.
          With a mighty effort, he wrenches the rocket off its course.
          Steering it from behind, he accelerates quickly, flying straight
          up into sky, towards the portal.

          INSIDE THE SUIT

           CAPTAIN AMERICA (V.O.)
           Stark, you know that's a one-way trip?

                          TONY

                          (TO JARVIS)
           Save the rest for return, J.

                          JARVIS
           Sir. Shall I call Miss Potts?

                          IRON MAN
           You might as well.

          INT. STARK JET  DAY

          PEPPER, along with her crew, watches on T.V., in horror, the
          destruction in NEW YORK. On the table, her cell is VIBRATING,
          with Tony's picture on it.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Back in the bridge, every single agent holds their breath as
          they too watch IRON MAN fly up into the portal.

          EXT. SKY  DAY

          IRON MAN climbs higher and higher over the city, gaining speed,
          suddenly flings himself through the portal. Communications die.
          The suit begins to freeze. Tony looks in horror.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Every single agent CHEERS. Fury smiles. He tries to communicate
          with Tony. NOTHING.

          EXT. SPACE

          We then see Tony's horror. AN ARMADA. The black sky is filled
          with what must be ninety ships in a vague cluster. Most of them
          hang still in the air. Some move swimmingly about.
          IRON MAN lets go of the missile. It whistles off into the
          blackness as IRON MAN IDLY falls back down the portal's opening.
          The missile reaches the MAIN SHIP. The MAIN SHIP IMPLODES,
          causing the entire ARMADA to burst into a supernova, creating a
          spectacular heavenly display.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          Suddenly, all of the CHITAURI SOLDIERS and CHITAURI LEVIATHANS
          KEEL OVER and begin to SHAKE, then stop. They all fall over. THE
          AVENGERS look up at their CONSULTANT, not sure if he'll make it
          through.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Still holding the scepter in hand, BLACK WIDOW shifts around,
          waiting.

                          BLACK WIDOW
           Come on, Stark...

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY

          Thor and Cap see the supernova coming towards them. Thor nods to
          Cap.

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA
           (to BLACK WIDOW)
           Close it.

          EXT. STARK TOWER  DAY

          Without hesitating, BLACK WIDOW pulls the scepter out, the
          TESSERACT turns off its energy beam. The PORTAL QUICKLY CLOSES.
          A SMALL FIGURE is hurled backwards into the open now closed
          portal. IRON MAN. Plummeting to the earth.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY


                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (SMILING)
           Son of a gun!
          TIGHT ON IRON MAN: He keeps falling. And falling. And falling.

          EXT. MANHATTAN  DAY


                          THOR
           He's not slowing down.
          Thor swings Mj�lnir around. Just as Thor flies up, THE HULK

          SNAGS IRON MAN OUT OF THE AIR, BOTH CRASHING AND SLIDING DOWN A

          BUILDING.

          EXT. BRIDGE STREET  DAY

          HULK throws IRON MAN off him. Thor and Cap run over to him. Thor
          RIPS off Tony's helmet. He appears to be dead. They stand around
          not sure. Then... THE HULK YELLS IN FURY. THE NOISE STARTLES

          TONY AWAKE.

                          TONY
           What the hell? What just happened?
           Please tell me nobody kissed me?

                          CAPTAIN AMERICA

                          (A BEAT)
           We won.

                          TONY
           Alright. Hey. Alright. Good job, guys.
           Let's just not come in tomorrow. Let's
           just take a day. Have you ever tried
           shawarma? There's a shawarma joint
           about two blocks from here. I don't
           know what it is, but I wanna try it.

                          THOR
           (looking up at Stark Tower)
           We're not finished yet.
          A beat.

                          TONY
           And then shawarma after.

          INT. STARK PENTHOUSE  DAY

          Loki crawls onto the stair, looking like a piece of shit rag
          doll. He takes a few breathers, senses someone is behind him. He
          turns TO FIND THE AVENGERS STARING AT HIM, PISSED.

                          LOKI
           If it's all the same to you. I'll have
           that drink.

          THE HULK SNORTS AT HIM.

          WEEKS LATER.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  DAY

          In TV news montage about THE AVENGERS, we see various reports of
          what happened. Some people agree that the avengers did good,
          protecting the city. Others believe it was their cause.

           OLD MAN (STAN LEE)
           Superheroes? In New York? Give me a
           break!

                          SENATOR BOYNTON
           These so called heroes have to be held
           responsible for the destruction done to
           the city. This was their fight. Where
           are they now?

                          WAITRESS
           What? That this was somehow their
           fault? Captain America saved my life.
           Wherever he is, wherever any of them
           are, I just wanna say thank you.

          EXT. CENTRAL PARK  DAY

          The Avengers take Thor and Loki, who is handcuffed and muzzled,
          to a blocked area. Thor shakes hands with his team and gives
          Selvig a hug. Tony opens the Tesseract's case.
          Banner takes it out and places inside a glass tube, held by
          Thor. Thor gives Loki the other end, who reluctantly takes it.
          The Asgardians leap into the energy beam. GONE.
          Then, one-by-one, the group splinters off, strolling into
          different directions. Banner climbs in with Tony in his
          sportscar. Steve rides away in his Harley. Natasha and Clint
          climb back into SHIELD cars. They all part. For now.

          INT. SHIELD ANALYTICAL ROOM  DAY

          Fury is facing once more members of the WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #3
           Where are the Avengers?

                          NICK FURY
           I'm not currently tracking their
           whereabouts. I'd say they've earned a
           leave of absence.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #2
           And the Tesseract?

                          NICK FURY
           The Tesseract is where it belongs: out
           of our reach.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           That's not your call.

                          NICK FURY
           I didn't make it. I just didn't argue
           with the god that did.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           So you let him take it and the war
           criminal, Loki, who should be answering
           for his crimes?

                          NICK FURY
           Oh, I think he will be.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           I don't think you understand what
           you've started. Letting the Avengers
           loose on this world. They're dangerous.

                          NICK FURY
           They surely are. And the whole world
           knows it. Every world knows it.

           WORLD SECURITY COUNCIL #1
           Was that the point of all this? A
           statement?

                          NICK FURY
           A promise.

          Fury walks out, towards the bridge.

          INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE  DAY

          Fury and Agent Hill walk together, toward the window looking out
          into the world.

                         AGENT MARIA HILL
           Sir, how does it work now? They've gone
           their separate ways, some pretty
           extremely far. We get into a situation
           like this again, what happens then?

                          NICK FURY
           They'll come back.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           You really sure about that?

                          NICK FURY
           I am.

           AGENT MARIA HILL
           Why?

                          NICK FURY
           Because we'll need them to.

          Agent Hill turns around. Fury looks out, smiling.
