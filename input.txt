EXT. BARTON HOME - DAY CLOSE ON: A HOUSE-ARREST ANKLE BRACELET. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) Okay, you see where you’re going? Let’s work on how to get there. Pan up to find...CLINT BARTON, with his daughter, LILA, coaching her as she notches an arrow in her bow. CLINT BARTON
 (CONT'D) Okay, good...tip down...bow arm out...three fingers LILA BARTON  Why three? CLINT BARTON ‘Cause two’s not enough and four’s too muchLAURA BARTON (O.S.) You guys want mustard or mayo, or both? CLINT TURNS. IN THE FIELD BEHIND THEM, his wife, LAURA BARTON sets up a picnic as COOPER and NATHANIEL play soccer. LILA BARTON 
Who puts mayo on a hot dog? CLINT BARTON We’ll both have mustard, hon! (to Lila) Okay. Draw back, deep breath... She lets loose. THUD! HER ARROW HITS NEAR THE BULLS-EYE. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Good job, Hawkeye. Go get your arrow. LAURA BARTON (O.S.) Enough murder practice! Soup’s on!
CLINT BARTON One sec, babe. Be right there! We’re gonna kill some hot dogs. We’re hungry. But when he turns back...LILA IS GONE. The bow and arrow lie at his feet. He stares.  CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Lila? Babe, did you see LilaHe turns to his wife, BUT SHE’S GONE. So are the boys. The soccer ball rolls to a stop near the picnic blanket. NO ONE CAN BE SEEN FOR A HUNDRED YARDS IN ALL DIRECTIONS. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Guys? Guys, come on... Clint walks toward the field, dread growing. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) Laura? Clint breaks into a panicked run. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) LAURA! CLINT MELTS DOWN, SPINNING AROUND, FRANTIC... MARVEL FLIP EXT. SPACE - NIGHT BLACKNESS. TITLE: “TWENTY-TWO DAYS LATER.” Soon, THE BENATAR tumbles past, adrift... INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - NIGHT TONY STARK and NEBULA play table-top football. She wins. TONY (offering his hand) Good sport. Have fun? Nebula studies his hand, confused. Finally she shakes. NEBULA It was fun. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony, thin and haggard, kneels in front of HIS BROKEN IRON MAN HELMET. He hits a switch. A light blinks.   TONY’S RECORDING: he stares directly into the “camera.” TONY This thing on? Hey, Ms. Potts. Pep. If you find this recording, don’t post it on social media. It’s going to be a real tearjerker. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT THE BENATAR sparks, adrift. TONY (O.S.) I don’t know if you’re ever going to see these. I don’t even know if you’re still...God, I hope so. Today’s day twenty-one, no...twentytwo. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK NEBULA lasers shut Tony’s infected wound. TONY (O.S.) You know, if it wasn’t for the existential terror of staring into the literal void of space, I’d say I’m feeling a little better today. Infection’s run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. You’d like her. She’s very practical. And only a tiny bit sadistic. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK TONY AND NEBULA MEND THE EMPTY FUEL CELLS UNDER THE FLOOR. TONY (O.S.) The fuel cells were cracked during battle, but we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge. Bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. Problem is that was about...49 hours ago. EXT. SPACE - NIGHT FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE WATCH THE BENATAR DRIFT IN SPACE.   TONY (O.S.) Which means, we’re dead in the water. A thousand light years from the nearest 7-11. INT. BENATAR, GALLEY - FLASHBACK Tony hands Nebula the last of A PURPLE POWDER. She pushes it back to him. TONY (O.S.) Most of the quote-unquote ‘food’ and potable water ran out two weeks ago. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Tony stands on the flight deck, one hand resting on the glass, staring into the unknown. TONY Pep, I know I said no more surprises. But, I gotta say, I was really hoping to pull off one last one. But it looks like...well, you know what it looks like. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - NIGHT Back to now. Tony records his thoughts into his helmet. TONY Don’t feel bad about this. I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks, and then move on with enormous guilt...I should probably lie down for a minute, rest my eyes. Please know, when I drift off, it will be like every day lately. I’m fine, totally fine. I’m going to dream about you. It’s always you. Tony switches the helmet off. TIME CUT: NEBULA finds TONY SPRAWLED ON THE FLOOR. TIME CUT:   Nebula helps Tony into Quill’s chair. Tony slumps, completely still. Nebula gives him his privacy. Move in on Tony’s face as...A LIGHT SLOWLY GROWS BRIGHTER. Soon, the entire flight deck glows as bright as a sun. Nebula appears from the galley, shading her eyes. Tony’s eyelids flutter. Finally, he opens them to see... CAPTAIN MARVEL (CAROL DANVERS) hovering in space. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, BATHROOM - NIGHT STEVE ROGERS shaves. He studies himself in the mirror, exhausted. He’s about to tap his razor in the sink’s standing water, when... THE WATER RIPPLES. Steve stares a beat, puzzled. Then the lamp catches his eye...SWAYING GENTLY. Just then, a sound roars overhead. Steve turns... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - NIGHT THE MOON HANGS HUGE OVER THE EARTH. Then the silhouette of THE BENATAR races past, propelled by CAROL DANVERS. Below...STEVE ROGERS, BRUCE BANNER, AND NATASHA ROMANOV watch a flying woman guide the ship to the ground. Behind them, PEPPER POTTS walks up to the group. TIME CUT: Steve races up as NEBULA helps Tony down the ramp. TONY I couldn’t stop him. STEVE Neither could we. TONY I lost the kid. STEVE (unable to say it all) We...lost... TONY Is Pepper...?   JUST THEN, PEPPER POTTS THROWS HERSELF INTO TONY’S ARMS. PEPPER POTTS Stay here, you stay right hereTONY I’m not going anywhere. NEARBY, NEBULA watches the sad humans. ROCKET SITS BESIDE HER, GRATEFUL. She rests a hand on his furry head. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY RHODEY, TONY, STEVE, NATASHA, AND CAROL watch... A HOLO-DISPLAY ROTATING THROUGH FACES OF PEOPLE WE’VE LOST: WANDA. VISION. BUCKY. T’CHALLA. MARIA HILL. RHODEY It’s been twenty-three days since Thanos came to Earth. TONY, weak, sits in a hi-tech wheelchair, IV dripping into his arm. He stares, taking in the loss: SAM WILSON. SECRETARY ROSS. SHARON CARTER. SCOTT LANG. HOPE VAN DYNE. HANK PYM. NICK FURY. At Fury, Carol bites back emotion. NATASHA World governments are in pieces, as you can imagine. But the parts that still work are trying to take a census. It looks like he did what he said he was going to do. JANE FOSTER. ERIK SELVIG. WONG. DR. STRANGE. THE BARTON FAMILY. QUILL. DRAX. MANTIS. GROOT. PETER PARKER. Finally, Tony looks away. RHODEY turns it off. NATASHA (CONT'D) Thanos wiped out fifty percent of all the living creatures on Earth. CAROL DANVERS Not just Earth. RHODEY You sure about that?   CAROL DANVERS You never have to ask me that. TONY Where is he now? STEVE We don’t know. He just opened a portal and walked through. Tony looks out to see...THOR on the patio. TONY What’s his deal? ROCKET (O.S.) He’s pissed. Tony turns to see Rocket for the first time. ROCKET (CONT'D) He thinks he failed. Which, of course, he did. But there’s a lot of that going around, ain’t there? TONY Until this second, I literally thought you were a Build-a-Bear. STEVE We’ve been hunting Thanos for three weeks - deep space scans, satellites - we got nothing. Tony, you fought himTONY Who told you that? I didn’t fight him, he wiped my face with a planet while a Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. There was no fight because he’s not beatable. STEVE Did he give you anything to go on? Clues, coordinatesTony stares, lost, barely acknowledging Steve. TONY I saw this coming, few years back. Didn’t wanna believe. I thought I was dreaming...   STEVE Tony, I need you to focusTONY And I needed you, as in past tense. That trumps what you need. It’s too late, buddy. You know what I need? Tony turns to everyone, slightly unstable. TONY (CONT'D) I need a shave and a burger, not a bowl of soup. (stands) And I believe I remember telling all of you, alive and otherwise, that we needed a suit of armor around the world, whether it impacted our precious freedoms or notSTEVE But that didn’t work out, did it? TONY I said we’d lose, you said we’d “do that together, too.” Guess what, Cap, we lost, and you weren’t there. But that’s what we do, right? Our best work after the fact? We’re the “Avengers”, not the “Pre-vengers-” RHODEY Tony, take it easy... TONY I’ve got nothing for ya, Cap. No coordinates, no clues, no strategies, no options. Zero, zip, nada. No trust. (rips out RT) Here. You take this. You find him, you put this on, and hide. (drops to his knees) I’m fine! Tony COLLAPSES. Rhodey catches him.   INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CORRIDOR - DAY CAROL, STEVE, AND NATASHA stare through GLASS DOORS at TONY IN A HOSPITAL BED, PEPPER AND BANNER AT HIS SIDE. RHODEY STEPS OUT OF THE HOSPITAL ROOM. RHODEY Bruce gave him a sedative. Should be out the rest of the day. CAROL DANVERS (heading for the lab) Take care of him. When I come back, I’ll bring a bottle of Xorrian elixir. STEVE Where are you going? CAROL DANVERS To kill Thanos. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY NATASHA catches up to CAROL IN THE WORKSHOP. NATASHA Hey, hey, hang on. We’re sort of a team here. Between you and me, morale’s a little fragile. CAROL DANVERS Oh, I’m sorry. My fault. Carol sees Steve and Rhodey catch up. She claps her hands. CAROL DANVERS (CONT'D) All right, team! I’m going to go kill Thanos. Message me if you get any intel that can help. Otherwise, I’ll report back when he’s dead. Great work, everybody. STEVE Look, we realize “up there’s” more your territory, but this is our fight, too. RHODEY Do you even know where he is?   CAROL DANVERS I know people who mightNEBULA (O.S.) Don’t bother. They all turn to see NEBULA in THE LIVING AREA DOORWAY. NEBULA (CONT'D) I can tell you where Thanos is. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - DAY STEVE, NATASHA, RHODEY, BANNER, ROCKET, THOR, and CAROL gather. NEBULA studies her robotic hand. NEBULA Thanos spent a long time trying to...perfect me. When he worked, he talked. About his Great Plan. Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. I’d ask, where would we go once his plan was complete? His answer was always the same: “To the Garden.” RHODEY You’re saying Thanos had a retirement plan. STEVE Where’s this garden? ROCKET brings up EARTH on A HOLO-MAP. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY ENVELOPS THE PLANET (EMANATING FROM WAKANDA). ROCKET When Thanos snapped his fingers, Earth become ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. No one’s seen anything like it. He shifts the map, crossing billions of light years, to...AN IDENTICAL SURGE ENVELOPING A MYSTERIOUS, ORANGE PLANET. ROCKET (CONT'D) Until two days ago. NATASHA You’re saying he snapped his fingers again. Where?   Rocket zooms the holo-image toward a cluster of stars... NEBULA Planet is unnamed, but inhabitable. Rich atmosphere, good soilSTEVE A garden. BRUCE BANNER Thanos is there. And he just used the stones. Steve eyes everyone. THOR FINALLY LOOKS UP. BRUCE BANNER (CONT'D) (thinking of himself) You know, we’d be going shorthanded. RHODEY Because he killed all our friends. ROCKET Are we saying they’re dead? We’re using that word now? RHODEY He’s still got the stones. CAROL DANVERS So, we take them. And we use them to bring everybody back. BRUCE BANNER Just like that? STEVE Yeah. Just like that. No one speaks. Finally... NATASHA If there’s even the smallest chance we can undo this, then we owe it to everyone who’s not sitting here to try. Everyone looks around the room...AGREED. BRUCE BANNER If we do this...why would it end any differently than it did before?   CAROL DANVERS Because before you didn’t have me. RHODEY Hey, new girl. All of us in here are about that superhero life. Where’ve you been all this time? CAROL DANVERS There’s a lot of people in the universe. And they didn’t all have you. THOR STANDS. He crosses to Carol and holds out his hand. STORMBREAKER WHIPS PAST HER HEAD, RUFFLING HER HAIR. Carol doesn’t flinch. Thor smiles. THOR I like this one. Steve stares at the planet a long, deciding moment. Then... STEVE Let’s go get that son of a bitch. SLAM TO: TITLE: “AVENGERS: ENDGAME” INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - DAWN EVERYONE settles into their seats on the Benatar’s flight deck. STEVE WATCHES EARTH GROW SMALLER THROUGH THE WINDOW. CAROL DANVERS Trust me. You get used to it. ROCKET looks around from the pilot’s chair. ROCKET Okay, who here hasn’t been to space? STEVE, NATASHA, and RHODEY half-raise their hands. ROCKET (CONT'D) Oh, you’re gonna hate this. NEBULA Approaching jump in three, two... STEVE’S FINGERS TIGHTEN on the arm rest as...   EXT. BENATAR - DAWN WHOOSH! THE BENATAR WARPS, LEAPING INTO JUMP SPACE. EXT. SPACE - DAY WHOOSH! THE BENATAR ARRIVES ABOVE AN OMINOUS, ORANGE PLANET. As the ship maintains orbit, CAROL flies toward the planet. CAROL DANVERS I’ll head down for recon. If I’m not back in fifteen, you’ll know I found him. INT. BENATAR, FLIGHT DECK - SPACE OUR HEROES wait on the flight deck, tense. NATASHA looks at STEVE, who’s staring at...A COMPASS: PEGGY CARTER’S YELLOWED PHOTO STILL RESTS INSIDE. NATASHA This is going to work, Steve. STEVE I know it will. (beat) Because I don’t know what I’m going to do if it doesn’t. JUST THEN, CAROL FLIES UP TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLASS. CAROL DANVERS (OVER COM) No satellites, no ships, no armies. No ground defenses of any kind. It’s just him. NEBULA That’s enough. The Avengers exchange a look. EXT. TITAN-2 - DAY SMOKE CURLS FROM THE CHIMNEY OF A SOLITARY LODGE. INT. THANOS’ LODGE - DAY A POT BOILS OVER A FIRE. Then...THANOS LIMPS TOWARD IT, LEFT SIDE PARALYZED, arm blackened. A shell of his former self.   He stirs the pot. Suddenly, AN ARMORED HAND BURSTS FROM THE FIRE, GRABBING THANOS’ GAUNTLET... PREVENTING THANOS FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. Thanos jerks back as HULKBUSTER SPRINGS INSIDE. CAROL AND RHODEY BASH THROUGH THE ROOF, PINNING THANOS’ ARMS. THOR crashes through the door, followed by the others. HE SWINGS STORMBREAKER...CUTTING OFF THANOS’ HAND. The Gauntlet lands at Rocket’s feet. He picks it up...and his face goes slack. He turns the glove toward the others. And we now realize...THE INFINITY STONES ARE GONE. STEVE Where are they? Thanos doesn’t answer. CAROL PRESSES HIM TO HIS KNEES. CAROL DANVERS Answer the question! THANOS The universe required correction. After that, the stones served no purpose beyond temptation. BRUCE BANNER You murdered trillions. THANOS You should be grateful. NATASHA Where are the stones? THANOS Gone. Reduced to atoms. BRUCE BANNER You used them two days ago! THANOS I used the stones to destroy the stones. It nearly killed me. But the work is done. It always will be. That lands, sickening. ROCKET SEARCHES, FRANTIC, NEAR TEARS. ROCKET No...they can’t be gone...   RHODEY He’s lying. NEBULA My father is many things. A liar is not one of them. THANOS Thank you, daughter. Perhaps I’ve treated youSWOOSH. THOR’S AXE SEVERS THANOS’ HEAD FROM HIS BODY. IT HITS THE FLOOR, FOLLOWED BY THE THUD OF HIS HUGE FRAME. ROCKET What did you do? Thor just stares, his long journey a failure. THOR I went for the head. As Thor walks away, Steve looks at Thanos’ head on the ground. IT’S OVER. THEY LOST. FADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK: “FIVE YEARS LATER.” EXT. PORT OF NEW YORK - DAY A CAR CRUSHER flattens an Audi. THOUSANDS MORE NEVER-DRIVEN CARS LIE STACKED ON THE DOCKS, WAITING THEIR TURN. EXT. NEW YORK - DAY A HUGE TARP flaps over the shuttered LINCOLN CENTER. EXT. SHEA STADIUM - DAY A TEENAGE GIRL rides her skateboard, alone in a weed-filled parking lot. Pull back to see THE EMPTY STADIUM BEHIND HER. INT. BROOKLYN COMMUNITY CENTER - NIGHT A POSTER SHOWS A SINGLE FIGURE STARING AT A GROUP OF SHADOWS. IT READS, “WHERE DO WE GO, NOW THAT THEY’RE GONE?” The bottom reads, “BROOKLYN SUPPORT GROUP, TUESDAYS 8PM.”   A GRIEVING MAN speaks in A RECOVERY GROUP. GRIEVING MAN So, I went on a date the other day. JIMMY Good job, Bobby. Back in the game. GRIEVING MAN Thank you, Jimmy. (to the group) First in five years. I sat there at dinner thinking, what are we even supposed to talk about? STEVE ROGERS, thinner, older, LISTENS INTENTLY. STEVE What did you talk about? GRIEVING MAN Same old crap. How much things have changed. How much we miss the Mets. My job, his job. Then it got kind of quiet. He cried during the salads. OLDER MAN What about you? GRIEVING MAN I cried just before dessert. But I’m seeing him again tomorrow. So... STEVE That’s great. You’ve already done the hardest part. You took a jump, didn’t know where you’d come down. And that’s it, those little brave baby steps we’ve gotta take. To try to make us feel whole again, to find a purpose... (to everyone) I went into the ice right after I met the love of my life. Woke up seventy years later and...had to keep going. The group takes this in.   STEVE (CONT'D) The world’s been left in our hands. If we don’t do something with it...then Thanos might as well have killed all of us. People nod, but Steve seems unconvinced by his own words. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY THE CAMERA ROTATES down from the sky onto a strangely quiet San Francisco, until it finds...A STORAGE WAREHOUSE. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, UNIT 277 - DAY LUIS’ VAN sits in a storage unit, surrounded by boxes: “S. LANG, KITCHEN, S. LANG, CLOTHES.” THROUGH THE VAN WINDOWS, we see...HANK PYM’S QUANTUM TUNNEL. A MEANDERING RAT CRAWLS ONTO THE CONTROLS. IT ACCIDENTALLY STEPS ON A TOGGLE SWITCH and...A LIGHT GOES GREEN. FLASH. THE BACK DOORS OF THE VAN BLOW OPEN, revealing...SCOTT LANG, ANT-MAN suit shorting. He retracts his helmet, gasping. INT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE, SECURITY OFFICE - DAY A GUARD reads THE TERMINAL BEACH, by J.G. Ballard. He looks up at a monitor: SCOTT LANG holds up a sign, “HELP.” EXT. STORAGE WAREHOUSE - DAY A dented WAGON rolls over a speed-bump. Scott, in his old clothes, slowly wheels his belongings away. The Guard watches him go, puzzled. EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, STREET - DAY Scott walks A STREET OF ABANDONED HOMES. SCOTT LANG Hello? He hears A CLACKING. A KID on a bicycle rides by, playing card wedged between his spokes. Scott waves him down. The kid stops.   SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Hey. Kid. What happened here? The kid says nothing. He just stares at Scott with a haunted look. Then he stands on his pedal and keeps riding. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACK... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO, GOLDEN GATE PARK - DAY STONE MONUMENTS loom in a park. A small crowd mills. Reveal Scott looking over the monuments, lost. TIME CUT: Scott walks up to the obelisks. At the top, they read: “THE VANISHED.” Hundreds of names line the stones. He scans the “L’s,” finally finding, “SCOTT LANG.” SCOTT LANG What? (realizing) Cassie... EXT. MAGGIE LANG’S HOUSE - DAY A winded Scott races up the sidewalk toward his old house. He leaps a bush, banging on the front door. SCOTT LANG Cassie! Cassie! SOON, A TEEN GIRL opens the door, shocked. A very long beat. CASSIE LANG Dad? SCOTT LANG Peanut? Scott wraps his arms around CASSIE LANG (14), now five years older than when he last saw her. She hugs him, CRYING. CASSIE LANG I thought you were gone. SCOTT LANG I’m sorry. I’m back...I’m back...I’m back...   EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, FRONT GATE - DAWN Avengers Compound stands amidst overgrown grass. Rusty chains lock the gate. Faded signs warn: “RESTRICTED AREA. KEEP OUT.” INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA - NIGHT NATASHA SITS SURROUNDED BY HOLO-SCREENS FEATURING CAROL DANVERS, RHODEY, ROCKET AND NEBULA, AND OKOYE. ROCKET (HOLO) We boarded that “highly suspect warship” Danvers pinged. NATASHA And? NEBULA (HOLO) It was an infectious garbage scow. ROCKET (HOLO) So thanks for the hot tipCAROL DANVERS (HOLO) You were closer. ROCKET (HOLO) And now we smell like garbageNATASHA (to Okoye) You get a reading on those tremors? OKOYE (HOLO) Minor subduction in the African plate. NATASHA Do we have a visual? How are you handling it? OKOYE (HOLO) Nat. It was a mild earthquake. In the ocean. We handle it by not handling it. Natasha looks burdened. Rhodey steps in.  (MORE)  RHODEY (HOLO) I can have NASA redirect a satellite, do a sweep just to make sure. NATASHA Thanks. Carol, you’re still coming our way next month? CAROL DANVERS (HOLO) Not likely. ROCKET (HOLO) Getting another haircut? CAROL DANVERS (HOLO) Listen, fur-face, I’m covering a lot of territory out here. The things that have been happening on Earth have been happening everywhere else. On thousands of planets. You might not see me for a long time. NATASHA All right. Everybody keep keeping their eyes open. This channel’s always active. Anything goes sideways, anyone makes trouble where they shouldn’t, it comes through me. They ad lib their goodbyes as they sign off, except Rhodey. NATASHA (CONT'D) What’s up? Where are you? RHODEY (HOLO) Mexico. Got some news. NATASHA Okay... RHODEY Federalés found a room full of bodies outside Juarez. Cartel guys. Guns still in their pants. NATASHA Could be a rival hitRHODEY But it wasn’t. Same MO as Marseille. And Kiev. (MORE)  RHODEY (CONT'D)  (beat) It’s definitely Barton. She nods, grim, reluctantly accepting. RHODEY (CONT'D) What he’s done here...what he’s been doing...I got to tell you, part of me doesn’t want to find him. Natasha just stares a long beat. NATASHA Find out where’s he going next. Rhodey nods, signing off. Natasha sits there, THEN CRUMPLES. After a long beat... STEVE (O.S.) I’d offer to cook you dinner but you seem sad enough already. Natasha turns to see STEVE in the doorway. NATASHA Come by to do your laundry? STEVE And see a friend. NATASHA Your friend’s fine. STEVE She leave the house today? NATASHA Nothing out there I particularly want to see. STEVE I spotted a pod of whales coming over the bridge. NATASHA (dubious) In the Hudson. STEVE Fewer ships, cleaner water. Just saying, there’s still a world out there. RHODEY (CONT'D)   NATASHA If you’re about to tell me to look on the bright side, I’m about to hit you with a peanut butter sandwich. Steve relents, LETTING DOWN HIS FACADE. STEVE Sorry. Force of habit. NATASHA I don’t know how you do it. Steve bites into the uneaten half of her sandwich. STEVE I guess I don’t know how not to. NATASHA Me, neither. After a long moment, Steve looks up at her, honest. STEVE I keep telling them, move on. Grow past it. And some of them actually do. But not us. NATASHA If I move on, who does this? STEVE Maybe it doesn’t need to be done. Natasha takes that in. Steve is thinking of giving up. She looks around at Avengers Compound. NATASHA I used to have nothing. Then I got this. This job, this family. And I was better because of it. She chokes slightly, collecting herself. NATASHA (CONT'D) And even though they’re gone, I’m still trying to be...better. STEVE I think we both need to get a life. NATASHA You first.   They stare at each other a long, melancholy moment. THEN, WE HEAR A PING. NATASHA SWIPES TO A CCTV DISPLAY: SCOTT LANG’S FACE FILLS A SCREEN, LUIS’ VAN BEHIND HIM. SCOTT LANG (ON SCREEN) Hello? Is anyone home? This is, uh, Scott Lang? We met a few years ago. At the airport? STEVE This an old message? NATASHA (stunned) It’s the front gate. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - NIGHT SCOTT paces, mumbling to himself. STEVE (O.S.) Scott, are you okay? SCOTT LANG What? Yes. He turns to STEVE and NATASHA. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? NATASHA Only to make conversation. Steve glances at her. She shrugs. SCOTT LANG Well, five years ago, just before this Thanos guy...I went into a place called the Quantum Realm. It’s like its own microscopic universe. You can only get there if you’re incredibly small. Hope, she’s my...she was supposed to pull me out. But then Thanos happened. And I was stuck in there. NATASHA I’m sorry. It must’ve been a long five years.   SCOTT LANG (getting excited) Okay, but that’s the thing. It wasn’t. For me, it was only five hours. The rules in the Quantum Realm aren’t like out here. They’re completely unpredictable. Is anybody gonna eat that sandwich? STEVE Scott, what are you talking about? SCOTT LANG Time works differently in the Quantum Realm. Steve and Natasha share a look. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Problem is, right now, it’s chaos, there’s no way to navigate it. But what if we could figure out a way to enter the Quantum Realm at a certain point in time...and come out in another. Like, before ThanosSTEVE Wait...wait. Scott. Are you talking about a time machine? SCOTT LANG No, not a machine. More like a... (searches, then gives up) Yeah, like a time machine. I know it sounds crazy... NATASHA Scott, I get emails from a raccoon. Nothing’s crazy anymore. SCOTT LANG So, who do we talk to about this? EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, UPSTATE NEW YORK - DAY LLAMAS and FARM ANIMALS GRAZE A RUSTIC-TECH ECO-COMPOUND. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, WOODS - DAY TONY approaches A WOODED GLADE near the house.   TONY Morgan H. Stark. Chow time. Want some lunch? Silence. Then MORGAN STARK (4) steps out of her play tent, wearing A PURPLE-BLUE IRON MAN HELMET (RESCUE). MORGAN STARK Define lunch or be disintegrated. TONY You should not be wearing that. It’s part of a special anniversary gift I made for Mom. You thinking about lunch? Tony gently takes the helmet off, revealing A YOUNG GIRL. TONY (CONT'D) Where’d you find this? MORGAN STARK Garage. Tony picks her up, walking toward the house. TONY You like going in the garage? So does Daddy. It’s all right. Mommy never wears what I buy her. TIME CUT: Tony and Morgan exit the woods. Suddenly, Tony stops. In the driveway, STEVE ROGERS stares at him. NATASHA AND SCOTT GET OUT OF THE CAR BEHIND HIM. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH - DAY STEVE, SCOTT, and NATASHA sit with TONY. TONY I just want to thank you folks for dropping by. It’s not every day one gets to contemplate biting it on an inter-dimensional timescape. NATASHA You’ve got some objections to the plan.   TONY So you’re calling it a plan. To me, it sounds like an exotic suicide method. Not to mention, it’s impossible. SCOTT LANG We know what it sounds like. STEVE Tony, after what you’ve seen, is anything really impossible? TONY Quantum fluctuation kinda messes with the Planck Scale, which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition, can we agree on that? (offering more tea) Chai? (back on message) In layman’s terms, it means you can cancel your Netflix subscription because you’re not coming home. SCOTT LANG I did. TONY Which was a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. Now you want to pull aWhat are you calling it? SCOTT LANG A time heist. TONY Oh, of course, a time heist, why didn’t we think of this before? Right, because it’s a pipe dream. Who are you again? SCOTT LANG Still Scott... STEVE Tony, the Stones exist in the past. We could get them and bring them here. NATASHA We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back.   TONY Or screw it up worse than he already has. STEVE I don’t believe we would. Tony stares at Steve, a lot of water under the bridge. TONY Gotta say it. Sometimes I’ve missed that giddy optimism. Sadly, all your high hopes won’t help me if there’s no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said “time heist.” I believe the most likely outcome would be our collective demise. SCOTT LANG Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. No talking to our past selves. No betting on sporting eventsTONY Stop, Scott. Stop. Are you telling me that your plan to save the universe is more than loosely based on Back to the Future? SCOTT LANG (meaning “yes”) No... TONY Good. Because that would be horseshit. Scientifically speaking, your brother’s picture doesn’t disappear just ‘cause you went to the dance with your mom. That’s not how quantum physics works. NATASHA We have to take a stand. TONY We did stand. And yet here we are. SCOTT LANG Look, Stark- Can I call you Tony?   TONY Please don’tSCOTT LANG TonyTONY Fine. SCOTT LANG I get that you’ve got a lot on the line, here. You’ve got a wife. A daughter. But I lost someone very important - a lot of us did - and now we have a chance to save her, and everyone else, and you won’t evenTONY No, Scott. I won’t. Even. Suddenly, MORGAN walks onto the porch. MORGAN STARK Mommy told me to come save you. Tony takes Morgan into his arms and heads inside. TONY Good job. I’m saved. (to Steve) I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. I’m honestly happy to see you. If you want to staySteve tries one last time. STEVE Tony, I get it. And I’m happy for you. I am. But this is a second chance. TONY Yeah, well, I got my second chance right here. I can’t roll the dice on it. The table is set for six. If you don’t talk shop, you’re welcome to stay for lunch. He exits.   EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND - DAY Steve, Natasha, and Scott walk toward the car. NATASHA He’s scared. STEVE He’s not wrong. SCOTT LANG What are we gonna do? We need him. You want to stop? STEVE No. I want to do it right. (beat) We’re going to need a really big brain. SCOTT LANG Bigger than his? EXT. DINER - NIGHT ONLOOKERS crowd a diner window, trying to peek inside. SCOTT LANG (O.S.) I’m confused. INT. DINER - NIGHT SMART HULK ROLLS UP A PIZZA AND EATS IT LIKE A BURRITO. SCOTT, STEVE, AND NATASHA SIT ACROSS FROM HIM. SMART HULK These are confusing times. SCOTT LANG No, that’s not what I’mSMART HULK I’m kidding, I get it. It’s crazy. I wear shirts now! SCOTT LANG But why? SMART HULK Five years ago, we got our asses kicked, right?  ---  Smart Hulk eats a stack of pancakes in two bites. STEVE He’s heard. SMART HULK It was worse for me. Because I lost twice. First Hulk lost. Then Banner lost. Then we all lost. NATASHA No one blamed you, Bruce. SMART HULK I did- I feel like I’m the only one eating. Here, try some. He holds out a pizza. They decline. He shrugs. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Thing is, I kept thinking, it didn’t have to be that way. That the best of Banner and best of Hulk, if they’d worked together, maybe they could’ve stopped Thanos. SCOTT LANG Okay. But how did...this happen? SMART HULK For years I treated the Hulk like a disease, something to get rid of. But when I started treating him like the cure... Smart Hulk MESHES HIS FINGERS together. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Eighteen months in the Gamma Lab. I put the brains and the brawn together. And now look at me. Best of both worlds. TWO KIDS amble up to the booth. KID Mr. Hulk? Can we get a picture? SMART HULK 100%, little lady. The kid hands a phone to Steve. SMART HULK makes a duck face as Steve sheepishly snaps the pic, handing the phone back.   SMART HULK (CONT'D) (to the fan) Thanks, pal. Hulk out! STEVE So, Bruce, about what we saidSMART HULK The time travel do-over? I don’t know, that’s kind of outside my field of expertise... Natasha nods at his Smart Hulk-ness, history between them. NATASHA You pulled this off. I remember a time that was impossible, too. He considers, then finally relents, pulling out his phone. SMART HULK I’m supposed to be on Oprah next week, but I guess I could move things around. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, KITCHEN - NIGHT TONY STARK DOES DISHES. He rinses with the sprayer. It goes everywhere. He wipes down the counter, including... A PICTURE OF PETER PARKER. He stares. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, SIDE PORCH - NIGHT Tony builds HOLO MODELS: Penrose diagrams, wormholes. He studies a STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR, intrigued. TONY Friday, you up? FRIDAY Yes, sir. TONY I’ve had a mild inspiration, like to see if it checks out. I would like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. This time, in the shape of a Mobius Strip, inverted.   FRIDAY Processing. The model forms. TONY All right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle, factoring in spectral decomp. Run it. That’ll take a second. And don’t worry if it doesn’t pan out, I’m just kind of... THE CAPACITOR GLOWS. A HOLO-MAN DRIFTS INTO A CIRCULAR WORMHOLE, LOOPING...RETURNING TO THE PLACE IT FIRST LEFT. FRIDAY Model rendered. TONY (in awe) Shit. MORGAN STARK (O.S.) Shit. Tony turns to see HIS DAUGHTER in the doorway. TONY What are you doing up? MORGAN STARK Shit. TONY First of all, that’s a Mommy word, she coined it. MORGAN STARK Why are you up? TONY I just had something on my mind. MORGAN STARK Was it juice pops? TONY Correct. Great minds think alike. What kind do you want?   INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, MORGAN’S ROOM - NIGHT Morgan eats A JUICE POP in bed. Tony watches. TONY You done? (finishing her popsicle) Now you are. MORGAN STARK Tell me a story. TONY Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. MORGAN STARK That was a bad story. He runs his hand over her hair. TONY Love you tons. MORGAN STARK Love you three thousand. TONY Wow, that’s a lot. Tony turns out the light, exits. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT PHOTOS crowd a side table: Pepper, Morgan, Tony. Even one of HOWARD STARK, PEGGY CARTER & HANK PYM UNDER A SHIELD SYMBOL. Find...PEPPER, curled up on the couch reading. Then... TONY (O.S.) Out like a light. Don’t know how much she loves you but she loves me three thousand. PEPPER POTTS That’s up there. TONY What’re you reading? PEPPER POTTS A book about composting  TONY I think I solved it. Pepper looks up. PEPPER POTTS Just so we’re both talking about the same thingTONY Time travel. PEPPER POTTS That’s amazing. TONY Yeah. PEPPER POTTS And terrifying. TONY To say the least. He sits beside her. She stares, SHARING IN HIS DILEMMA. PEPPER POTTS We got really luckyTONY I knowPEPPER POTTS Not everybody did. TONY I can’t help everybody. PEPPER POTTS Except, it sort of seems like you can. TONY Not if I stopped right here. PEPPER POTTS Tony, trying to get you to stop is one of the few failures of my life. TONY I could just lock the lab, put it in a trunk, sink it to the bottom of the lake, and go to bed.   PEPPER POTTS But could you rest? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT WAITS IN HIS ANT-MAN 2 QUANTUM SUIT IN FRONT OF THE OPEN VAN DOORS. SCOTT LANG You’re sure these modifications are safe? He looks over to...SMART HULK, WEARING READING GLASSES, MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO A NEW CONTROL PANEL. SMART HULK I reran my calculations three timesSCOTT LANG Because the guy who invented this thing is pretty much a geniusSMART HULK I have seven PhD’s, an MD, the Hans Bethe Award for Physics, and I’m personal friends with Bill Nye the Science Guy. We’re good. SCOTT LANG Yeah. And you look like that on purpose. STEVE and NATASHA enter from outside. STEVE Breakers are set, emergency generator’s on stand-by. SMART HULK Good. If we blow the grid, I don’t want to lose Tiny back in the ‘50’s. SCOTT LANG Excuse me? NATASHA He was kidding. SMART HULK I was kidding.   NATASHA (to Hulk) You were kidding, right? SMART HULK Honestly, I have no idea. We’re attempting time travel. Either it’s all a joke, or none of it is. (loudly to Scott) We’re good! Helmet on. Scott puts on his helmet, slightly dubious. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Okay. I’m going to send you back one week, give you an hour to look around, then bring you back in ten seconds. Make sense? SCOTT LANG Perfectly not confusing. STEVE Good luck, Scott. You’ve got this. SCOTT LANG (inspired) Yes, I do, Captain America. Yes, ISMART HULK PULLS A LEVER. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. SMART HULK Counting down from three, two, one... SUDDENLY SCOTT REAPPEARS...BUT HE’S 12-YEARS-OLD. SCOTT LANG Uh, guys? This doesn’t feel right. NATASHA Is that Scott? SMART HULK Probably...? He scrambles, hitting buttons. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING. STEVE Get him back! Smart Hulk flips a switch. SCOTT REAPPEARS...AT AGE 93.   SCOTT LANG Oh, my back! NATASHA Bruce! Get it under control. What the hell is going on? SMART HULK I got it, I know exactly what’s going on. Pretty much. SCOTT SHRINKS TO NOTHING AGAIN. HULK TYPES FRANTICALLY with A PENCIL, fingers too big for the keys. 2-YEAR OLD SCOTT APPEARS. NATASHA Oh, my God. STEVE It’s a baby. SMART HULK It’s Scott. STEVE As a baby! Smart Hulk hits a button. Baby Scott disappears. SMART HULK When I tell you, kill the power! (throwing a switch) Now! NATASHA KILLS THE POWER. Normal Scott stumbles off the pad. SCOTT LANG Somebody peed my pants. I don’t know if it was baby-me or old-me. Or just me-me. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY Steve leans on the wall, discouraged. Then he hears AN ENGINE ROAR. AN AUDI races up the drive. It stops, the window rolling down to reveal...TONY. TONY Why the long face? Wild guess, he turned into a baby?   STEVE Among other things. TONY (getting out of the car) EPR Paradox. Instead of pushing Lang through time, you were pushing time through Lang. It’s dangerous. I probably should’ve cautioned you against it. STEVE You did. TONY Thank god, I’m here. Regardless, I fixed it. He holds up...HIS STAR-SHAPED CAPACITOR. TONY (CONT'D) That is a fully-functioning, timespace GPS. I just want peace. Resentment is corrosive. I hate it. STEVE Me, too. Something eases between them, for the first time in years. TONY We’ve got a shot at the Stones. I just need you to know my priorities. Bring back everyone we lost, hopefully. Keep what I found, definitely. And, let’s not die trying. Steve looks at Tony. Finally, he offers his hand. STEVE Sounds like a deal. They shake. This is a long time coming. Finally... TONY But wait, there’s more. Act now, and it comes with a bonus offer. Tony pops the trunk. Steve stares, moved, at...HIS SHIELD. STEVE Tony, I don’t know  TONY What’s to know? He made it for you. Plus, I gotta get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. Steve finally picks up the shield, SLIDING IT ONTO HIS ARM. STEVE Thank you, Tony. Tony chokes up, then covers by slamming the trunk. TONY Just don’t flaunt it. I didn’t bring enough for the whole team. We are getting the whole team, right? STEVE We’re trying. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY SCOTT sits on a bench, eating a hardshell taco. THEN A MASSIVE EXHAUST WIND BLASTS HIM, blowing his taco away. THE BENATAR lands outside AVENGERS COMPOUND. NEBULA AND ROCKET EMERGE. Rocket waits at the end of the gangway. ROCKET Hey, Humie. Where’s Big Green? SCOTT LANG Um, kitchen, I think. Scott tries a smile at Nebula. She just hits her COM: NEBULA (INTO COM) Rhodey, careful on re-entry. There’s an idiot in the landing zone. She goes in. THEN, WHAM, WAR MACHINE LANDS, STARTLING SCOTT. SCOTT LANG Oh, my God! RHODEY What’s up, Regular-Sized Man? Rhodey goes inside as SMART HULK walks out, carrying an overnight bag. He hands Scott some tacos.   ROCKET Finally. I ain’t got all day. SMART HULK I call shotgun! As he walks up the Benatar’s gangway, PRE-LAP A METALLIC SCRAPING SOUND. EXT. NEW ASGARD - DAY The scraping goes on as we see...A NORWEGIAN FISHING VILLAGE. Tilt to a sign: “NEW ASGARD,” in English and ASGARDIAN RUNES. A PICK-UP passes, scraping the pavement: SMART HULK AND ROCKET SIT IN BACK, WEIGHING DOWN THE TRUCK. EXT. NEW ASGARD, VILLAGE - DAY SMART HULK AND ROCKET WALK THROUGH TOWN. ASGARDIANS IN EARTHLY CLOTHES EYE THEM WITH SUSPICION. ROCKET What the heck are they looking at? SMART HULK I’m kind of famous... ROCKET Yeah, I’m sure that’s it. Kind of a step down from golden palaces and magic hammers... SMART HULK They lost Asgard, then half their people. Maybe they’re just happy to have a home. VALKYRIE (O.S.) You shouldn’t have come. VALKYRIE approaches from the pier. Smart Hulk GRINS. SMART HULK Hey, Valkyrie! Great to see you! He goes for a hug...VAL DOESN’T. She studies the new him. VALKYRIE Uh huh. I liked you better either of the other ways.   SMART HULK This is Rocket. ROCKET Hey. VALKYRIE Hey. (to both) He won’t see you. SMART HULK We didn’t say we were here to seeVALKYRIE Great, then you can hose out the gut bucketsROCKET We’re definitely here to see him. VALKYRIE He can’t give you what you need. SMART HULK It’s that bad? VALKYRIE We only see him once a month. When he comes in for “supplies.” She nods to A DOZEN BEER KEGS STACKED OUTSIDE A PUB. EXT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY Smart Hulk and Rocket knock on the door of A CABIN. Nothing. INT. NEW ASGARD, CABIN - DAY SMART HULK opens the door. PIZZA BOXES and LIQUOR BOTTLES litter the floor. Rocket recoils. ROCKET Something died in here. SMART HULK Hello...? Thor...? THOR (O.S.) Are you here about the cable? We hear a HEAVY SHUFFLING as someone approaches.   THOR (CONT'D) Cinemax went out two days ago, and the sports are all...fuzzy... THOR enters, CONFUSED, A LITTLE DRUNK, SHIRTLESS...AND TREMENDOUSLY FAT. Rocket and Hulk stare. SMART HULK Thor? THOR BROS! Bring it in! Thor hugs Smart Hulk. He turns to Rocket, who steps back. ROCKET Yeah, I’m good. THOR Hulk, you know my boys, Korg and Miek, right? KORG and MIEK sit on the couch, playing Playstation 4. KORG Beer’s in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the WiFi. SMART HULK Hey, guys. Long time noKORG Thor! This kid on the TV just called me a dickhead! THOR Noobmaster again? KORG NoobMaster69 called me a dickheadThor snatches KORG’S HEADSET and hisses into the mic. THOR Noobmaster, this is Thor, again. God of Thunder. This is your last warning. Log off this game or I will come to your basement, rip off your arms and shove them up your butt. (handing the headset back) Right, who wants a drink?  (MORE)  SMART HULK AND ROCKET JUST STARE. Thor pulls a beer from the fridge, and whacks the cap against STORMBREAKER. SMART HULK Hey, buddy, are you all right? THOR Don’t I look all right? ROCKET (under his breath) You look like melted ice creamTHOR So, what’s up? Just here for a hang? SMART HULK We need your help. There’s a chance we can fix everything. THOR Like the cable? It’s driving me bananas. SMART HULK Like Thanos. THOR GRABS HULK’S SHIRT, INTENSE. KORG RISES FROM THE COUCH. THOR Don’t say that name. KORG Yeah, we don’t say that name in here. Smart Hulk looks down at THOR’S HAND STILL ON HIS SHIRT. SMART HULK Please take your hand off me. Thor looks into Hulk’s eyes...and gently removes his hand. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Now, I know the thought of...that guy might scare youTHOR Scared? Why would I be scared of that guy? I’m the one who killed that guy, remember? (looking around) Anyone else here kill that guy? (MORE)  THOR (CONT'D)  Didn’t think so. Korg, tell everyone who chopped Thanos’ head off. KORG Stormbreaker? Thor uncaps a whiskey bottle. BLAM, IT SHATTERS IN HIS HAND. Reveal...ROCKET, BLASTER SMOKING. THOR Not. Cool. Man. ROCKET Don’t. Care. Dude. SMART HULK Look, I get it. You’re in a rough patch. I’ve been there. But you know who helped me out of it? THOR Was it Natasha? SMART HULK It was you. You helped me. And I need you to help me again. THOR Ask the Asgardians down there how much “my help” is worth. ROCKET At least they’re aliveTHOR They were gods! Now they’re fisherpeople! (sagging into a chair) The ones that are left, anyway. SMART HULK That’s the thing. I think we can bring them back. Thor’s tempted, but shakes his head. THOR Stop. Stop. I know you think I’m down here, wallowing in my own selfpity, waiting to be rescued. But I’m fine. I’m happy. Whatever it is you’re offering, don’t care. Couldn’t care less. THOR (CONT'D)   Hulk and Rocket stare at Thor. SMART HULK Come on, pal. We need you. He still can’t meet their gaze. Finally... ROCKET There’s beer in the ship. THOR (beat) What kind? EXT. TOKYO - NIGHT A KARAOKE BAR LIES IN RUINS AS A TINNY POP SONG PLAYS. BLOOD POOLS BENEATH DEAD YAKUZA THUGS, UZIS JUST OUT OF REACH OF THEIR TATTOOED HANDS. TITLE: “TOKYO.” AS WE PULL BACK...THE MUSIC FADES, REPLACED BY A SOFT CRYING. A TERRIFIED HOSTESS DARTS FROM COVER, WIPING AWAY THE CHYRON. KEEP PULLING BACK...PAST A CAR SMASHED THROUGH THE FRONT WINDOW, TATTOOED DRIVER SLUMPED OVER THE WHEEL, GUN IN HAND. WE HEAR RAIN, A REVVING ENGINE, AND THEN GUNFIRE. PULL ONTO THE SIDEWALK, TURNING JUST AS A MOTORCYCLE CRASHES, RIDER TUMBLING PAST US IN A WHITE MOHAWKED HELMET. ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE RACES TOWARD US, BUT... WHFT-WHFT, TWO ARROWS SEND THE RIDER SKIDDING INTO A WALL, TIRES SQUEALING AS THE BIKE SPINS HELPLESSLY ON ITS SIDE. CAMERA TURNS TOWARD AN ALCOVE, WHERE A YAKUZA THUG TUMBLES OFF THE STAIRS AS... A MASKED FIGURE HEADS UP, STOPPING MOMENTARILY TO DRAW HIS TELESCOPING BLADE. BEHIND THE SMOKED GLASS OF SECOND FLOOR WINDOWS, THE FIGURE FIGHTS ANOTHER THUG. THEN... CRASH, THE THUG COMES SMASHING THROUGH THE WINDOW. THUD. WHIP THROUGH THE RAIN TO THE UPPER FLOORS OF THE BUILDING. GUNFIRE FLASHES AS THE FIGHT CONTINUES PAST THREE WINDOWS...   SUDDENLY, THE FOURTH WINDOW SHATTERS AS A YAKUZA BOSS, AKIHIKO, LEAPS OVER THE SIDEWALK... LANDING ON THE METAL AWNING OF A NOODLE SHOP. HE ROLLS TO THE WET STREET, LANDING HARD ON HIS ANKLE. THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURE GRACEFULLY LEAPS AFTER HIM, BOUNCING OFF THE AWNING AND DROPPING TO THE STREET BELOW. RACK UP TO GET OUR BEST LOOK YET AT...RONIN. HARD-SET EYES STARE AT AKIHIKO THROUGH A BLACK MASK. THEY BATTLE. AKIHIKO (Japanese, subtitled) Why are you doing this? We never did anything to you! RONIN (Japanese, subtitled) You survived. Half the planet didn’t. They got Thanos. You get me. Akihiko attacks. Ronin slashes him across the middle. RONIN (CONT'D) (Japanese, subtitled) You’re done hurting people. Akihiko gestures at the bodies in the street. AKIHIKO We hurt people? You’re crazy. Ronin slashes Akihiko’s throat. The man drops to his knees. AKIHIKO (CONT'D) Wait! Help me! I’ll give you anything! What do you want? RONIN What I want...you can’t give me. Ronin finishes him off. AKIHIKO GOES STILL. SIRENS WAIL. Ronin removes his mask, revealing... CLINT BARTON, haggard. He hears A FOOTFALL. He whirls, katana raised...then stops. His face goes slack as... NATASHA STEPS INTO A POOL OF LIGHT, A LARGE BLACK UMBRELLA KEEPING HER FROM THE RAIN. They stare at each other. Clint hasn’t seen her in years. She hasn’t seen what he’s become.  --  CLINT BARTON You shouldn’t be here. NATASHA Neither should you. CLINT BARTON I’ve got a job to do. NATASHA That what you’re calling this? She moves even closer. He stiffens. NATASHA (CONT'D) Killing these people isn’t going to bring your family back. (beat) We found something. A chance, maybe... CLINT BARTON Don’t. NATASHA Don’t what? CLINT BARTON Give me hope. NATASHA I’m just sorry I couldn’t give it sooner. CLINT DISSOLVES, sagging into her arms. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THOR STANDS WITH A BEER IN A COZY, staring at A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (2.0), AFFIXED WITH TONY’S CAPACITOR. TONY (O.S.) Out of the way, Lebowski. Thor shuffles aside as Tony blows past. TONY (CONT'D) Hey, Ratchet, you get lost in there? ROCKET (O.S.) It’s Rocket, and shut up. You’re only a genius on Earth, pal.   TONY And you’re only in there because you have tiny hands. ROCKET, COVERED IN GREASE, WRIGGLES OUT A HATCH. ROCKET Fixed it. TONY Thank you. ROCKET Get used to saying that. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY SMART HULK fits SCOTT with A BRAND NEW TIME SUIT. NEBULA ASSISTS. RHODEY enters the workshop, eyeing the suit. RHODEY Time travel suit, I like it. SMART HULK awkwardly tries to fit a pair of RED TEST TUBES INTO THE TIME SUIT’S BELT. SCOTT LANG Easy, easy. Careful with those. SMART HULK I’m being very carefulSCOTT LANG You’re being very HulkyScott takes the tubes from him and inserts them, himself. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) These are Pym Particles. You can’t shrink to the Quantum Realm without them, and since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, we can’t make any more. I told you. We’ve only got enough for one round trip each, no do-overs. Scott gently clicks the tubes into their housing. SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) Plus two test runsSUDDENLY, SCOTT SHRINKS INTO NOTHING, THEN GROWS BACK. He takes that in...   SCOTT LANG (CONT'D) One test run. (embarrassed) Okay, maybe I’m not ready. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) I’m game. They turn to see CLINT leaning in the doorway. CLINT BARTON (CONT'D) I’ll do it. TIME CUT: NOW, CLINT WEARS THE TIME SUIT. Scott looks on, sulky. SMART HULK, RHODEY, and NEBULA attach the Pym housing. SMART HULK Okay, Clint, you might feel a little disoriented when you chronoshiftRHODEY Hang on, I’ve got to ask, if we can do this, why don’t we just go find baby Thanos and, you know... Rhodey makes a STRANGLING GESTURE. SMART HULK Uh, one, because that’s horrible. And, two, killing baby Thanos doesn’t kill adult Thanos. Time doesn’t work like that. You can’t change the future by changing the past. SCOTT LANG Sure, we can. We take the stones before Thanos gets them, then he doesn’t have them. Problem solved. NEBULA That’s not how it works. CLINT BARTON I don’t know. That is kind of what I’ve heardSMART HULK Heard from who?   RHODEY Star Trek. Terminator. Bill and Ted’s ExcellentSMART HULK WHY DOES EVERYONE THINK THIS? THAT’S NOT TRUE. IF YOU TRAVEL TO THE PAST, THEN THAT PAST HAS BECOME YOUR PRESENT, AND YOUR FORMER PRESENT HAS BECOME THE PAST, WHICH NOW CAN’T BE CHANGED BY YOUR NEW FUTURE! NEBULA Exactly. RHODEY Excuse me? Scott leans over, whispering: SCOTT LANG Apparently, Back to the Future is bullshit. CLINT BARTON Look, are we doing this or not? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT WAITS ALONE ON THE PLATFORM, WEARING THE TIME SUIT. SMART HULK readies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE as ROCKET, RHODEY, NEBULA, THOR, and STEVE look on. SMART HULK Okay, Clint. Starting in three, two, one... Clint nods over at them, determined. SUDDENLY, HE STRETCHES, SHRINKS, AND VANISHES. WHOOSH. EXT. BARTON HOME, BARN - DAY Through the slats of a barn, we see a tractor. ENERGY FLARES, REVEALING CLINT BARTON IN A TIME SUIT. He walks to the open door, staring at...HIS OLD HOME.   EXT./INT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY Clint climbs the porch. He accidentally kicks...A BASEBALL MITT. Then he hears VOICES. He stares into the house through THE SCREEN DOOR. From the sounds of it, LAURA and THE KIDS are making dinner. HIS DAUGHTER LAUGHS. Clint’s face crumples. Just then...HIS QUANTUM CUFF VIBRATES. A SCREEN COUNTS DOWN: 0:03. CLINT BARTON No. Not yet... (opening the door) LILA! BUT HIS BODY STARTS TO GLOW. 0.01- CLINT VANISHES. THE SCREEN DOOR SLAMS. After a moment, LILA runs in. LILA BARTON Dad? INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY CLINT APPEARS ON THE PAD, SHAKEN. TONY and NATASHA approach. NATASHA Are you all right? Hey, look at me. You okay? TONY Tell me something good... Clint looks up, tearful. He holds out THE BASEBALL MITT. CLINT BARTON It worked. It worked. Reveal Steve, Smart Hulk, Nebula, Rhodey, Scott, Thor, and Rocket, looking on. ROCKET Holy crap. We’re freaking time travelers. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 1 - DAY (MOCO) On a HOLO-BOARD: “MIND, SPACE, TIME, POWER, REALITY, SOUL.” Above each word hovers...ITS ARTIFACT: LOKI’S SCEPTER, THE TESSERACT, THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO, THE ORB, THE AETHER CONTAINER, AND A QUESTION MARK.   STEVE Okay. Now that we’ve got how, we’re going to need where and when. NEBULA, TONY, RHODEY, SCOTT, SMART HULK, ROCKET, NATASHA, and CLINT look on. STEVE (CONT'D) Most folks here have encountered at least one of the six Infinity StonesTONY I think you mean nearly been killed by one of the six Infinity Stones. SCOTT LANG I haven’t. (off their looks) Just...saying. SMART HULK Regardless, we’ve only got enough Pym Particles for one round trip, each. And the Stones have been in a lot of places throughout history. TONY Our history. Not all of them are going to be a fun drop-in. CLINT BARTON Which means we’ve got to pick our targets. STEVE Exactly. (he taps “REALITY”) Let’s start with the Aether. Thor, what do we know? Everyone looks toward...THOR, slumped over. NATASHA Is he asleep? RHODEY I’m pretty sure he’s dead. DISSOLVE TO: THOR sulks, looking at the Aether Container Holo: “REALITY” Locations are listed: “SVARTALFHEIM, KNOWHERE, LONDON.”  (MORE)  THOR The Aether’s not a stone, it’s more of an angry sludge. My grandfather hid it from Dark Elves in a rock between dimensions that can only be accessed every 5000 years. HIS ROBOTIC EYE drifts off in the wrong direction. Thor bangs his head, resetting his eye. THOR (CONT'D) Or...by Jane. She stuck her hand in a rock. Then the Aether stuck itself inside her. Then I took her to Asgard. We were dating... (depressed) We’re not anymore. Everyone stares. DISSOLVE TO: INT.

ROCKET Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. He paces on top of the table, past SMART HULK EATING A PINT OF “HUNKA HULKA BURNING FUDGE.” SMART HULK That’s a person? ROCKET It’s a planet. Quill was a person. SCOTT LANG Wait, like a planet...in space? Rocket pinches Scott’s cheek. ROCKET Aw, look. It’s like a puppy, all happy and everything. (MORE)  ROCKET (CONT'D)  You want to go to space, puppy? I’ll take you to space. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, SITTING AREA - DAY Scott, Steve, Natasha, Clint, Rocket, and Smart Hulk sit quietly, listening to Nebula. NEBULA Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. NATASHA And that is...? NEBULA A dominion of death at the very center of celestial existence. (beat) It’s the place where Thanos murdered my sister. That hangs heavily. A moment passes. Then... SCOTT LANG Not it. DISSOLVE TO: INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, OFFICE - DAY, EARLY Tony, Natasha, and Smart Hulk hash it out. NATASHA So this ‘Time Stone’ guy...what kind of doctor was he? SMART HULK Strange? TONY Cross between ear-nose-and-throat and rabbit-from-hat. SMART HULK Had a nice place in the Village. TONY Yeah. Sullivan Street. ROCKET (CONT'D)   SMART HULK Bleecker. TONY Sullivan and Bleecker. They’re cross streets. NATASHA Wait, he lived in New York? Guys, pick the right year and there were three stones in New York. SMART HULK (beat) Shut the front door... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LIVING AREA, DAY 3 - DAY STEVE blocks our view. STEVE Okay, we have a plan. Six stones, three teams, one shot. He steps away, revealing the board... EVERYONE EYES THE TANGLE OF LINES CONNECTING SIX STONES TO FOUR LOCATIONS TO TWO YEARS TO TEN HEROES. IT’S INSANE. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAWN DAWN RISES OUTSIDE HUGE WINDOWS. OUR HEROES MARCH PAST IN THEIR TIME SUITS. STEVE (O.S.) Five years ago, we lost. All of us. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY THE HEROES GATHER ON THE QUANTUM PLATFORM. STEVE We lost friends. We lost family. We lost a part of ourselves. (beat) But today we have a chance to take it all back. Steve takes in the groupings of heroes: RHODEY & NEBULA, NAT & CLINT, THOR & ROCKET, TONY & SCOTT.   STEVE (CONT'D) You have your teams and you have assignments. Get your stone, and get back here. One round trip each. No mistakes. No do-overs. He grips HIS SHIELD. STEVE (CONT'D) Most of us are going back to places we know. That doesn’t mean we know what to expect. Be careful. Look out for each other. Improvise, if you have to. (looking around) This is the fight of our lives. And we’re going to win. (beat) Whatever it takes. The platform stays quiet. Rocket WHISPERS to Scott: ROCKET He’s pretty good at that... Scott nods enthusiastically. TONY (to Smart Hulk) All right, you heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. Smart Hulk taps in commands with HIS PENCIL. LIGHTS ILLUMINATE EACH PAD. SMART HULK Tracking beacons engaged. Clint checks his pocket: A SHRUNKEN BENATAR sits inside. ROCKET You promise to bring that thing back in one piece? CLINT BARTON Yeah, sure thing. I’ll do my best. ROCKET That’s pretty lame, as far as promises go. SMART HULK STEPS ONTO THE PLATFORM, COMPLETING THE LINEUP. THE PLATFORM BEGINS TO VIBRATE. NATASHA LOOKS AROUND.   NATASHA See you in a minute. SMART HULK Actually, it’ll be closer to seven or eight microseconds, give orSUDDENLY, THEY STRETCH AND VANISH, SHRINKING AWAY. WHOOSH. THE QUANTUM CONSOLE STOPS VIBRATING.

Stay low, keep an eye on timeJust then, A1 HULK BOUNDS DOWN THE STREET SMASHING THINGS. STEVE (CONT'D) And Bruce? Maybe smash a few things along the way. For appearances. SMART HULK (taking off his shirt) All right, but I have to say, it seems gratuitous. He half-heartedly smashes a few cars.   SMART HULK (CONT'D) Grrr...grrr... EXT. SANCTUM SANCTORUM, ROOF - DAY (AVENGERS 1) THE BATTLE OF NEW YORK RAGES. CHITAURI CHARIOTS ZOOM OVER THE VILLAGE. SUDDENLY...BOOM, THE CHARIOTS EXPLODE. ON ONE SIDE OF THE SANCTUM ROOF, A TINY, HOODED FIGURE hurls jagged mandalas into the sky. ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOF...SMART HULK LANDS. He heads for a door, but... ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) I’d be careful going that way... He turns to find...THE ANCIENT ONE STARING AT HIM. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) We just had the floors waxed. SMART HULK THINKS, THEN GROWLS, TRYING TO INTIMIDATE HER. SMART HULK Hulk...does what...Hulk want? ANCIENT ONE Yes, I suppose that would be the caseJUST THEN, ON THE ROOF OPPOSITE, A1 HULK TACKLES A CHITAURI CHARIOT, RIPPING IT IN HALF. HE ROARS, LEAPING AWAY. Smart Hulk blinks, sheepish. The Ancient One looks at him. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Care to explain? SMART HULK I’m looking for Dr. Strange. ANCIENT ONE You’re about five years too early. Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery, 20 blocks that way. What do you want with him? He finally notices THE EYE OF AGAMOTTO HANGING FROM HER NECK. SMART HULK Well, that, actually. ANCIENT ONE Ah. I’m afraid not. SMART HULK I’m seriously sorry but...I wasn’t asking. Smart Hulk cracks his knuckles and moves in. She smiles. ANCIENT ONE You don’t want to do this. SMART HULK You’re right, I don’t. But I need that stone, and I don’t have a lot of time to debate itHe reaches for it. THE ANCIENT ONE SLAMS HER PALM INTO HIS CHEST AND BLASTS BRUCE BANNER RIGHT OUT OF SMART HULK. “ASTRAL BANNER” hangs in the air, staring at his frozen Smart Hulk body. He looks at his human hands, overwhelmed. ASTRAL BANNER No, no, noShe topples Smart Hulk’s body with one finger. Whump. ANCIENT ONE Now. Let’s start over, shall we? INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) TITLE: ASGARD, 2013 AN ASGARDIAN MAIDEN stands at JANE’S ROOM, handing over A GREEN DRESS. MAIDEN (O.S.) For you, Lady Jane. JANE FOSTER (O.S.) Um, do you have anything with...pants? MAIDEN (O.S.) Pants? JANE FOSTER (O.S.) It’s okay. Nevermind. Pull back to...ROCKET AND THOR, WATCHING from behind a crypt. Rocket holds a syringe-like EXTRACTION DEVICE.   THOR That’s Jane. ROCKET Okay, here’s the deal. You’re going to charm her, and I’m going to poke her with this thing, extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split. Thor looks off in the other direction, anxious. THOR Um, I’ll be right back. The wine cellar is just down here. My father used to have this barrel of Aakonian ale. Felt like getting hit in the face with a poleaxe. I’ll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cupsThey hear SOMEONE APPROACHING. Rocket yanks Thor back as...FRIGGA AND HER HANDMAIDENS ENTER THE CORRIDOR. FRIGGA Send Loki some soup. I don’t think he’s eating. And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelves. He won’t read them, but at least they’ll keep him company. Thor watches Frigga and her coterie disappear down the hall. ROCKET Who’s the fancy broad? THOR My mother. She dies today. ROCKET Oh, jeez. Thor starts to sweat. THOR I can’t do this. This is a bad idea. I can’t do this... Rocket climbs onto a marble monument. ROCKET Come here.  (MORE)  Thor steps closer. ROCKET SLAPS HIM ACROSS THE FACE. ROCKET (CONT'D) You think you’re the only one who’s lost people? What do you think we’re doing here? I lost the only family I ever had. Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna. All gone. I’ve lived five meaningless years without them, and every minute has blown Aaskvarian gornads. I get you miss your mom. But she’s gone. Really gone. There are plenty of people who are only kind of gone. And you can help them. So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard, make shmoopy talk to Prettypants, and when she’s not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone, and help me get my family back? Thor stares at him a long moment. He wipes his tears away. THOR I guess not. ROCKET Good. THOR Thank you. I can do this. ROCKET Great. As Rocket scurries to Jane’s door, Thor murmurs to himself. THOR I can do this...I can do this... (beat) I can’t do this... ROCKET (peering through keyhole) All right, heartbreaker. This is our shot... Rocket turns to find...THOR NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. ROCKET (CONT'D) Thor? (holding his temples) (MORE)  ROCKET (CONT'D)  I can kill him, and say the Elves did it. EXT. MORAG - DAY (GUARDIANS) TITLE: MORAG,  STIFF WINDS PELT THE SURFACE OF MORAG.

TONY (INTO COM) Cap, I’ve got to say that outfit does nothing for your ass. STEVE (OVER COM) No one asked you to look, Tony. REVEAL TINY SCOTT ON TONY’S SHOULDER. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) I think you look great, Cap. As far as I’m concerned, that’s America’s ass. A1 NATASHA Who gets the magic wand? A1 STEVE SHIELD’s coming up now. TONY Ball’s in play.

Sitwell carries the scepter to THE SERVICE ELEVATOR...WHERE A STRIKE TEAM WAITS. BROCK RUMLOW hits “down.” BROCK RUMLOW We promise to be extra careful. Scott stares at Sitwell and Rumlow. SCOTT LANG Who are these guys? TONY SHIELD. Actually, Hydra. But we didn’t know that yet. SCOTT LANG Seriously? ‘Cause it’s kind of obvious they’re bad guys. TONY You’re small but you’re talking loud. A1 THOR WALKS LOKI PAST A1 STEVE. A1 STEVE (INTO COM) I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue. Loki rolls his eyes...AND TRANSFORMS INTO A COPY OF STEVE. LOKI/STEVE “I’m on my way down to coordinate search and rescue.” I mean, really, how do you keep your food down? Thor slaps A MUZZLE on Loki, who REVERTS TO HIS OWN FORM. A1 THOR Yes, that’s much better. He steers his brother into THE MAIN ELEVATOR. A1 THOR (CONT'D) You coming, Stark?   Nearby, A1 TONY uses his gauntleted hand to place THE TESSERACT into AN ALUMINUM ATTACHE CASE. A1 TONY One sec, just packing my lunch. TONY All right, you’re up, Little Buddy. There’s our stone A1 Tony crosses to the elevator. Scott takes position, readying himself. SCOTT LANG All right. Flick me. Tony flicks Scott with a finger, sending him sailing into the ATTACHE CASE.

The doors close. Everyone rides in silence. Tension mounts. STEVE (CONT'D) I got a call from the Secretary’s office. I’m going to be running point on the scepter. Behind him, Sitwell and Rumlow exchange a glance. AGENT SITWELL Sir? I don’t understandSTEVE We’ve had word there might be an attempt to steal it.

He’s the guy behind the guys behind Fury, so don’t mess. ALEXANDER PIERCE My friends call me Mr. Secretary. (to Thor) I have to ask you to turn the prisoner over to me. A1 THOR Loki will answer to Odin, himself. ALEXANDER PIERCE No, he’ll answer to us. “Odin” can have what’s left. (to Tony) And we’ll need the case back, too.

SCOTT LANG Here goes... SCOTT YANKS THE WIRE OUT OF ITS SOCKET. IN THE LOBBY, A1 TONY GRIPS HIS CHEST. ALEXANDER PIERCE Stark? A1 Tony SEIZES, dropping. THE TESSERACT CASE CLATTERS TO THE GROUND. PIERCE and A1 THOR kneel to assist. ALEXANDER PIERCE (CONT'D) MEDIC! A1 THOR Stark? Somebody get some help! Is it your chest machine? THE LOBBY BUZZES, SHIELD AGENTS RUNNING EVERYWHERE. In the bustle, SCOTT SLIDES OUT OF A1 TONY’S SLEEVE. He SHOVES THE TESSERACT CASE HARD. It SPINS across the floor... RIGHT INTO TONY’S HAND. Tony walks toward a side door.   TONY (INTO COM) Meet me in the alley. I’m just gonna grab a slice at Famous Ray’sBUT AS TONY PASSES THE STAIRWELL DOOR...HULK BANGS IT OPEN, SMASHING TONY IN THE FACE, SENDING HIM TUMBLING.

A1 STEVE (INTO COM) Disregard. I have eyes on Loki, Fourteenth Floor.   STEVE GENTLY LAYS THE SCEPTER DOWN, AND PULLS OFF HIS SHIELD. STEVE I’m not Loki. And I don’t want to hurt you. A1 STEVE PULLS HIS SHIELD OFF HIS BACK. A1 STEVE You’re not going to get the chanceA1 STEVE KICKS STEVE IN THE FACE. Steve stumbles. STEVE Forgot about that one. They grapple. Both their shields fall to the ground... THEY BOTH STAMP ON THEM, simultaneously flipping the shields back to their arms. A1 Steve looks impressed. A1 STEVE SWINGS. STEVE DUCKS, HAMMERING HIM. A1 Steve wipes the blood from his lip, squaring off. A1 STEVE I can do this all daySTEVE Yeah, I know... They battle on. A1 Steve tackles Steve, knocking his shield aside, RIPPING OPEN ONE OF STEVE’S BELT COMPARTMENTS: THE COMPASS FALLS OUT, OPENING TO REVEAL PEGGY’S PICTURE. A1 Steve goes cold. He picks up the compass, FLABBERGASTED. A1 STEVE Where’d you get this? STEVE PX. Camp Lehigh. 1943. A1 Steve stares at Steve, eyes narrowing. A1 STEVE You’ve got a lot of nerve.

THE ANCIENT ONE waters a rooftop garden. She looks to ASTRAL BANNER, who’s only just getting used to being see-through. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) But if I were to give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I’d be dooming my own. ASTRAL BANNER Yeah, with all due respect, I’m not sure the science supports that. ANCIENT ONE And yet, you’re the one currently standing in the middle of my hydrangeas. Banner looks down to see, indeed, he has phased through the middle of the hydrangeas. He steps out of it. ASTRAL BANNER Lady, I just want to borrow your necklaceANCIENT ONE At what cost? SHE CONJURES A MAGICAL PROJECTION OF THE INFINITY STONES, SPINNING IN UNISON. A TUNNEL OF GOLDEN LIGHT POURS FORTH. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) The Infinity Stones create the experience you know as the flow of time. Remove one of the stones, and the flow splits. She plucks the GREEN TIME STONE out of the array: A SMALLER, BLACKENED RIVER BRANCHES OFF FROM THE FIRST.  (MORE)  ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Now, your timeline might benefit. My new one...would definitely not. SHE GESTURES. OUR CAMERA ZOOMS INTO THE BLACKENED TUNNEL... TUNNEL POV: HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE RUN AS WE FLY OVER A CROWDED STREET, UP TO...THE BURNING HONG KONG SANCTUM. ANCIENT ONE (O.S.) (CONT'D) In this new branch reality, without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness, our world would be overrun... MOVE UP TO SEE DORMAMMU IN THE SKY. HE OPENS HIS MOUTH... BACK ON THE ROOF...THE ANCIENT ONE PLUCKS MORE STONES FROM THE GOLDEN RIVER, CREATING FIVE MORE BLACKENED TRIBUTARIES. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) For each stone you remove, you’ll create a new, vulnerable timeline. Millions will suffer. (beat) Now tell me, Doctor. Can your science prevent all that? ASTRAL BANNER No. But it can erase it. Astral Banner reaches in and grabs THE VIRTUAL TIME STONE. ASTRAL BANNER (CONT'D) Because once we’re done with the stones, we can return each one to its own timeline. At the moment it was taken. So chronologically, in that reality, the stone never left. HE PUTS THE TIME STONE BACK. THE BLACK TIMELINE DISAPPEARS. ANCIENT ONE You’re leaving out the most important part, though. In order to put the stones back, you’d have to survive. ASTRAL BANNER We will. I will. I promise. ANCIENT ONE I can’t risk this reality on a promise. (MORE)  ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D)  It is the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time StoneASTRAL BANNER Yeah? Then why the hell did Strange give it away? The Ancient One freezes. ANCIENT ONE What did you say? ASTRAL BANNER Strange gave Thanos the Time Stone. ANCIENT ONE Willingly? Why? ASTRAL BANNER Don’t know. Maybe he made a mistake. ANCIENT ONE Or I did. The Ancient One looks out over a recovering NYC. ANCIENT ONE (CONT'D) Strange is meant to be the best of us. ASTRAL BANNER Then he must have had a reason. ANCIENT ONE I fear you may be right... Finally, she waves her hand and...WHOOSH! HE REINTEGRATES INTO THE SMART HULK BODY. Smart Hulk gets up, WOOZY. SHE REMOVES THE TIME STONE FROM THE EYE, HANDING IT TO HIM. SMART HULK Thank you.

EBONY MAW ZOOMS IN, REVEALING...A REFLECTION OF NEBULA. GAMORA I don’t understand. Two Nebulas? Thanos walks into the hologram, studying the faces. THANOS No. The same Nebula. From two different times. (to Ebony Maw) Set course for Morag. And scan the duplicate’s memories. (beat) I want to see everything...   INT.

FRIGGA You’re better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. (re. his bathrobe) What are you wearing? THOR I always wear this. It’s one of my favorites. FRIGGA And what’s wrong with your eye? THOR Oh, that. You remember the...Battle of Harokin. I took a...broadsword to the face? He trails off, at a loss, staring at his dead mom. Frigga gently lays her hand on his cheek...READING HIM. FRIGGA Oh. You’re not the Thor I know at all, are you? THOR Yes, I amFRIGGA I was raised by witches, boy. I see with more than eyes, you know that. (eyeing him) I can see the future hasn’t been kind to you, has it? THOR I didn’t say I was from the future...   FRIGGA Thor... Frigga gives her son a stern, “don’t lie to me” look. Thor stares at his mom a long moment. Then, he cracks: THOR I’m totally from the future. FRIGGA Yes, you are. THOR I need to talk to you. FRIGGA We can talk.

Seeking counsel from the smartest person in Asgard? THOR Yeah, I guess. FRIGGA An idiot, no. A failure, absolutely.   THOR That’s a little harshFRIGGA Quite a colossal one, by the sound of it. THOR Okay, maybe just stop talking. FRIGGA And you know what that makes you? Just like everyone else. THOR I’m not supposed to be like everyone else, though. FRIGGA Everyone fails at “who they’re supposed to be,” Thor. The measure of a person, of a hero, is how well they succeed at being who they are. Thor stares at her, biting back emotions. THOR I’ve really missed you, Mum. INT. ASGARD, PALACE, CORRIDOR - DAY (THOR 2) ROCKET TEARS DOWN THE HALL, EXTRACTION DEVICE IN HAND. ROCKET I got it I got it I got it!

THOR I wish we had more timeFRIGGA This was a gift. Now, go be the man you’re meant to be. (beat) And eat a salad. Thor smiles. He and Rocket activate their time suits. ROCKET Three...twoTHOR No. Wait. THOR DRAMATICALLY HOLDS OUT HIS HAND. A long moment passes. ROCKET What am I looking at? FRIGGA Sometimes it takes a second. Then...MJOLNIR SAILS INTO HER SON’S HAND. She grins, proud. THOR (relieved) Still worthy. Mother and son look at each other for the last time. THOR (CONT'D) Goodbye, Mum. FRIGGA Goodbye, Son. THEN, WHOOSH! THOR AND ROCKET DISAPPEAR.

When the horizon finally settles...he sees A METAL MAN STANDING THERE WAITING FOR HIM. QUILL Oh, fuBAM! RHODEY DECKS QUILL IN THE FACE. Quill drops, out cold. RHODEY Sorry about that. I know you guys were teammates and everything. NEBULA Do you hear me complaining? Nebula rifles through Quill’s sack. She pulls out AN ELECTRONIC LOCK PICK. RHODEY What is that?

RHODEY I’m just saying, when you break into a place called, “The Temple of the Power Stone”, there are usually... Ahead, they see...THE POWER STONE ORB HOVERING ABOVE ITS PEDESTAL, SURROUNDED BY A WEB OF LASER THREADS. RHODEY (CONT'D) Traps and stuff. (Nebula steps inside) Okay, don’t say I didn’t warn you. Rhodey scans the laser web, strategizing. RHODEY (CONT'D) These are photovoltaic lasers on a constantly shifting matrix. Gonna be damn near impossible to neutralize unless weSUDDENLY, NEBULA REACHES HER CYBERNETIC ARM THROUGH THE WEB. SHE GRABS THE ORB...BUT THE WEB GRIPS HER, FRYING HER ARM. She pulls out the orb, but sees Rhodey staring at HER BLACKENED CLAW. NEBULA I wasn’t always like this. He sees actual emotion somewhere inside her. Favor his exoskeletal leg braces as he softens. RHODEY Yeah, me either. I guess we do the best with what we’ve got, huh? SHE HANDS HIM THE ORB WITH JUST THE GHOST OF A SMILE. RHODEY (CONT'D) Let’s get out of here. Place gives me the creeps.

We shot it. It was six stones or nothing! Six stonesTONY You’re not helpingSCOTT LANG You ruined the Time Heist! TONY Okay, okay, Loki’s from Asgard, he’s comfortable there. Knows the restaurants. It’s a safe bet he visits home. If we can just grab This-Thor and explain the situation, he and I can flySTEVE Loki could be anywhere in the universe. We’d be old men before we found him. As Steve and Scott debate, MOVE IN ON TONY, MIND WHIRLING... STEVE (CONT'D) What other options did we have on the Tesseract? SCOTT LANG Whoa, whoa. We don’t have any other options. We can’t go to any other times. No do-overs! We’ve only got one particle left, each. Use it now, that’s it, bye-bye, we don’t come home. STEVE But if we don’t try, nobody else comes home, either. TONY I got it! There’s another way to re-take the Tesseract, and acquire new particles. (to Steve) Military installation, Garden State. Steve eyes Tony, BEGINNING TO UNDERSTAND.   STEVE When were they both there? TONY I have a vaguely exact idea. STEVE How vague? SCOTT LANG Hang on, what’s in New Jersey? TONY I know they were there, and I know how I know. STEVE STUDIES TONY A LONG MOMENT... STEVE Looks like we’re improvising. SCOTT LANG Wait! What are you improvising? STEVE HANDS SCOTT THE STAFF. STEVE Scott, take this back to the Compound. TONY All right, suits on. Try these coordinates. 04-07-19-70... SCOTT LANG Steve- Cap- Captain America, if you do this and he’s wrong...you’re not coming back.

Steve nods at A MAN IN A GRAY SUIT approaching a building, “MUNITIONS.” He opens the door with a retro-tech PUNCH CARD.

HOWARD STARK Easy to rememberTONY Potts. HOWARD STARK I’m Howard Stark. (shaking hands) You seem a little green around the gills, Potts. Need some air? TONY That’d be swell.

TONY How far along is she? HOWARD STARK Gee, I suppose... (indicating) ...this far. She’s at the point where she can’t stand the sound of my chewing. So I guess I’ll be eating in the pantry again. TONY I have a little girl. TONY SMILES. He’s talking about the man-he’s-talking-to’s granddaughter, fifty years before she’s born. HOWARD STARK A girl would be nice. Less chance she’d turn out exactly like me. TONY Would that be so bad? HOWARD STARK Let’s just say the greater good hasn’t always outweighed my own self interest. The elevator doors open. INT.

You’ve never seen either of these men before? FEMALE SHIELD AGENT No. But I have an eye for this. Something looked fishy. M.P. Describe ‘fishy’. FEMALE SHIELD AGENT One of them had a hippie beard. M.P. We talking Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? FEMALE SHIELD AGENT Definitely Mungo Jerry. M.P. (over walkie-talkie) This is Chesler. We need every available agent to sub-level 6. We have a potential breach. Steve ducks through the nearest door... INT. CAMP LEHIGH, SHIELD FACILITY, PEGGY’S OFC. - DAY (1970) Steve enters a darkened office. A glass wall separates it from another bullpen. Then he sees something on the desk. He stares, stunned, at two photos: one features PEGGY CARTER STANDING WITH JFK. THE OTHER IS OF SKINNY STEVE. Steve turns the desk nameplate around: “MARGARET CARTER.” Steve realizes that even twenty-five years later, Peggy never forgot about him. Just then, THE BULLPEN DOOR FLIES OPEN. LIGHTS SNAP ON, revealing PEGGY CARTER (49), talking to someone in the hall. PEGGY CARTER So, send them in. MALE AGENT They’re trying, ma’am, but Braddock’s unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. PEGGY CARTER Oh, for the love of- I’ll find the weather projections. You call Braddock and tell him to shelter in place. Assuming he’s bright enough to come out of the rain. MALE AGENT (O.S.) Yes, ma’am. Steve stares at her from the darkness, STUNNED. Peggy rifles through a file cabinet. PEGGY CARTER Here we are... She flips through a file, reading. In the darkness behind her, Steve approaches. Peggy reads something disturbing. PEGGY CARTER (CONT'D) Crikey O’Reilly. (calling out) Sergeant? Hang up and call Air Command. Braddock needs back up, immediately. MALE AGENT Ma’am? PEGGY CARTER Those aren’t lightning strikes he’s looking at... She slaps the file closed and hurries out. Steve stares after her a long moment. EXT. CAMP LEHIGH - DAY (1970) Howard and Tony approach a WAITING LIMO. TONY Got any names, yet? HOWARD STARK If it’s a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. TONY You might let that stew a while. You’ve got time. HOWARD STARK What are you, couple years older than me? TONY Yeah. I guess. HOWARD STARK Let me ask you a question. When your kid was born...were you nervous? TONY Wildly. HOWARD STARK Did you feel qualified? Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? TONY I pieced it together as I went along. I thought about what my dad did... HOWARD STARK My old man never met a problem he couldn’t solve with a belt. TONY I tried to hold onto the good stuff. Dad dropped the odd pearl, here and there. HOWARD STARK Like what? TONY “No amount of money ever bought a second of time.” HOWARD STARK That’s good. Smart guy. TONY He did his best.  HOWARD STARK I tell you, this kid’s not even here yet, but there’s nothing I wouldn’t do for him. Tony takes this in, GRATIFIED. Just then...EDWIN JARVIS (56) opens the limo door. HOWARD STARK (CONT'D) Besides, if I fall down on the fathering job, old Jarvis is ready to pick up the slack. Isn’t that right? EDWIN JARVIS Indeed, sir. I shall endeavor to teach the lad the rudiments of judo. Tony smiles at his old friend. As Jarvis gets in the car, Tony notices...STEVE WAITING BEHIND A JEEP. TIME TO GO. Howard turns to shake Tony’s hand. HOWARD STARK Well, good to meet you, Potts. TONY You’re going to do fine, Howard. HOWARD STARK Thanks. See you around? TONY Count on it...

SKULL POINTS A BONY FINGER DOWN THE WELL. RED SKULL (CONT'D) A soul for a soul. Natasha and Clint stare down the well, stunned. TIME CUT: RED SKULL STARES DOWN THE WELL, robes whipping in the wind. CLINT BARTON (O.S.) Maybe he’s full of shit. FIFTY FEET AWAY, AT THE MONOLITHS, NATASHA AND CLINT HUDDLE. NATASHA I don’t think so. CLINT BARTON Why, because he knew your daddy’s name? NATASHA I didn’t. (off his look) Thanos left here with the stone, and without his daughter. You really think that’s a coincidence? They both look out at the well, heavy. NATASHA (CONT'D) (under her breath) Whatever it takes... CLINT BARTON (under his breath) Whatever it takes... Natasha goes to Clint, resolved. NATASHA If we don’t get the stone, billions of people are going to stay dead. CLINT BARTON Then I guess we both know who it has to be. NATASHA Yeah. Guess we do. They take each other’s hand. A long goodbye beat. Except... CLINT BARTON I’m starting to think we don’t mean the same person. NATASHA For the last five years, I’ve been trying to do one thing -- get to right here. This is all it’s been about. Bringing everybody back. CLINT BARTON Do not get all decent on meNATASHA You think I want to do it? I’m trying to save your life, you idiotCLINT BARTON And I don’t want you to. (beat) Nat. You know what I’ve done. What I am now.

Clint squeezes away tears. CLINT BARTON We can’t get her back. THOR What’s he talking about? Of course, we can. CLINT BARTON It can’t be undone. That’s why. THOR No offense, but you’re...a very earthly being. We’re talking about space magic, here. “Can’t” seems a little definitive, don’t you think? CLINT BARTON Well, I know I’m a little outside my pay grade here, but, she still isn’t here, is she? THOR That’s my pointCLINT BARTON It can’t be undone. At least that’s what the red, floating guy said. But why don’t you go talk to him, okay? Why don’t you grab your hammer and fly to that place and talk to him. IT CAN’T BE UNDONE.

FINALLY, SMART HULK HOLDS UP THE GAUNTLET. SMART HULK (under his breath) Everybody’s coming home... HE SLOWLY SLIPS HIS HAND IN THE GLOVE. SUDDENLY, HE SPASMS, TAKING IN THE POWER AS THANOS DID IN ML1. HE STRUGGLES. THOR What’s happening? Take it off, take if off! STEVE Bruce, you okay? TONY Talk to me, Banner.  SMART HULK I’m...okay... THEN SMART HULK REACHES OUT HIS HAND...AND SNAPS HIS FINGERS. CRAAAACK! THE STONES FLARE. A BRIGHT SURGE OF ENERGY RACES UP SMART HULK’S ARM. HE ROARS AS HIS EYES BLAZE GREEN. A BLAST WHITES OUT THE SCREEN. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, HANGAR - DAY NEBULA studies THE QUANTUM CONSOLE. She takes off her glove, revealing A PERFECTLY INTACT ARM. THIS IS BAD NEBULA. SHE OPENS A PANEL IN HER ARM, SNAKES OUT A CABLE...AND JACKS INTO THE CONSOLE. THE QUANTUM TUNNEL boots up. AS SHE HURRIES AWAY... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY FROM HIGH OVERHEAD, WE SEE THE TIME ENERGY SIGNATURE SHOOT FROM THE HANGAR. AN OMINOUS RIPPLE WARPS ACROSS THE SKY... INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, WORKSHOP - DAY WHOOSH! EVERYTHING COMES BACK INTO VIEW. THE GAUNTLET FALLS OFF, ROLLING ACROSS THE FLOOR. SMART HULK COLLAPSES, ARM WITHERED, SIDE BURNT BLACK. EVERYONE RUSHES OVER. Steve checks Smart Hulk’s pulse. STEVE Bruce! TONY Don’t move him! Then THE BLAST DOORS OPEN, revealing the sound of...CHIRPING. SCOTT walks toward the courtyard. Smart Hulk’s eyes clear. He grasps Steve’s arm. SMART HULK Did it work? They pause, as if it only just now occurred to them. JUST THEN...A CELL PHONE BUZZES. A STUNNED CLINT TURNS AND APPROACHES HIS PHONE. On the home screen, we see A PHOTO OF HIS WIFE: “LAURA CALLING.” CLINT FINALLY PUTS THE PHONE TO HIS EAR. CLINT BARTON Honey? AT THE WINDOW, SCOTT STARES AT A BIRD FEEDER. DOZENS OF CARDINALS AND FINCHES NIBBLE ON THE SEED. SCOTT LANG Guys, I think itBOOM! THE BUILDING EXPLODES. DEBRIS SWALLOWS THE CAMERA. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND - DAY A MUSHROOM CLOUD BILLOWS OVER AVENGERS COMPOUND. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Nothing moves. The smoke clears, revealing...A BOMBED OUT CRATER A MILE WIDE. Avengers Compound has been destroyed. Then the light changes...AND THE SANCTUARY-2 parts the clouds. It hovers over the ruins like a vulture. AN ENERGY BEAM drops to the ground, releasing... THANOS, FLANKED BY A SQUAD OF OUTRIDERS. The Mad Titan looks around at the devastation he has wrought. THANOS (INTO COM) Daughter? BAD NEBULA (OVER COM) Yes, father... OUT OF THE SMOKE WALKS ”BAD” NEBULA. Bruised and dirty. THANOS So this is the future. Well done. She tears off THE ORANGE HEAD-PLATE. BAD NEBULA Thank you, Father. They suspected nothing. THANOS The arrogant never do.  Thanos takes off his helmet, staring up at the crater’s edge. THANOS (CONT'D) Go. Find the stones. Bring them to me. BAD NEBULA What will you do? THANOS Wait. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY THE UNDERGROUND GARAGE LIES HALF-COLLAPSED. SMART HULK GRITS HIS TEETH, HOLDING UP THE CEILING WITH ONE GOOD ARM, HIS OTHER ARM BURNED AND LIFELESS. BELOW... RHODEY LIES IN THE RUBBLE, WAR MACHINE SUIT SPARKING. RHODEY Canopy! Canopy! Rhodey’s suit RATCHETS OPEN. HE HAULS HIMSELF FREE to see...ROCKET TRAPPED UNDER RUBBLE. AS HE CRAWLS TO HIM... THE CEILING RUMBLES. SMART HULK WAVERS, MUSCLES QUIVERING. RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Tony. Cap. Does anybody hear me?! HE FINALLY REACHES ROCKET. Rocket wheezes, in pain. RHODEY (CONT'D) Hang on! RHODEY WEDGES A PIECE OF REBAR INTO THE DEBRIS. HE HEAVES, finally managing to lever it off of Rocket. THEN... THE CRACKED CEILING GIVES WAY. A MILLION GALLONS OF RIVER WATER RUSH IN. RHODEY TRIES TO KEEP HIS HEAD ABOVE WATER. RHODEY (INTO COM) (CONT'D) Mayday! Mayday! We are taking on water! INT. TOOL SHOP, RUINS - DAY CLOSE ON SCOTT LANG lying on a SILVER, METAL FLOOR.  RHODEY (OVER COM) ...anyone...Mayday...MaydayScott groans, coming to. SCOTT LANG Wait, what...? REVEAL, TINY SCOTT LYING IN THE RUINS OF THE ARMORY...ON THE IRON PATRIOT HELMET. ROCKET (OVER COM) Tell ‘em to...hurry...asses upRHODEY (OVER COM) ...trapped...drowning...no time... Scott jumps to his feet. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) No! Wait, I’m here! Scott spots WATER TRICKLING THROUGH THE CRACKED FLOOR. INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY WATER DRIPS FROM A HOLE IN THE ROOF OF AN ACCESS TUNNEL...ONTO CLINT BARTON, LYING FACEDOWN. He groans. He opens his hand to find HIS CELLPHONE: HIS WIFE SMILES ON THE SCREEN. “LAURA, ONE MISSED CALL.” Clint stares, amazed. He winces, finding he’s been lying atop...THE GAUNTLET. It’s bashed out of shape, BUT ALL SIX STONES STILL GLEAM. CLINT BARTON (INTO COM) Cap? Stark? Anyone? STATIC. Then, he hears...A SCRAPING SOUND, TALONS ON CEMENT. He peers down a darkened tunnel, then unshoulders his bow. HE LOOSES A FLARE ARROW, revealing... DOZENS OF OUTRIDERS SCRABBLING ALONG THE WALLS AND CEILING. CLINT GRABS THE GAUNTLET AND RUNS. THE CREATURES GIVE CHASE. INT./EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, LAB, RUINS - DAY FIRES SMOULDER BENEATH THE COLLAPSED CEILING. MOVE THROUGH SMOKE TO FIND...STEVE, out cold. SOMEONE SHAKES HIM. He wakes to see TONY, HOLDING HIS SHIELD. TONY You lose this again, I’m keeping it. STEVE What happened? TONY Told you. We messed with time. Time messed back. Woozy, Steve follows Tony through the ruins of the lab. STEVE Where are the others? TONY I read life signs, maybe 800 feet down, but it’s hard to tell. They reach the edge of the crater where THOR LOOKS DOWN AT...THANOS. Sitting on a rock. Waiting. TONY (CONT'D) What’s he been doing? THOR Absolutely nothing. The three of them stare a long moment. Then, as if sensing them, Thanos turns his head...AND LOOKS THEIR WAY. STEVE Son of a bitch. TONY Yeah. STEVE Where are the stones? TONY Somewhere under all of this. All I know is...he doesn’t have ‘em. STEVE So we keep it that way. That lands. This is their chance. THOR You know it’s a trap. TONY DEPLOYS HIS ARMOR.  (MORE)  TONY Don’t think I care. THOR Just so we’re all in agreement. Thor holds out his hand: MJOLNIR FLIES INTO IT. He holds out his other hand: STORMBREAKER SLAPS INTO HIS PALM. CRACK! LIGHTNING STRIKES AS HE’S COVERED IN CAPE AND ARMOR. THOR (CONT'D) Let’s kill him properly this time. STEVE TIGHTENS HIS SHIELD, LEADING THEM INTO THE CRATER... EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Thanos sits on his rock, contemplative. THANOS You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Right back to me. TONY APPROACHES, WARY, AS IF SNEAKING UP ON A RABID DOG. STEVE AND THOR FAN OUT ON EITHER SIDE. THANOS (CONT'D) I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But you’ve shown me that’s impossible. (beat) Life clings to the past with bloody fingernails. As long as there are those who remember what was, there will be those unable to accept what can be. They will resist. TONY Yep. We’re all kinds of stubborn. THANOS I’m thankful. Because now I know what I must do. Thanos reaches for his helmet. THANOS (CONT'D) I will shred this universe down to its last atom. (MORE)  THANOS (CONT'D)And then, with the stones you’ve collected for me, create a new one, teeming with life that knows not what it has lost, but only what it has been given. A grateful universe. STEVE Born out of blood. Thanos studies Steve as if seeing him for the first time. THANOS They’ll never know it. THANOS DRAWS A BLADE OFF HIS BACK, TOWERING OVER THEM. THANOS (CONT'D) Because you won’t be alive to tell them. Tony glances over at Steve. Ready? Steve nods... JUST AS THOR CHARGES THANOS. WHAM! ALL THREE AVENGERS ATTACK, USING THEIR SKILLS IN CONCERT. THANOS STUMBLES, ON HIS HEELS. THE HEROES PUNISH HIM, RELENTLESS. PULL UP THROUGH THE HAZE, TO THE SANCTUARY-2... INT. SANCTUARY-2, INTERROGATION CELL - DAY NEBULA huddles alone in A PRISON CELL. After a beat...THE DOORS RATCHET OPEN. She stares into the shadows. NEBULA What do you want? GAMORA STEPS INTO THE CELL. THE TWO SISTERS FROM DIFFERENT ERAS STARE AT EACH OTHER. GAMORA In the future...what happens to you and me? NEBULA I try to kill you. Several times. But, eventually...we become friends. We become sisters. GAMORA That’s hard to believe. THANOS (CONT'D)  NEBULA A lot of things that happen will be hard to believe. Gamora nearly smiles. She takes a long look at Nebula. Finally...SHE HOLDS OUT HER HAND. GAMORA Come on. We can still stop him. Nebula takes a deciding moment. Then SHE GRABS GAMORA’S HAND. One sister pulls the other to her feet. INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY SMART HULK STRAINS AGAINST THE CEILING. RHODEY HANGS ONTO A PIPE AS THE WATER RISES. SMART HULK Rhodey. Rocket. Get out of here. Save yourselves. ROCKET SURFACES FROM BELOW, GASPING. ROCKET No good. Couldn’t even...find a hole...small enough to abandon you through. Suddenly, Smart Hulk snarls in pain as THE CEILING DROPS A FOOT. His legs buckle as he struggles against the weight. Finally he sets his jaw...AND STRAIGHTENS HIS LEGS. SMART HULK AAARRRGH! EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - CONTINUOUS THE BUILDING RIGHTS ITSELF, LEVELING OUT. INT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY A RAGING RIVER ROARS THROUGH THE RUINS. AFTER A BEAT...SCOTT LANG ZOOMS PAST, RIDING A PLASTIC BOTTLE CAP. RHODEY (OVER COM) MAYDAY! MAYDAY! SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) HANG ON! I’M COMING!  INT. ACCESS TUNNEL - DAY SHRIEKING OUTRIDERS CHASE BARTON THROUGH THE TUNNELS. CLINT AFFIXES ARROW-CHARGES TO THE WALLS AS HE RUNS. Just as the Outriders are about to overtake him, Clint hits a button on his bow, DETONATING THE CHARGES... BRINGING THE ROOF DOWN ON TOP OF THE OUTRIDERS. Clint rolls, coming up directly underneath A VERTICAL SHAFT. A cluster of Outriders escape the collapse, lunging for him. Clint shoots a grappling arrow up the shaft, ascending...BUT SO DO THE OUTRIDERS, skittering up the sides. Clint draws his katana, slashing the aliens just as... INT. ACCESS TUNNEL, UPPER CHAMBERS - CONTINUOUS HE TUMBLES INTO THE UPPER CHAMBER. He gasps, safe. Then he looks up to see (BAD) NEBULA, LOOMING OVER HIM. CLINT BARTON Oh, hey. I know you. She gently takes the Gauntlet. BAD NEBULA (INTO COM) Father. I have the stones. CLINT BARTON WhatClint tries to get up, but Nebula puts a boot in his chest and A BLASTER TO HIS HEAD... GAMORA (O.S.) Stop. COVERING CLINT, BAD NEBULA TURNS TO SEE...GAMORA, GUN RAISED. BAD NEBULA You’re betraying us? GAMORA Not you. GOOD NEBULA steps from the shadows, hands raised, placating. Bad Nebula stares at her future self.  NEBULA You don’t have to do this. BAD NEBULA I am this. GAMORA No. You’re not. Good Nebula takes a tiny step forward. She taps her head. NEBULA You’ve seen what we becomeGAMORA Sister, listen to herBAD NEBULA Shut up. You’re a traitor! NEBULA You can change. Bad Nebula struggles, her face a twisted grimace. BAD NEBULA He won’t let me. BAD NEBULA FIRES AT GAMORA, JUST AS GOOD NEBULA DRAWS A GUN AND SHOOTS HER DOWN. BAD NEBULA DROPS. Good Nebula stares at her dead younger self, conflicted. Clint picks up the gauntlet, very confused. CLINT BARTON I’m not even gonna ask. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY TONY’S HUD: TONY GLARES RIGHT AT US, AS... THOR SMASHES HIS HAMMERS TOGETHER, HURLING LIGHTNING INTO THE BACK OF THE IRON MAN SUIT. TONY SENDS THE RESULTING OVERLOAD AT THANOS...BUT THANOS PROPELLERS HIS BLADE, HOLDING BACK THE BLAST. THOR USES STORMBREAKER TO BAT MJOLNIR AT THANOS... THANOS SNATCHES TONY BY THE ANKLE AND USES HIM AS A SHIELD AGAINST THE ONCOMING HAMMER. WHACK! MJOLNIR PLOWS INTO THE DIRT. TONY GOES TUMBLING, OUT COLD. TONY’S HUD: FRIDAY TRIES TO REVIVE HIM. FRIDAY (O.S.) Boss? Wake up! INT. UNDERGROUND GARAGE, RUINS - DAY ROCKET, RHODEY, AND SMART HULK GULP AIR, INCHES FROM THE CEILING, FACING THE END. RHODEY GLANCES OVER AT SMART HULK. RHODEY See you on the other side, man. They take a last breath, THEN THE WATER HITS THE CEILING. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY Steve slashes at Thanos. The Titan brutally bats him aside. Thor attacks, but Thanos drives him through walls of debris. THANOS SMASHES HIS FIST INTO THOR’S FACE, OVER AND OVER. Thor calls for Stormbreaker, but Thanos intercepts it. He presses the blade into Thor’s chest, trying to drive it home. Then, across the field...MJOLNIR RISES INTO THE AIR. THANOS GRINS, ABOUT TO FINISH THOR OFF, WHEN...MJOLNIR FLIES IN, KNOCKING THE AXE OUT OF HIS HAND. Follow the hammer as it flies back to the only other man worthy enough to wield it...STEVE ROGERS. Half-conscious, THOR SEES STEVE HOLDING MJOLNIR. THOR I...knew...it... STEVE ATTACKS, CRACKING THANOS IN THE JAW. THANOS TUMBLES. BEFORE THE TITAN CAN GET UP, STEVE CALLS DOWN THE LIGHTNING AND SENDS IT CRACKLING INTO THANOS’ BODY. Steve leaps, trying to finish Thanos off...BUT THANOS ROLLS ASIDE, HEAD-BUTTING STEVE BACKWARDS. THANOS GETS TO HIS FEET, A FAINT SMILE ON HIS FACE. HE WHIPS OFF HIS HELMET AND ATTACKS STEVE WITH HIS BLADE. BLOW AFTER BLOW. IT’S ALL STEVE CAN DO TO GET HIS SHIELD UP.  THANOS HACKS THE SHIELD TO PIECES, FINALLY KNOCKING STEVE ACROSS THE FIELD. Steve lies beaten, half a shield still attached to his arm. THANOS In all my years of conquest... Thanos looks out at the tiny human struggling to stand. THANOS (CONT'D) Of violence and slaughter...it was never personal. Thanos gestures behind him as A RUMBLE ECHOES. THOUSANDS OF ALIENS RING THE LIP OF THE CRATER: THE BLACK ORDER LEADS A PLATOON OF CHITAURI, SAKAARANS, AND OUTRIDERS. THANOS (CONT'D) But I’ll tell you now, the things I’m about to do to your stubborn, annoying, little planet... Q-SHIPS, DROPSHIPS, NECROCRAFT, AND LEVIATHANS BUZZ ABOVE. THANOS (CONT'D) I’m going to enjoy it. Very, very much. Steve stares at Thanos and his army. And even in the face of such overwhelming odds...he gets to his feet. THANOS stares, almost sad, as Steve tightens the broken shield on his arm...AND STARTS WALKING TOWARD HIM. One man against thousands. All alone. But just then, Steve’s COM CRACKLES. He strains to hear. The com crackles again. We can make out A MUFFLED VOICE. MUFFLED VOICE (ON COM) -ap-...-comin-...-otSteve shakes his head, trying to clear it. Slowly, SOUND RETURNS...AND THE WORDS RING CLEAR: SAM WILSON (O.S.) Cap. On your left. PULL BACK...TO SEE A PORTAL OPENING IN THE DISTANCE. OUT OF IT FLIES...SAM WILSON. Steve watches Sam soar over the field, then turns AS EVEN MORE PORTALS OPEN. FROM ONE: DR. STRANGE, PETER QUILL, DRAX, MANTIS, PETER PARKER...AND KRAGLIN AND THE RAVAGERS. FROM ANOTHER: T’CHALLA, OKOYE, SHURI, M’BAKU, WANDA, BUCKY, GROOT...AND THE WAKANDAN ARMY. FROM A THIRD: VALKYRIE, KORG, MIEK...AND AN ASGARDIAN ARMY. FROM A FOURTH: PEPPER POTTS (IN RESCUE ARMOR), HOPE VAN DYNE, AND WONG LEADING A SQUAD OF SORCERERS. THOR gets to his feet, calling Stormbreaker to his hand as...TONY regains consciousness, staring out at the cavalry. Wong and Strange quickly find each other. DR. STRANGE Is that everyone? WONG You wanted more?! JUST THEN, THE GROUND SHAKES AND RUBBLE EXPLODES UPWARDS AS...GIANT-MAN BURSTS FROM BELOW. SCOTT LANG Top floor, everybody out! HE OPENS HIS HUGE HAND, RELEASING ROCKET, SMART HULK, AND RHODEY, NOW IN HIS COSMIC IRON PATRIOT ARMOR. STEVE TAKES IN HIS REINFORCEMENTS, THEN STARES OUT AT THANOS. PAN ACROSS OUR HEROES AS STEVE CALLS MJOLNIR TO HIS HAND. STEVE Avengers...assemble. THOR LETS LOOSE A BATTLE CRY AS HE CHARGES! EVERYONE FOLLOWS SUIT AS OUR HEROES FLOOD THE FIELD. ACROSS THE WAY, THANOS SMILES AND POINTS HIS BLADE. TWO MIGHTY ARMIES RACE TOWARD EACH OTHER UNTIL...CLASH! GIANT-MAN SLUGS A LEVIATHAN IN THE JAW. DRAX launches himself onto a CULL currently choking the life out of KORG.  TONY blasts overhead. RESCUE joins him. Together, they strafe the field. STEVE and THOR fight together. Both hold out their hands. Stormbreaker returns to Steve, Mjolnir to Thor, who frowns. THOR No. You take the little one. Elsewhere, TONY BATTLES SEVERAL CULLS. One knocks him into an Outrider, who’s about to rip his armor off when... THWIP. PETER PARKER webs the Outrider, yanking him into the path of...GIANT-MAN’S FOOT. SQUISH. Tony stares at Peter, emotional. They retract their helmets. PETER PARKER Mr. Stark. Holy cow, you would not believe what’s been going on. Do you remember when we were in space? And I got all dusty? I must’ve passed out, because I woke up and you weren’t there, but Dr. Strange was, and he was like, “it’s been five years, they need us.” And he started doing that yellow sparkly thing he doesBut Tony just wraps his arms around him, smashing Peter’s face into his chest plate. PETER PARKER (CONT'D) (muffled) Oh. This is nice. ACROSS THE FIELD...QUILL flies, firing down on Sakaaran soldiers. One leaps off an outcropping... TACKLING QUILL INTO A WRECKED FUSELAGE, WHERE ANOTHER SAKAARAN WAITS. Quill drops one, but the other raises his weapon to strike. THEN BLAM! The Sakaaran drops dead on top of Quill. He pushes the body off to see...GAMORA, BLASTER STILL SMOKING. Quill stares, amazed. QUILL Gamora? HE APPROACHES, OVERWHELMED, EMOTIONAL.  QUILL (CONT'D) I thought I lost you. He tenderly strokes her face...and she knees him in the nuts. Twice. He goes down, gasping. QUILL (CONT'D) You missed the first time...then you got ‘em both the second time. She stares down at him as...NEBULA JOINS HER. GAMORA This is the one? Seriously? NEBULA Your choices were him or a tree. ACROSS THE FIELD...CLINT RUNS WITH THE GAUNTLET, PURSUED BY A CHITAURI APE. Just before the ape tramples Clint... SAM WILSON SWOOPS IN, CUTTING THE CREATURE DOWN. Clint runs on. The heroes confer over coms. CLINT BARTON What do you want to do with this thing? STEVE Get those stones as far away as possible! SMART HULK No! We need to send them back where they came from. TONY There’s no way to send them back. Thanos destroyed our time machine. SCOTT LANG Hold on! (shrinking to normal size) That wasn’t our only time machine. He clicks the KEYS TO LUIS’ VAN. From a distance, we hear, “LA CUCARACHA.” Steve immediately gets it. STEVE Does anyone see an ugly, brown van out there? ABOVE, VALKYRIE SCANS THE FIELD FROM HER PEGASUS.  VALKYRIE Yeah. But you’re not going to like where it’s parked. LUIS’ VAN SITS SURROUNDED BY THOUSANDS OF ALIENS, DEEP BEHIND ENEMY LINES. STEVE SURVEYS THE FIELD: AN ARMY STANDS BETWEEN THEM AND THE VAN, AIR AND GROUND CHOKED WITH ENEMIES. TONY (INTO COM) Scott, how long do you need to get that thing working? SCOTT LANG Uh, maybe ten minutes. STEVE Get it started. We’ll get the stones to you. HOPE VAN DYNE We’re on it, Cap. SCOTT glances at her. Cap? THEY SHRINK DOWN AND FLY AWAY. TONY FLIES UP TO DR. STRANGE, HOVERING. TONY Doc. You said we win one in 14 million. Is this how it goes down? DR. STRANGE If I tell you what happens, it won’t happen. TONY You better be right. Tony rockets away. Strange coolly watches him go. ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW RUSHES TO THANOS. EBONY MAW Sire, the stones! THANOS TURNS TO SEE...CLINT FIGHTING THROUGH THE HORDE, CARRYING THE GAUNTLET. A CULL HAMMERS CLINT, BUT THEN...T’CHALLA SLASHES THE CULL. T’CHALLA Clint, give it to me. CLINT HANDS THE GAUNTLET TO T’CHALLA, WHO TUCKS IT AND RUNS. ACROSS THE FIELD...SCOTT AND HOPE FLY OVER A LONG PLATOON OF CHITAURI, TOWARD LUIS’ VAN. INT./EXT LUIS’ VAN - CONTINUOUS They GROW TO NORMAL SIZE in the front seat. Out the windshield, THANOS’ HORDE CHARGES AT THEIR FRIENDS. SCOTT LANG (digging around) Ignition’s broken. I’ll hotwire itHOPE VAN DYNE Wait, you know how to do that? Scott splices wires. Sparks fly. SCOTT LANG I was in prison. I know how to do a lot of things. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, CRATER - DAY T’CHALLA RACES THROUGH THE HORDE...BUT THEN THANOS KNOCKS HIM OFF HIS FEET. THE GAUNTLET GOES TUMBLING. AS THANOS MOVES IN ON T’CHALLA...ALL AROUND, WRECKAGE BEGINS TO FLOAT. THANOS LOOKS UP TO SEE... WANDA, HOVERING IN THE AIR, WAITING FOR HIM. WANDA You took everything from me. Thanos takes THE BLADE off his back. THANOS I don’t even know who you are. WANDA You will. WANDA UNLEASHES A STORM OF RED ENERGY, HURLING WRECKAGE AT HIM. AS THANOS FIGHTS HIS WAY THROUGH IT... T’CHALLA DIVES FOR THE FALLEN GAUNTLET. SUDDENLY...EBONY MAW MANIPULATES THE EARTH, PULLING THE GAUNTLET TOWARD HIM. T’CHALLA WRAPS HIMSELF AROUND THE GLOVE, GETTING DRAGGED.PETER PARKER (O.S.) I GOT IT! T’CHALLA TURNS TO SEE PETER WHIZZING PAST. HE HURLS THE GAUNTLET...THWIP! Peter snatches it out of the air. HE LANDS, ONLY TO FIND HIMSELF SURROUNDED BY OUTRIDERS. PETER PARKER (CONT'D) Activate instant kill! His robotic arms slash with expert precision. ACROSS THE FIELD...WANDA LIFTS THANOS INTO THE AIR, RIPS HIS ARMOR OFF IN PIECES, THEN SLAMS HIM BACK TO THE GROUND. Thanos groans, outmatched. THANOS (INTO COM) Rain fire. Wipe them all out. CORVUS GLAIVE FIGHTS GROOT. CORVUS GLAIVE But, sire, our troopsTHANOS (INTO COM) Just do it! HIGH ABOVE...THE SANCTUARY-2 DESCENDS, CANNONS OPENING UP. BELOW...WANDA looks up, raising a force field just as... THE SANCTUARY-2 FIRES DOWN WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS. SAKAARANS AND JABARI ALIKE GO FLYING AS EVERY SQUARE INCH GETS HIT. THE BARRAGE HAMMERS THE RIVERBANK. CRACKS FORM. PEPPER CUTS DOWN AN ALIEN, THEN SPOTS SOMETHING OFF SCREEN. PEPPER POTTS (INTO COM) Um, is anyone else seeing this? TONY, SMART HULK, AND GAMORA turn to see...WATER GUSHING AS THE RIVERBANK THREATENS TO COLLAPSE. SUDDENLY... STRANGE AND WONG CONJURE TWO HUGE RUNE SHIELDS TO SHORE UP THE BANK. MORE WIZARDS JOIN, CREATING A HUGE “RUNE LEVEE.” THE SANCTUARY-2 MAINTAINS ITS BARRAGE. ACROSS THE FIELD...STEVE spots PETER PARKER gradually being overwhelmed by Outriders.  PETER PARKER I got this...I got this...I don’t got this. STEVE Hey, Queens! Heads up! STEVE HURLS MJOLNIR OVER THE THRONG. PETER WEBS ON...LETTING THE HAMMER PULL HIM OUT OF DANGER. A MORTAR BLAST KNOCKS HIM OUT OF THE SKY, BUT PEPPER POTTS RESCUES HIM. PEPPER POTTS Hang on, kid. I’ve got you. She drags him above the fray, then tosses him to...VALKYRIE FLYING PAST. PETER PERCHES ATOP PEGASUS. PETER PARKER Hey, nice to meet you-aaaaarg! VALKYRIE SPURS INTO HIGH GEAR, DODGING CANNON FIRE... BUT NOT FAST ENOUGH. A BLAST KNOCKS PETER TO THE GROUND. HE GASPS, COVERED IN DEBRIS, STILL CLUTCHING THE GAUNTLET. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, THE RELENTLESS BARRAGE PINS DOWN OUR HEROES. ALL HOPE IS LOST. Rocket and Groot dive for cover. Groot wraps his branches around them both. ROCKET At least we’re going out together this time... SUDDENLY, EVERYTHING GOES SILENT. ROCKET PEERS OUT FROM COVER TO SEE...THE CANNONS SWIVELING UP TOWARD THE CLOUDS. SAM WILSON flies overhead. SAM WILSON What the hell is this? TONY’S HUD: TONY FLIES OVERHEAD, SEARCHING UPWARD. TONY Friday, what are they firing at? FRIDAY (O.S.) Something just entered the upper atmosphere.  Rocket looks up at...A COMET HEADING STRAIGHT FOR EARTH. GROOT (nervous) I am Groot. Rocket grins, knowing what’s coming. ROCKET Just wait for it. SUDDENLY, THE COMET VEERS...RIGHT TOWARD THE SHIP. BOOM! THE COMET TEARS THROUGH THE SANCTUARY-2, RIGHT OUT THE OTHER SIDE, REVEALING...CAROL DANVERS. ROCKET (CONT'D) Oh, yeah! CAROL GLOWS BRIGHTER AS SHE GOES BINARY, ROCKETING AGAIN THROUGH THE HULL. BOOM! THE SHIP LISTS, ENGINES EXPLODING. CAROL EYES THE BATTLEFIELD, EXHAUSTED, LIGHT FADING. STEVE (OVER COM) Danvers! We’re gonna need an assist down here! CAROL DANVERS (INTO COM) (under ragged breath) Roger...Rogers... INT. VAN - DAY Scott twists wires on the Quantum Tunnel, hotwiring it. SCOTT LANG (INTO COM) I’m almost there. Where’s the glove? EXT. CRATER - DAY CAROL LANDS IN FRONT OF A DAZED PETER PARKER, WHO STILL HOLDS THE GAUNTLET TIGHT. HE LOOKS UP, CONFUSED. PETER PARKER Uh, hey. I’m Peter Parker. CAROL DANVERS Hey, Peter Parker. You got something for me?  Peter hands it over, staring out at the approaching horde. PETER PARKER I don’t know how you’re gonna get it through all thatWANDA (O.S.) Don’t worry, kid... Peter turns to see... WANDA, OKOYE, GAMORA, NEBULA, VALKYRIE, HOPE, AND SHURI WAITING. Wanda’s hands begin to glow. OKOYE She’s got help. Carol glances at PEPPER and MANTIS, then tucks the gauntlet under her arm AND LEADS THEM OUT. AT THE RIDGE...Thanos spots THE WOMEN OF MARVEL BLASTING THROUGH HIS TROOPS. HE TRACKS THEIR PATH TO...THE VAN. SCOTT KICKS THE REAR DOORS OPEN, EXPOSING THE QUANTUM TUNNEL. SCOTT LANG Thirty seconds! Thanos understands immediately. HE GRABS PROXIMA’S SPEAR FROM HER, AND STARTS RUNNING... ACROSS THE FIELD...EBONY MAW SENDS WANDA TUMBLING, BUT SHURI BLASTS HIM OUT OF THE SKY. CULL OBSIDIAN HAMMERS VALKYRIE, BUT NEBULA TAKES HIM OUT. CAROL KEEPS GOING, GAUNTLET TUCKED UNDER HER ARM, GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER TO... THE VAN...WHERE THE QUANTUM TUNNEL BURSTS TO LIFE. ACROSS THE FIELD...GROUNDED HEROES LOOK UP TO SEE CAROL NOW JUST YARDS AWAY FROM THE GOAL. SHE PUTS HER HEAD DOWN, FLYING FOR ALL SHE’S WORTH. BUT JUST AS SHE REACHES THE GAPING VAN DOORS... THANOS THROWS THE SPEAR... BOOM! THE VAN EXPLODES, SENDING SCOTT AND CAROL FLYING, TAKING OUT SOME OF THE WIZARDS HOLDING BACK THE RIVER. THANOS CATCHES PROXIMA’S RETURNING SPEAR. TIME SLOWS AS...STEVE, THOR, AND TONY SPOT...THE GAUNTLET, LYING UNGUARDED IN THE DIRT. The problem is...SO DOES THANOS. TIME RESUMES AS...THEY ALL SCRAMBLE FOR THE STONES. THEY COLLIDE. THANOS SNATCHES UP THE GAUNTLET, KICKING THOR DOWN. THANOS KNOCKS TONY ASIDE, THEN SQUEEZES THE CRUSHED GAUNTLET, POPPING IT OPEN...JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO PUT HIS HAND INSIDE. STEVE LUNGES, BUT THANOS THROTTLES HIM. FINALLY CLEAR, THANOS SLIPS ON THE GAUNTLET. BUT BEFORE HE CAN SNAP... CAROL ARRIVES. SHE GRABS THE GLOVE, PREVENTING HIM FROM CLOSING HIS FIST. HE HEADBUTTS HER...BUT SHE DOESN’T MOVE. CAROL PRESSES THANOS DOWN, BUT BEFORE HE FALLS... THANOS PULLS THE POWER STONE FROM ITS HOUSING AND PUNCHES CAROL, SENDING HER FLYING. THE FIELD GOES QUIET. NOW, NOTHING STANDS IN THANOS’ WAY. Tony gets to his knees, realizing... The Avengers are going to lose. ACROSS THE FIELD...WATER STARTS TO SPILL INTO THE CRATER. STRANGE TRIES TO HOLD IT BACK...BUT IT’S A LOSING BATTLE. He looks to Tony... Tony meets his eye. And in that moment, all Strange can do is hold up a single finger. “One.” ACROSS THE FIELD...THANOS RETURNS THE POWER STONE TO THE GAUNTLET. JUST AS THE ENERGY SURGES THROUGH HIM... TONY LUNGES FOR THE GAUNTLET IN THANOS’ HAND, NANO-CLAMPING IT IN A VISE. THANOS KNOCKS HIM ASIDE. HE LIFTS HIS HAND IN THE AIR, TRIUMPHANT. THANOS I am...inevitable. THANOS SNAPS HIS FINGERS. But nothing happens. Confused, Thanos turns the glove over to find...THE STONES ARE GONE. He looks to see...TONY, NANO-PARTICLES SLIDING AND SHIFTING, FORMING A NEW GAUNTLET ON HIS OWN WRIST: COMPLETE WITH SIX INFINITY STONES. POWER SURGES THROUGH TONY, EXCRUCIATING, BUT HE STILL LIFTS HIS HAND... TONY And I...am Iron Man. SNAP! WHOOSH. THE TIDAL WAVE EVAPORATES INTO MIST. ALL AROUND THE FIELD, SAKAARANS AND OUTRIDERS FOLD IN ON THEMSELVES, ATOMS DISINTEGRATING. THANOS LOOKS AROUND, WATCHING HIS TROOPS DISAPPEAR. SHIPS VANISH FROM THE SKY. CULLS, CHITAURI, ALL BLOW AWAY... LEAVING THANOS STANDING ALONE. AFTER A LONG MOMENT, HE SITS DOWN ON A ROCK...AND ACCEPTS HIS FATE. He watches as... HIS ATOMS DISSOLVE. FINALLY, THANOS DISAPPEARS. ACROSS THE FIELD, QUILL turns to GAMORA...BUT FINDS HER GONE. QUILL Babe? Gamora? ACROSS THE FIELD...TONY STARK FALLS BACK AGAINST THE UPTURNED ROOTS OF A TREE, ARMOR SMOKING, ARM WITHERED AND BLACKENED. Dying. RHODEY RUSHES TO HIM, BUT WITH ONE LOOK, HE KNOWS IT’S TOO LATE. TONY EXHALES, ALMOST LETTING GO. Then... PETER PARKER lands, kneeling, taking Tony’s hand. PETER PARKER Mr. Stark...Tony...it’s okay, it’s okay...Mr. Stark, we won. You did it, sir... But Tony gazes past him. Rhodey puts his hand on Peter’s shoulder, guiding him away... AS PEPPER ARRIVES. She kneels, heartsick. PEPPER POTTS Hey, Friday, what’ve we got? FRIDAY (O.S.) Life functions critical. Pepper stares into her husband’s eyes...and knows.  (MORE) PEPPER POTTS Tony, look at me. We’re going to be okay... He stares at her, tears welling. I’m sorry. She touches his face, then leans in to kiss him. PEPPER POTTS (CONT'D) You can rest now. When she pulls back, she sees his eyes, fixed and glassy. Everything goes quiet. All around, OUR HEROES GATHER, the full weight of what’s happened dawning on them. Tony Stark is gone. FADE TO BLACK. EXT. HIGH SCHOOL NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT PETER PARKER enters a hallway teeming with students. He searches the crowd, finally finding...NED LEEDS. As they embrace... EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT Fireworks explode over the skyline of San Francisco. TONY (O.S.) Everybody wants a happy ending. But it doesn’t always roll that way. Maybe this time. On Cassie’s porch, SCOTT watches with HOPE and CASSIE, all of them grinning. EXT. BARTON HOME, FRONT PORCH - DAY TWO BIKES lean on the porch of THE BARTON FARM HOUSE. Then the front door opens...and COOPER and LILA BARTON step out. TONY (O.S.) I’m hoping if you play this back, it’s in celebration. (MORE)  TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) (MORE)  I hope families are reunited, I hope we get it back and something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. If there ever was such a thing. She looks up at...A QUINJET descending from the sky. EXT. WAKANDA - SUNSET ON THE PALACE BALCONY...T’CHALLA embraces his mother, RAMONDA. Shuri turns from them to the magnificent sunset. TONY (O.S.) God, what a world. Universe, now. If you’d told me ten years ago that we weren’t alone, let alone to this extent, I probably wouldn’t have been surprised. But come on... EXT BARTON HOME - DAY The Quinjet touches down. The rear jump door opens, revealing CLINT. He stares at Lila and Cooper, overwhelmed. TONY (O.S.) Who knew what epic forces of dark and light would come into play? For better or worse, that’s the reality our children get to grow up in. They throw themselves into his arms. He kisses their heads, tears in his eyes. Finally, he looks up to see... LAURA BARTON, beaming, tearful, holding THREE YEAR-OLD NATHANIEL’S HAND. Clint gathers them all into a hug. INT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LIVING ROOM - DAY A HOLOGRAM of TONY STARK projects from an IRON MAN HELMET on the table. TONY (O.S.) That’s why I thought I’d probably better record a little greeting, in the case of…an untimely death on my part. TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D) (MORE)  TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)  I mean, death at any time is untimely, but...this “time travel” thing we’re going to try to pull off tomorrow has me scratching my head about the “survivability” of it all. But that’s the hero gig, right? Part of the journey is the end. REVERSE to find PEPPER, MORGAN, HAPPY HOGAN, RHODEY, THOR, STEVE, SMART HULK, and CLINT, all dressed in black, watching. TONY (CONT'D) What am I even tripping for? Everything is going to work out exactly the way it’s supposed to. HOLO TONY seems to look out at the gathered heroes...and Morgan in particular. TONY (CONT'D) I love you 3000. He switches off the camera, vanishing. Tears streaming, Pepper kisses Morgan’s forehead. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, BACK STAIRS - DAY PEPPER and MORGAN slowly descend the stairs, carrying an RT RINGED WITH FLOWERS. The Avengers follow, somber. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY PEPPER RESTS THE FLOWERS ON THE WATER. CLOSE ON THE RT: “Proof That Tony Stark Has A Heart.” Pull back, past Morgan and HAPPY HOGAN... PAST STEVE, SAM, RHODEY, AND WANDA... PAST CLINT, LAURA, LILA, COOPER, and NATHANIEL... PAST THOR AND SMART HULK... PAST SCOTT, HOPE, HANK PYM, and JANET VAN DYNE... PAST PETER PARKER and AUNT MAY... PAST T’CHALLA, OKOYE, and SHURI, TONY (O.S.) (CONT'D)  PAST STRANGE and WONG... PAST QUILL, NEBULA, GROOT, MANTIS, and ROCKET... PAST BUCKY BARNES... PAST SECRETARY ROSS and HARLEY KEENER... PAST MARIA HILL, CAROL DANVERS, and, finally, NICK FURY. THE MOURNERS MOVE TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, LAKESIDE - DAY LATER...CLINT looks out at the lake. WANDA approaches. CLINT BARTON I just wish there were some way I could let her know that we won. That we did it. WANDA She knows. They both do. Clint puts his arm around her. They stare out at the water. EXT. STARK ECO-COMPOUND, PORCH/BACK STAIRS- DAY ON THE PORCH, HAPPY HOGAN HOLDS MORGAN’S HAND. HAPPY HOGAN How are you doing, squirt? You hungry? MORGAN STARK Uh, huh. HAPPY HOGAN What do you want? MORGAN STARK Cheeseburgers? Happy takes a beat, choked up. Like father like daughter. HAPPY HOGAN Did you know your dad liked cheeseburgers? MORGAN STARK No, I didn’t know that.   HAPPY HOGAN I’m going to get you all the cheeseburgers you want. EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY THOR and VALKYRIE look down on NEW ASGARD. VALKYRIE So when can we expect you back? THOR About that... VALKYRIE Thor, your people need a king. THOR They already have one. And she’s a far better king than I could ever be. VALKYRIE Are you serious? THOR It’s time to be who I am, rather than who I’m supposed to be. And a leader is who you are. She processes this. Does she want it? She does. VALKYRIE You know, I’d make a lot of changes around here. THOR I’m counting on it, Your Majesty. Emotional, Val finally SHAKES HIS HAND. VALKYRIE What will you do? THOR I’m not entirely sure. For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. (beat) But I do have a ride. REVEAL...THE BENATAR parked behind them, Rocket alongside.   ROCKET Move it or lose it, Hairbag. INT. BENATAR - DAY THOR drops his duffle bag on the deck of the Benatar. QUILL, MANTIS, DRAX, NEBULA, and ROCKET ready the engines. THOR Home sweet home. Tree! Good to see you. The Asgardians of the Galaxy, together again. He settles beside Quill, who holomaps their course. THOR (CONT'D) All right, where first? He swipes through images on the screen. QUILL You know, I’m still in charge, here, right? THOR Of course. Of course... Thor swipes the map again. QUILL See, when you keep swiping my map, that sounds kind of like, “of course, I know you think you’re still in charge-” THOR Quail, that’s your own insecurities bubbling up. DRAX You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. NEBULA Sounds fair. QUILL That’s not necessary... ROCKET I’ve got some blasters right here. Unless you want to use knives.   MANTIS Oh, yes, please, use knivesQUILL No one’s using knives! GROOT I am Groot! Quill and Thor exchange nervous laughter. THOR There’ll be no knifing young Quail today. Everyone knows who’s in charge. A long awkward moment passes. QUILL Me. (sotto, to Thor) Right? Thor just smiles... EXT. NEW ASGARD, HILLSIDE - DAY The ship rises. WHOOSH. IT MAKES THE JUMP AND DISAPPEARS. EXT. AVENGERS COMPOUND, RUINS - DAY CONSTRUCTION CREWS REMOVE RUBBLE FROM AVENGERS COMPOUND. A COMMAND TENT stands in a clearing beside... A NEW QUANTUM TUNNEL (3.0). As STEVE, SAM, and BUCKY wait, SMART HULK makes last minute adjustments. He finally opens A CASE: THE SIX INFINITY STONES GLOW INSIDE. SMART HULK Remember, you’ll have to return the stones to the exact moment they were taken. Otherwise, we’re still looking at a whole bunch of nasty alternate realities. STEVE Got it. I’ll clip all the branches.   Steve takes the case. SMART HULK You know, I tried. When I had the gauntlet. I really tried to bring her back. (beat) I miss her. STEVE Me, too. SMART HULK You’d better get going. We’re almost ready for you. Steve and Sam approach the platform. SAM WILSON You look a little nervous going by yourself. Ask nicely, I’ll go with you. STEVE You’re a good man, Sam. But this one’s on me. When Steve reaches the platform, BUCKY stops him, pointed. STEVE (CONT'D) Don’t do anything stupid ‘til I get back, okay? BUCKY BARNES How can I? You’re taking all the stupid with you. Steve grins. Bucky gives him a long hug. BUCKY BARNES (CONT'D) Gonna miss you, buddy. STEVE It’s going to be okay, Buck. Steve picks up Mjolnir and takes his place on the platform. SAM LOOKS TO SMART HULK AT THE CONSOLE. SAM WILSON How long’s this gonna take?   SMART HULK For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. (calling out) Ready, Cap? You’re good to go. Meet you right back here, okay? Steve glances at Bucky as he answers. STEVE You bet. SMART HULK Going Quantum in three, two, one. STEVE TAPS HIS CUFF AND SHRINKS TO NOTHING. SMART HULK (CONT'D) Aaand, returning in five... four...three...two...oneSilence. Nothing happens. SAM WILSON Where is he? SMART HULK I don’t know. He blew past our time stamp. He should be here. SAM WILSON Get him back! SMART HULK I’m trying. SAM WILSON Get him the hell backSMART HULK I’M TRYING! Just then...Bucky looks out to the water. BUCKY BARNES Sam. Sam turns... EXT AVENGERS COMPOUND, RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS Work crews have cleared a space overlooking the river. There, AN OLD MAN sits on a bench, staring out at the Hudson.   Move around him to find SAM watching from A FEW YARDS AWAY. SAM WILSON Hey, Cap. The man turns and we now see: STEVE ROGERS, age 112. OLD STEVE Hi, Sam. SAM WILSON Something go wrong...or something go right? OLD STEVE I thought, after everything that’s happened...maybe I should try out some of that life Tony always told me to get. SAM WILSON How was it? Steve looks at the river, 112 years of emotion in his face. OLD STEVE It was beautiful. SAM WILSON I’m happy for you. Really. OLD STEVE Thanks. SAM WILSON Only thing bumming me out is now I live in a world without Captain America. Steve pulls up A CASE from beside him, giving it to Sam. OLD STEVE That’s kind of why I’m here. Sam unzips it, revealing...A BRAND NEW SHIELD. SAM WILSON Where did you even get this? OLD STEVE I had a little time to travel. (beat) Try it on.   Sam hesitates. He glances back at Bucky, who nods. Then Sam picks up the shield...and puts it on. OLD STEVE (CONT'D) How does it feel? SAM WILSON Like it’s someone else’s. OLD STEVE It isn’t. Sam tries to check his emotion. He shakes Steve’s hand. SAM WILSON Thank you. I’ll try my best. Steve rests his other hand on Sam’s. OLD STEVE That’s why it’s yours. Sam smiles, noticing...STEVE’S TARNISHED WEDDING RING. SAM WILSON You gonna tell me about her? Steve smiles to himself at the end of a long, long life. OLD STEVE Nope. I don’t think I will. CUE MUSIC: “IT’S BEEN A LONG, LONG TIME,” HARRY JAMES. EXT. COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A PACKARD rolls down a block of WASHINGTON D.C. ROW HOUSES. TITLE: “WASHINGTON D.C., 1949.” Find a red house in the middle of the block. Move up the steps to the front door...WHICH HANGS WIDE OPEN. INT. RED HOUSE, COLUMBIA HEIGHTS, WASHINGTON DC - DAY A TEA CUP LIES SHATTERED on the hardwood. We hear Harry James. Move into the living room...past the record player... TO WHERE STEVE DANCES WITH A WOMAN. They rock back and forth barely moving. As they turn, we see...   PEGGY CARTER, tears streaming down her face. He steps on her toe. She laughs. As they turn, we get a good look at... Steve Rogers, eyes shut, finally getting the life he deserves. THE END.

Avengers: Infinity War
By Christopher Markus

This is the Asgardian
refugee vessel.
We are under assault. I
repeat, we are under assault.
Aliens are dead, sliced open...
Requesting aid from any
vessel within range...
Our crew is made of Asgardian
families, we have very few soldiers here.
This is not a war craft, I
repeat, this is not a war craft.
Hear me... and rejoice.
You have had the privilege
of being saved
by the Great Titan.
You may think this is suffering.
No.
It is salvation.
Universal scales
tipped toward balance
because of your sacrifice.
Smile
for even in death
you have become
Children of Thanos.
I know what it's like to lose.
To feel so desperately
that you're right,
yet to fail nonetheless.
As lightning
turns the legs to jelly.
I ask you
to what end?
Dread it, run from it...
Destiny arrives all the same.
And now, it's here.
Or should I say...
I am.
You talk too much.
The Tesseract.
Or, your brother's head.
I assume you have a preference?
Oh, I do.
Kill away.

All right, stop!
We don't have the Tesseract.
It was destroyed on Asgard.
You really are the worst, brother.
I assure you, brother. The
sun will shine on us again.
Your optimism is
misplaced, Asgardian.
Well, for one thing,
I'm not Asgardian.
And for another...
we have a Hulk.
Let him have his fun.
Forefathers...
Let the dark magic, flow
through me one last... time.
That was a mistake.
No!
You are going to die for that!
My humble personage...
bows before your grandeur.
No other being, has
ever had the might,
nay, the nobility,
to wield not one,
but two Infinity Stones.
The Universe,
lies within your grasp.
There are two more
Stones on Earth.
Find them, my Children, and
bring them to me on Titan.
- Father, we will not fail you.
- If I might, interject...
If you're going to Earth,
you might want a guide.
I do have a bit of
experience in that arena.
If you consider failure experience.
I consider experience, experience.
Almighty Thanos.
I, Loki, Prince of Asgard...
Odin-son...
The rightful king of Jotunheim,

God of Mischief...
Do hereby pledge to you,
my undying fidelity.
"Undying"?
You should choose your
words more carefully.
You...
will never be...
a god.
No resurrections this time.
No... Loki...
Seriously? You don't
have any money?
Attachment to the material is
detachment from the spiritual.
I'll tell the guys at the deli.
Maybe they'll make you a
metaphysical Ham and Rye.
- Wait, wait. I think I got a 200.
- Dollars?
- Rupees.
- Which is?
I wouldn't say no
to a Tuna Melt.
Thanos is coming.
We've got to...
Who?
Slow down. I'm
totally not kidding.
- No, I'm not.
- Your rambling lost me.
Look, you know how you're having a
dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
Yeah.
Okay, then you're like, my
God, there's no bathroom,
what am I gonna do? Oh!
Someone's watching!
Right. And then you wake up, and in
real life you actually have to pee.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Everybody has that.
Right. That's the point

I'm trying to make.
Last night, I dreamt,
we had a kid.
So real.
We named him after
your eccentric uncle.
- What was his name? Porsey. Morgan.
- Right.
So you woke up,
and we were...
- Expecting.
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- No.
- I had a dream about it. It was so real.
- If you wanted to have a kid...
You wouldn't have done that.
I'm glad you brought this up
cause it's nothing,
just a housing unit for nano-parts.
- It's not helping your case. OK?
- It's an attachment. It's not a...
- You don't need that.
- I know. I had the surgery.
I'm just trying to protect us.
The future, as is, and that's it.
Just in case there's a monster in
the closet. Just letting you know.
Shirts.
You know me so well.
You finish all my sentences.
You should have shirts
in your closet.
Yeah. You know what
there should be?
No more surprises. We'll
have a nice dinner tonight.
We should have no more surprises.
Ever. I should promise you.
- Yeah.
- I will.
Tony Stark,
I'm Dr. Stephen Strange.
I need you to come with me.

Oh. Congratulations on
the wedding, by the way.
I'm sorry. You giving
out tickets or something?
We need your help.
Look, it's not overselling it to say that
the fate of the Universe is at stake.
And who's "we"?
- Hey, Tony.
- Bruce!
You okay?
From the dawn of the Universe,
there was nothing.
Then, boom!
The Big Bang sends
six elemental crystals,
hurdling across the virgin Universe.
These Infinity Stones
each control an essential
aspect of existence.
Space.
Reality.
Power.
Soul.
Mind.
And Time.
- Tell me his name again.
- Thanos.
He's a plague, Tony. He invades planets.
He takes what he wants.
He wipes out half the population.
He sent Loki.
The attack on New York. That's him.
- What's our time line?
- No telling.
He has the Power and Space Stones,
that only makes him the strongest
creature in the whole Universe.
If he gets his hands, on
all six Stones, Tony...
He can destroy life on a scale
of hitherto hundredth of.
Did you seriously just say
"hitherto hundredth of"?

Are you seriously leaning on
the Cauldron of the Cosmos?
Is that what that is?
I'm going to allow that.
If Thanos needs all six,
why don't we just stick this
one down the garbage disposal?
No can do.
We swore an oath to protect
the Time Stone with our lives.
And I swore off dairy, but Ben &
Jerry's named a flavor after me, so...
- Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
- It's not bad.
A bit chalky.
"A Hunka-Hulka Burning
Fudge" is our favorite.
- That's a thing?
- Whatever. Point is, things change.
Our oath to protect the
Time Stone cannot change.
This Stone may be the best
chance we have against Thanos.
And still conversely, it may also be
his best chance against us!
Only if we don't do our jobs.
What is your job exactly,
besides making balloon animals?
Protecting your
reality, douche bag.
Okay guys, can we quick cable
this discussion right now?
The fact is we have the stone.
We know where it is.
Vision is out there somewhere
with the Mind Stone.
And we have to find him now.
- Yeah, that's the thing.
- What do you mean?
Two weeks ago, Vision turned off
his transponder. He's offline.
What?
- Tony, you lost another super bot?
- I didn't lose him. He's more than that.

- He's evolving.
- Who could find Vision, then?
- Probably Steve Rogers.
- Oh, great.
Maybe. But...
Call him.
It's not that easy.
God, we haven't caught up in a spell,
have we?
The Avengers broke up.
We're toast.
Broke up?
- Like a band? Like The Beatles?
- Cap and I fell out hard.
We're not on speaking terms.
Tony, listen to me.
Thor's gone.
Thanos is coming. It doesn't matter
who you're talking to or not.
Say, Doc, you wouldn't happen to
be moving your hair, would you?
Not at the moment, no.
You okay?
- Help him. Wong, Doc.
- Got it.
- Friday, what am I looking at?
- Not sure. I'm working on it.
You better not put that Time
Stone in your back pocket, Doc!
I might wanna use it.
Ned, hey. I need you
to cause a distraction.
Holy shit!
We're all gonna die!
There's a spaceship!
What's the matter with you kids?
You never seen a spaceship before?
Friday, evac anyone south of 43rd
Street, notify first responders.
Will do.
Hear me, and rejoice!
You are about to die at the hands
of the Children of Thanos.
Be thankful, that your meaningless

lives are now contributing to...
I'm sorry, Earth is closed today.
You better pack it up
and get outta here.
Stone keeper...
Does this chattering
animal speak for you?
Certainly not. I speak for myself.
There's no trespassing in
this city and on this planet.
- You need to get lost, Squidward!
- They exhaust me.
Bring me the Stone.
Hey, do you want a piece?
No, not really. But when
do I ever get what I want.
Been a while. Good
to have you, buddy.
I just... I need to
concentrate for a second.
Come on, come on, Max.
Where's your guy?
I don't know. We're
certainly having a thing.
There's no time for a thing. That's
the thing right there. Let's go.
Dude, you're embarrassing me
in front of the wizards.
- I can't... He won't...
- It's okay. Stand down.
- Can I leave you with him? Thank you.
- I have him.
- Where'd that come from?
- It's nano-tech. You like it? A little...
Dr. Banner, if the rest of your
green friend won't be joining us...
- You gotta get that stone outta here, now.
- It stays with me.
Exactly. Bye!
Tony, you okay? How we doing?
Good, bad?
Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
I'm trying. He won't come out.
Come on, Hulk. What

are you doing?
Come on. Come on! Come on!
No!
What do you mean, "no"?
- Hey, man! What's up, Mr. Stark?
- Kid, where'd you come from?
The field trip.
What is this guy's problem, Mr.
Stark?
He's from space, came here to
steal a necklace from a wizard.
Your powers are quaint. You
must be popular with children.
It's a simple spell
but quite unbreakable.
Then I'll take it
off your corpse.
You wouldn't. Removing a dead
man's spell... Troublesome.
You'll only wish you were dead.
No!
- Kid, that's the wizard. Get on it.
- On it!
Not cool.
- Mr. Stark? I'm being beamed up.
- Hang on, kid.
Wong, you're invited
to my wedding.
Give me a little juice, Friday.
Unlock 17-A.
Kid, you gotta let go.
I'm gonna catch you.
But you said save the wizard!
I can't breathe!
You're too high up. You're
running out of air.
That makes sense.
Mr. Stark, it smells
like a new car in here.
- Happy trails, kid. Friday, send him home.
- Yup.
Oh, come on!
Boss, incoming call
from Miss Potts.

Tony? Oh, my God. Are you all right?
What's going on?
Yeah, I'm fine. I just think we
might have to push our 8:30 res.
Why?
Just 'cause I'll probably
not make it back for awhile.
- Tell me you're not on that ship.
- Yeah.
God, no. Please tell me
you're not on that ship.
Honey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I don't know how to say this. Pep...
Come back here, Tony. I swear to God...
Come back here right now!
Come back!
Boss, we're losing her.
I'm going, too...
Oh, my God.
I should have stayed on the bus.
- Where you going?
- Time Stone's been taken.
The Sanctum remains unguarded.
What will you do?
I'm gonna make a call.
Sing it, Drax!
Why are we doing this again?
It's a distress signal, Rocket.
Someone could be dying.
- I get that, but why are we doing it?
- 'Cause we're nice.
And maybe whoever it is will give us a
little cheddar cheese for our help...
- Which isn't the point.
- Which isn't the point... I mean...
- If he doesn't pony up...
- We'll take his ship.
- Exactly! Alright!
- B-b-b-bingo!
We are arriving.
All right, Guardians.
Don't forget, this might
be dangerous, so let's
put on our mean faces.

Groot, put that thing away. Now.
I don't wanna tell you again. Groot.
I am Groot!
- Whoa! Language!
- Wow!
You got some acorns on you, kid.
Ever since you got little
sap, you're a total d-hole.
Keep it up, and I'm gonna
smash that thing to pieces!
What happened?
Oh, my God.
Looks like we're
not getting paid.
Wipers! Wipers! Get it off.
How the hell is this
dude still alive?
He is not a dude. You're a dude.
This... This is a man.
- Handsome, muscular man.
- I'm muscular.
Who are you kidding, Quill? You're
one sandwich away from fat.
- Yeah, right. What?
- It's true. You have little weight...
Gamora, do you think I'm...
He is anxious. Angry.
He feels tremendous
loss and guilt.
It's like a pirate had
a baby with an angel.
Wow. This is a real wake-up
call for me. Okay.
I'm gonna get a Bowflex.
I'm gonna commit.
I'm gonna get some dumbbells.
You know you can't eat
dumbbells, right?
It's like his muscles are
made of Cotati metal fiber.
Stop massaging his muscles.
Wake him up.
Wake.
Who the hell are you guys?

The entire time I knew Thanos,
he only ever had one goal:
To bring balance to the Universe
by wiping out half of all life.
He used to kill people planet by
planet, massacre by massacre.
- Including my own.
- If he gets all six Infinity Stones,
he can do it with the snap
of his fingers, like this.
You seem to know a
great deal about Thanos.
Gamora... is the
daughter of Thanos.
- Your father killed my brother.
- Oh, boy.
Stepfather. Technically, she
hates him as much as you do.
Thanos can be tough.
Look. Before my father died,
he told me I had a half-sister...
that he imprisoned in Hell.
Then she returned
home, and stabbed me in the eye,
so... I had to kill her.
It's life, there was nothing else.
- And I feel your pain.
- I feel your pain, as well.
I mean it's not a competition,
but I've been through a lot.
My father killed my mother, then I had
to kill my father. And that was hard.
Probably even harder than
having to kill a sister.
Plus, I, came out
with both of my eyes.
I need a hammer, not a spoon...
How do I open this thing?
Is there some sort of a
four-digit code maybe...
- Maybe a birth date or something...
- What are you doing?
Taking your pod.
No, you're not!

You'll not, be taking
our pod today, sir.
Quill. Are you making your voice deeper?
- No.
- You are.
You're imitating the god-man.
It's weird.
- No I'm not.
- He just did it again!
This is my voice!
- Are you mocking me?
- Are you mocking me?
You just did it again.
He's trying to copy me.
Enough! We need to stop Thanos.
Which means we need to find
out where he's going next.
Nowhere.
- He must be going somewhere.
- No. Nowhere? It's a place.
We've been there. It sucks.
Excuse me, that's our food.
- Not anymore.
- Thor...
Why would he go to nowhere?
Because for years,
reality stone has been safely stored,
there with a man
we call the collector.
If it's with the Collector,
then it's not safe.
Only an idiot would
give that man a stone.
Or a genius.
How do you know he's not going
for one of the other stones?
There's six stones out there.
Thanos already has the Power Stone
because he stole it last week,
when he decimated Xandar.
He stole the Space Stone from me.
When he destroyed my ship and
slaughtered half my people.
The Time and Mind Stones are safe on Earth.

They're with the Avengers.
- The Avengers?
- They're Earth's Mightiest Heroes.
- Like Kevin Bacon?
- He may be on the team. I don't know.
Haven't been there in a while.
As for the Soul Stone,
no one's ever seen that.
No one even knows where it is.
Therefore, Thanos can't get it.
Therefore, he's going to Nowhere.
Hence, he'll be getting the Reality Stone.
You're welcome.
- Then we have to go to Nowhere now.
- Wrong.
- Where we have to go, is Nivadellir.
- That's a made up word.
- Oh what's made up?
- Nidavellir is real? Seriously?
I mean, that place is a legend. They
make the most powerful,
horrific weapons to ever
torment the Universe.
I would very much like
to go there, please.
The rabbit is correct, and
clearly the smartest one.
Rabbit?
Only Eitri the dwarf king can
make me the weapon I need.
- I assume you're the captain, sir?
- You're very perceptive.
You seem like a noble leader. Will you
join me on my quest to Nivadellir?
Lemme just ask the captain. Wait a
second, it's me! Yeah, I'll go.
- Wonderful.
- Except that I'm the captain.
- Quiet!
- And that's my backpack.
- Quill, sit down.
- Look, this is my ship.
And I'm not going to...
Wait, what kind of weapon

are we talking about here?
The Thanos killing kind.
Don't you think that we should
all have a weapon like that?
No. You simply lack the
strength to wield them.
Your bodies will crumble as you
minds collapse to the madness.
Is it weird that I wanna
do it even more now?
A little bit. Yeah.
If we don't go to Nowhere and
Thanos retrieves another stone,
- he'll be too powerful to stop.
- He already is.
I got it figured out.
We got two ships, and the
largest go with the morons.
So me and Groot will go
with the pirate-angel here,
and the morons will go to
Nowhere to try and stop Thanos.
- Cool? Cool.
- So cool.
For the record...
I know that you're only going with
him because it's where Thanos isn't.
You know, you shouldn't talk
that way to your captain, Quill.
Come on, Groot.
Put that game down.
You'll rot your brain.
I bid you farewell and
good luck, morons. Bye.
Vis?
Is it the stone again?
It's as if it's speaking to me.
What does it say?
I don't... I don't know.
Something...
Tell me what you feel.
I just feel you.
So there's a 10 AM to Glasgow
to give us more time together

before you went back.
- What if I miss that train?
- There is an 11.
What if I missed all the trains?
What if this time,
I didn't go back?
- You gave Stark your word.
- I'd rather give it to you.
There are people who are expecting me
too, you know. We both made promises.
Not to each other.
Wanda...
Two years, we've stolen these moments,
trying to see if this could work.
And... I don't know. You know what,
I'm just gonna speak for myself.
- I, I... I think... It works.
- It works. It works.
Stay.
Or not. If I'm overstepping...
What are they?
What the stone was
warning me about.
- I have to go.
- No. Vision. If that's true...
Then maybe going isn't
the best idea.
Wanda, I...
The blade. It stopped
me from phasing.
- Is that even possible?
- It isn't supposed to be.
Vis!
Give up the Stone,
and she lives.
Hands off.
Come on. You gotta get up.
You gotta get up. Come on.
We have to go.
- Please leave.
- You asked me to stay.
I'm staying.
- Get up.
- I can't.

We don't wanna kill you.
But we will.
You'll never get
the chance again.
Can you stand?
Thank you, Captain.
Let's get you on the jet.
I thought
we had a deal.
Stay close, check in.
Don't take any chances.
I'm sorry. We just wanted time.
Where to, Cap?
Home.
We'll be safe.
- Zen-Whoberians...
- Mother!
- Choose a side, or die.
- Mother!
One side, for reservation.
The other, an honor...
What's wrong, little one?
My mother. Where is my mother?
What's your name?
Gamora.
You're quite the
fighter, Gamora.
Come. Let me help you.
Look.
Pretty, isn't it?
Perfectly balanced.
As all things should be.
Too much to one side,
or the other...
Here. You try.
Now go in peace, and
meet your maker.
Concentrate.
There! You've got it.
Gamora.
You know these grenades are the
"blow off your junk" kind or the gas kind?
'Cause I was thinking I might hang
a couple on my belt right here.

- But I don't want to...
- I need to ask a favor.
Yeah, sure.
One way or another, the path
that we're on leads to Thanos.
Which is what the
grenades are for.
I'm sorry. What's the favor?
If things go wrong...
If Thanos gets me...
I want you to promise me...
you'll kill me.
What?
I know something he doesn't.
If he finds it out...
- The entire Universe could be at risk.
- What do you know?
If I tell you, you'd know, too.
If it's so important,
shouldn't I?
Only if you wanna die.
Why does somebody always
have to die in this scenario?
Just...
trust me. And
possibly, kill me.
I mean, I'd like to.
I really would...
Swear to me.
Swear to me on your mother.
Okay.
Dude! How long have you
been standing there?
- An hour.
- An hour?
Are you serious?
I've mastered the ability, of
standing so incredibly still...
That I've become invisible
to the eye. Watch.
- You're eating a zark nut.
- But my movement...
So slow...
- And it's imperceptible.

- No.
- I'm sure I'm invisible.
- Hi, Drax.
Damn it.
- This place looks deserted.
- I'm reading movement.
- From the third quadrant.
- Yeah. I'm picking that up, too.
Let's put it down over here.
I know you have the Reality Stone.
Giving it to me will spare you
a great deal of suffering.
I told you. I sold it.
- Why would I lie?
- I imagine it's like breathing for you.
- Like suicide.
- So you do understand.
Not even you will surrender
something so precious.
I didn't know what it was.
Then you're more of a
fool than I took you for.
Last chance, Charlotte.
Where's the Stone?
Today, he pays for the deaths
of my wife and daughter.
Drax, wait!
Whoa, not yet!
He doesn't have the Stone yet.
We get it, and then
we can stop him.
We have to get the Stone first.
Yeah.
No. No. For Ovette.
For Camaria.
Sleep.
Okay. Gamora, Mantis,
you go right.
I'm... The other right!
Why?
Why you? Daughter...
That was quick.
Magnificent! Magnificent!
Is it sadness I sense

in you, daughter?
In my heart, I knew
you still cared.
No one ever knows for sure.
Reality is often disappointing.
That is, it was.
Now...
Reality can be whatever I want.
- You knew I'd come.
- I counted on it.
There's something we need
to discuss, little one.
Thanos!
- Let her go, Grimace!
- Peter...
- I told you to go right.
- Now...
- You let her go!
- Ah, the boyfriend.
I like to think of myself more as a
Titan-killing long term booty call.
- Let her go.
- Peter...
Or I'm gonna blow that nut-sack
of a chin right off your face!
Not him.
You promised!
Oh, daughter. You expect
too much from him.
She's asked, hasn't she?
Do it.
Do it!
I told you to go right!
I love you, more than anything.
I love you, too.
I like you.
Still no word from Vision?
Satellites lost him
somewhere over Edinburgh.
On a stolen quinjet with four of
the world's most wanted criminals.
You know they're only criminals
because you've chosen to call them that,
right, sir?

My God, Rhodes, your talent
for horseshit rivals my own.
If it weren't for those Accords,
Vision would've been right here.
I remember your signature
on those papers, Colonel.
That's right.
And I'm pretty sure
I've paid for that.
- Do you have second thoughts?
- Not anymore.
Mr. Secretary.
You got some nerve.
I'll give you that.
You could use some
of that right now.
The world's on fire.
And you think, all is forgiven?
I'm not looking for forgiveness. And
I'm way past asking for permission.
Earth just lost her best defender.
So we're here to fight.
And if you wanna
stand in our way...
We'll fight you, too.
- Arrest them.
- All over it.
That's a court-martial.
- It's great to see you, Cap.
- You too, Rhodey.
Hey.
Well. You guys, really
look like crap.
Must've been a rough
couple of years.
Yeah, well, the hotels
weren't exactly five star.
I think you look great.
Yeah. I'm back.
Hi, Bruce.
Nat.
This is awkward.
We gotta assume they're
coming back, right?

And they can clearly find us.
We need all hands on deck.
Where's Clint?
After the whole Accords
situation, he and Scott
took a deal. It's too
tough on their families.
- Who's Scott?
- Ant-Man.
There's an Ant-Man
and a Spider-Man?
Okay, look...
Thanos has the biggest
army in the Universe.
And he is not gonna
stop until he... He gets...
Vision's stone.
- Well then, we have to protect it.
- No, we have to destroy it.
I've been giving a good deal of thought to
this entity in my head about its nature.
But also, its composition.
I think if it were exposed
to a sufficiently
powerful energy
source, something,
very similar to its own
signature, perhaps...
Its molecular
integrity could fail.
And you, with it.
We're not having
this conversation.
Eliminating the stone is the
only way to be certain that
- Thanos can't get it.
- That's too high a price.
Only you, have the
power to pay it.
Thanos threatens
half the Universe.
One life cannot stand in
the way of defeating him.
But it should.

We don't trade lives, Vision.
Captain, 70 years ago, you laid down
your life to save millions of people.
Tell me, why is
this any different?
Because you might have a choice.
Your mind is made up of a
complex construct of overlays.
Jarvis, Ultron, Tony,
me, the stone.
All of them mixed together. All of
them learning from one another.
- You're saying Vision isn't just a stone?
- I'm saying that...
If we take out the stone, there's
still a whole lot of Vision left.
- Perhaps the best parts.
- Can we do that?
Not me. Not here.
Well you better find someone
and somewhere fast.
Ross isn't just gonna let you
guys have your old rooms back.
I know somewhere.
The Kingsguard and the Dora
Milaje have been alerted.
And the Border Tribe?
- Those that are left.
- Send word to the Jabari as well.
M'Baku likes a good fight.
And what of this one?
This one may be tired of war.
But the White Wolf has
rested long enough.
Where's the fight?
On its way.
In all the time I
have served Thanos...
I have never failed him.
If I were to reach our
rendezvous on Titan,
with the Time Stone still attached
to your vaguely irritating person...
There would be judgment.

Give me...
the Stone.
Wow. You are a seriously
loyal piece of hardware.
Speaking of loyalty...
- I know what you're gonna say to me.
- You should not be here.
- I was gonna go home.
- I don't wanna hear it!
But it was such a long way
down and I just thought about...
And now I gotta hear it.
And this suit is, ridiculously
intuitive, by the way.
So, if anything, its kind of
your fault that I'm here.
- What did you just say?
- I take that back.
And now I'm here in space.
Yeah. Right where I
didn't want you to be.
This isn't Coney Island,
or some field trip.
This is a one-way ticket.
Do you hear me?
- Don't pretend you thought this through.
- I did think this through.
You can't be a friendly neighborhood
Spider-Man if there's no neighborhood.
Okay, that didn't make sense but
you know what I'm trying to say.
Come on. We got a situation.
See him down there? He's in trouble.
What's your plan? Go.
Okay, okay.
OK, you ever see this
really old movie Aliens?
Painful, aren't they?
They were originally
designed for microsurgery.
And any one of them...
I could end your friend's
life in an instant.
I gotta tell you, he's

not really my friend.
Saving his life is more of
a professional courtesy.
You've saved nothing.
Your powers are inconsequential
compared to mine.
Yeah, but the kid's
seen more movies.
Yes!
Wait, what are those?
Hey, we haven't officially met.
Cool.
- We gotta turn this ship around.
- Yeah. Now he wants to run.
Great, I want to protect the stone.
And I want you to thank me now.
Go ahead, I'm listening.
For what? Nearly
blasting me to space?
Who just saved your magical ass?
Me.
I seriously don't know how you
fit your head into that helmet.
Admit it. You should've ducked
out when I told you to.
I tried to bench
you, you refused.
Unlike everyone else in your
life, I don't work for you.
And due to that fact,
we're now in a flying doughnut,
billions of miles from Earth,
- with no back-up.
- I'm back-up!
No. You're a stowaway.
The adults are talking.
I'm confused as to the relationship
here, I mean, what is he? Your ward?
- No. I'm Peter, by the way.
- Doctor Strange.
Oh, we're using our
made-up names.
I'm Spider-Man, then.
The ship is self-correcting its course.

Thing's on autopilot.
Can we control it? Fly us home?
- Stark.
- Yeah?
- Can you get us home?
- Yeah. Heard you.
I'm not so sure we should.
Under no circumstances can we
bring the Time Stone to Thanos.
I don't think you quite
understand what's at stake here.
No. It's you who doesn't
understand that
Thanos has been inside
my head for six years
since he sent an army to New
York, and now he's back!
And I don't know what to do.
So I'm not so sure if it's a better
plan to fight him on our turf or his.
But you saw. What they
did, what they can do.
At least, let's hope
he's not expecting it.
So I say we take the
fight to him, Doctor.
Do you concur?
All right, Stark. We go to him.
But you have to understand...
If it comes to saving you, the
kid, or the Time Stone...
I will not hesitate to
let either of you die.
I can't. Because the
universe depends on it.
Nice. Good. Moral compass.
All right, kid...
You're an Avenger now.
I thought you might be hungry.
I always hated that chair.
So I've been told.
Even so, I hoped you'd
sit in it one day.
I hated this room, this ship...

I hated my life.
You told me that, too.
Everyday.
For almost twenty years.
I was a child when you took me.
I saved you.
No. We were happy
on my home planet.
Going to bed hungry?
Scrounging for scraps?
Your planet was on the brink of collapse.
I'm the one who stopped that.
You know what's happened since then?
The children born, have
known nothing but full
bellies and clear skies.
It's a paradise.
Because you murdered
half the planet.
A small price to
pay for salvation.
- You're insane.
- Little one, it's a simple calculus.
This universe is finite.
Its resources, finite.
If life is left unchecked,
life will cease to exist.
- It needs correction.
- You don't know that!
I'm the only one who knows that.
At least, I'm the only one
with the will to act on it.
For a time...
You...
had that same will,
as you fought by my side,
daughter.
I'm not your daughter.
Everything I hated about
myself, you taught me.
And in doing so, made you the
fiercest woman in the galaxy.
It's why I trusted you
to find the Soul Stone.

I'm sorry I disappointed you.
I am disappointed.
But not because
you didn't find it.
But because you did.
And you lied.
Nebula!
Don't do this.
Sometime ago, your sister snuck
aboard this ship to kill me.
- Please, don't do this.
- She very nearly succeeded.
So, I brought her here...
to talk.
Stop. Stop it.
I swear to you, on my life...
I never found the Soul Stone.
Accessing memory files.
You know what he's about to do.
He's finally ready, and he's going
for the stones. All of them.
He'll never get them all.
He can't, Nebula.
Because I found the map to the Soul
Stone, and I burned it to ash.
I burned it.
You're strong.
Me...
The generous... me...
But I never taught you to lie.
That's why you're so bad at it.
Where is the Soul Stone?
Vormir.
The stone is on Vormir.
Show me.
I am Groot.
Tinkle in the cup.
We're not looking for...
What's a twig?
Everybody's seen a twig.
I am Groot!
You can pour what's
in the cup out in space
then go in the cup again.

You speak Groot?
Yes, the tone on Asgard,
that was an elective.
- I am Groot.
- You'll know when we're close.
Nivadellir's forge harnesses the
blazing power of the Neutron star.
It's the birthplace of my hammer.
It's truly awesome.
Okay. Time to be the captain.
So dead brother, huh? Yeah,
that could be annoying.
Well, he's been dead before.
Now this time, I think
it really might be true.
- And you said your sister and your dad...
- Both dead.
- But still got a mom, though?
- Killed by a Dark Elf.
- A best friend?
- Stabbed through the heart.
You sure you're up to
this particular mission?
Absolutely!
The rage and vengeance, anger...
Loss, regret, they're all
tremendous motivators.
They really clear the
mind, so I'm good to go.
Yeah, but this Thanos
we're talking about,
he's the toughest there is.
- Well, he's never fought me.
- Yeah, he has.
He's never fought me twice.
I'm getting a new
hammer, don't forget.
It better be some hammer.
You know, I'm 1,500 years old.
I've killed twice as many
enemies as that, and
every one of them
would've rather killed me
but none succeeded.

I'm only alive because
fate wants me alive.
Thanos is just the, latest
in a long line of bastards
and he will be the latest to feel
my vengeance. Fate wills it so.
And what if you're wrong?
Well, if I'm wrong, then...
What more could I lose?
I could lose a lot. Me
personally, I could lose a lot.
Okay.
Well, if fate does want you
to kill that crapsack,
- you need more than one stupid eyeball.
- What's this?
What's it look like?
Some jerk lost a bet
with me in Contraxia.
- He gave you his eye?
- No, he gave me 100 credits.
I snuck into his room later
that night and stole his eye.
Thank you, sweet rabbit.
I would've washed that.
The only way I could sneak it
off Contraxia was on my...
Hey, we're here.
I don't think this thing works.
Everything seems dark.
But it ain't the eye.
Something's wrong.
The star's gone out.
And the rings are frozen.
I hope these dwarfs are better at
forging than they are at cleaning.
Maybe they realized they live in a
junk pile in the middle of space.
The forge hasn't gone
dark in centuries.
- You said Thanos had a gauntlet, right?
- Yes. Why?
Did it look anything like that?
- I am Groot.

- Get back to the pod.
Eitri, wait! Stop!
Thor?
- What happened here?
- You were supposed to protect us.
- Asgard was supposed to protect us.
- Asgard is destroyed.
Eitri, what did you do?
300 dwarfs lived on this ring.
I thought if I did what
he asked, they'd be safe.
I made what he wanted.
A device capable of harnessing
the power of the stones.
And he killed everyone anyway.
All except me.
"Your life is yours," he said.
"But your hands. Your
hands are mine alone."
Eitri, this isn't
about your hands.
Every weapon you've
ever designed,
every axe, hammer, sword,
it's all inside your head.
Now I know it feels like all hope is lost.
Trust me, I know.
But together, you and
I, we can kill Thanos.
Mantis, listen very carefully.
I need you to meet me on Titan.
- What's going on?
- I think we're here.
I don't think this rig has
a self-park function.
Get your hand inside this.
Then, we got one big dodge, so we
gotta move at the same time.
We might wanna turn, turn, turn.
Turn!
You all right?
That was close.
I owe you one.
Let me just say, if aliens wind up

implanting eggs in my chest or something,
- and I eat one of you, I'm sorry.
- I don't want another single,
pop-culture reference outta you for
the rest of the trip. Understand?
I'm trying to say that,
something is coming.
Thanos!
Oh, my God! Please don't
put your eggs in me!
Die, Blanket of Death!
Everybody stay where you
are, chill the F out...
I'm gonna ask you
this one time...
Where is Gamora?
Yeah, I'll do you one better.
Who's Gamora?
I'll do you one better!
Why is Gamora?
Let him go, or I swear to you, I'm
gonna french fry this little freak.
Let's do it. You shoot my guy and
I'll blast him. Let's go!
- Do it, Quill. I can take it.
- No, he can't take it.
She's right. You can't.
Oh yeah? You don't wanna
tell me where she is?
That's fine. I'll kill all three of you
and I'll beat it out of Thanos myself!
- Starting with you.
- Wait what, Thanos? All right...
Let me ask you this one time...
What master do you serve?
What master do I serve? Am
I supposed to say Jesus?
- You're from Earth.
- Not from Earth. I'm from Missouri.
Yeah, that's on Earth, dipshit.
What are you hassling us for?
- So you're not with Thanos?
- With Thanos?
No! I'm here to kill Thanos.

He took my girl. Wait, who are you?
We're the Avengers, man.
- You're the ones Thor told us about!
- You know Thor?
Yeah. Tall guy, not
that good-looking.
Where is he now?
This the plan? We'll
hit him with a brick?
It's a mold.
A king's weapon. Meant to
be the greatest in Asgard.
In theory, it could
even summon the Bifrost.
Does it have a name?
Storm breaker.
Yeah. It's a bit much.
So how do we make it?
You'll have to restart the forge.
Awaken the heart of the dying star.
Rabbit, fire up the pod.
What the hell happened
to this planet?
It's 8 degrees off its axis.
Gravitational pull is
all over the place.
Yeah, we got one advantage.
He's coming to us.
We'll use it. Alright,
I have a plan.
It's pretty simple. We draw him in,
pin him down, get what we need.
We definitely don't want to dance with
this guy, we just want the gauntlet.
Are you yawning?
In the middle of this,
while I'm breaking it down?
Did you hear what I said?
I stopped listening after you
said that we need a plan.
Okay, Mr. Clean's
on his own page.
See, not winging it isn't
really what they do.

What exactly is it that they do?
Kick names, take ass.
All right, just get over here, please?
Mr. Lord,
can you get your folks to circle up?
Star-Lord is fine.
We've gotta coalesce.
Because if all we come at him
with is a plucky attitude...
Dude, don't call us plucky.
We don't know what it means.
All right, we're optimistic, yes.
I like your plan, except it sucks.
So let me do the plan, and that
way, it might be really good.
Tell him about the dance-off
to save the Universe.
What dance-off?
- It's not a, it's not a...
- Like in Footloose? The movie?
Exactly like Footloose! Is it still
the greatest movie in history?
It never was.
- We're getting no help with Flash Gordon.
- Flash Gordon?
By the way? That's a compliment.
Don't forget.
I'm half-human. So that's
50% of me that's stupid,
- And that's 100% you.
- Your math is blowing my mind.
Excuse me?
But does your friend
often do that?
Strange! You all right?
- You're back. You're all right.
- Hey, what was that?
I went forward in time, to
view alternate futures...
To see all the possible
outcomes of the coming conflict.
- How many did you see?
- 14,000,605.
How many did we win?

One.
The Stone had
better be up there.
For your sister's sake.
Welcome, Thanos, son of Eros.
Gamora, daughter of Thanos.
You know us?
It is my curse to know
all who journey here.
Where is the Soul Stone?
You should know,
it extracts a terrible price.
I'm prepared.
We all think that at first.
We are all wrong.
How is it you know
this place so well?
A lifetime ago, I, too,
sought the stones.
I even held one in my hand.
But it cast me out.
Banished me here.
Guiding others to a
treasure I cannot possess.
What you seek lies
in front of you.
As does what you fear.
- What's this?
- The price.
Soul holds a special place
among the Infinity Stones.
You might say it is,
a certain wisdom.
Tell me what it needs.
To ensure
whoever possesses it,
understands its power...
The Stone demands a sacrifice.
Of what?
In order to take the Stone...
You must lose that
which you love.
A soul, for a soul.
All my life, I

dreamed of a day...
a moment...
when you got
what you deserved.
And I was always
so disappointed.
But, now...
You kill, and torture,
and you call it mercy.
The Universe has judged you.
You asked it for a prize and
and it told you, no.
You failed.
And do you wanna know why?
Because you love nothing.
No one.
Really? Tears?
They are not for him.
No.
This isn't love.
I ignored my destiny once.
I cannot do that again.
Even...
for you.
I'm sorry, little one.
Drop to 2,600. Heading 030.
I hope you're right about this,
or we're gonna land a lot
faster than you want to.
When you sad we were going
to open Wakanda to the
rest of the world, this
is not what I imagined.
What did you imagine?
The Olympics. Even a Starbucks.
- Should we bow?
- Yeah, he's a king.
Seems like I'm always
thanking you for something.
- What are you doing?
- We don't do that here.
So how big of an assault
should we expect?
Sir, I think you should expect

quite a big assault.
- How are we looking?
- You will have my Kingsguard.
The Border Tribe, the Dora Milaje.
And...
A semi-stable 100-year old man.
How have you been, Buck?
Not bad, for the
end of the world.
The structure is polymorphic.
Right. We had to attach each
neuron non-sequentially.
Why didn't you just reprogram the
synapses to work collectively?
Because... we didn't think of it?
- I'm sure you did your best.
- Can you do it?
Yes, but there are more than
2 trillion neurons here.
One misalignment could cause a
cascade of circuit failures.
- It will take time, brother.
- How long?
As long as you can give me.
Something's entered
the atmosphere.
Hey Cap, we got a
situation here.
God, I love this place.
Don't start celebrating yet, guys. We
got more incoming outside the dome.
It's too late. We need to
destroy the Stone now.
- Vision, get your ass back on the table.
- We will hold them off.
Wanda, as soon as that stone's out
of his head, you blow it to hell.
I will.
Evacuate the city,
engage all defenses...
and get this man a shield!
I don't think you get
the scientifics here.
These rings are gigantic.

You wanna get them moving,
you need something bigger
to yank them loose!
- Leave that to me.
- Leave it to you?
Buddy, you're in space. All
you got is a wrong plan...
Fire the engines!
More power, rabbit!
Well done, boy.
That's Nidavellir!
- Damn it.
- What's damn it?
- The mechanism is crippled.
- What?
With the iris closed, I
can't heat the metal.
- How long will it take to heat it?
- A few minutes, maybe more. Why?
- I'm gonna hold it open.
- That's suicide.
So is facing Thanos
without that axe.
- How are we looking, Bruce?
- Yeah, I think I'm getting the hang of it.
It's so amazing! It's like being
the Hulk without actually...
I'm okay.
I got two heat signatures
breaking through the treeline.
Thank you for standing with us.
Of course, brother.
Where's the other friend?
He will pay for his
life with yours.
Thanos will have that stone.
That's not gonna happen.
You are in Wakanda now.
Thanos will have nothing
but dust, and blood.
We,
have blood to spare.
- They surrender?
- Not exactly.

Yibambe!
Yibambe!
Yibambe!
What the hell?
Looks like we pissed her off.
They're killing themselves.
See the teeth on those things?
Alright, back up, Sam. They
ain't get your wings yet.
Cap, if these things circle the
perimeter and get in behind us,
there's nothing between
them and Vision.
Then we better keep
them in front of us.
How do we do that?
We open the barrier.
On my signal, open
northwest section 17.
Requesting confirmation, my King.
You said open the barrier?
- On my signal.
- This will be the end of Wakanda.
Then it will be the noblest
ending in history.
Wakanda forever!
Wakanda forever!
Now!
- How much longer, Shuri?
- We've barely begun, brother.
You might want to
pick up the pace.
All fathers, give me strength.
You understand, boy?
You're about to take the
full force of a star.
It'll kill you.
And if I die?
Yes, that's what,
killing you means.
Hold it, hold it, Thor!
Thor? Say something, come on.
Thor, you okay?
- I think he's dying.

- He needs the axe.
Where's the handle?
Tree! Help me find the handle.
There's too many of them!
You guys are so screwed now!
Bring me Thanos!
Oh, yeah.
You're much more of a Thanos.
I take it that Maw is dead?
This day extracts a heavy toll.
Still, he accomplished
his mission.
You may regret that.
He brought you face-to-face with
a Master of the Mystic Arts.
Where do you think
he brought you?
Let me guess.
Your home?
It was.
And it was beautiful.
Titan was like most planets.
Too many mouths,
not enough to go around.
And when we faced extinction,
I offered a solution.
Genocide?
At random. Dispassionate, fair.
The rich and poor alike.
And they called me a madman.
And what I predicted,
came to pass.
Congratulations. You're a prophet.
I'm a survivor.
Who wants to murder trillions.
With all six Stones, I could
simply snap my fingers.
They would all cease to exist.
I call that mercy.
And then what?
I finally rest.
And watch the sun rise
on a grateful universe.
The hardest choices require

the strongest wills.
I think you'll find our
will equal to yours.
"Our"?
- Piece of cake, Quill.
- Yeah, if your goal was to piss him off!
Boom!
Don't let him close his fist.
Magic! More magic!
Magic with a kick!
Magic with a...
Insect.
- Well, well.
- You should have killed me.
Would have been a
waste of parts!
Where's Gamora?
Is he under? Don't let up.
Be quick. He is very strong.
Parker, help. Get over here. She
can't hold him much longer. Let's go.
I thought you'd be harder to catch.
For the record, this was my plan.
Not so strong now, huh?
Where's Gamora?
- My Gamora!
- Oh, bullshit!
Where is she?
- He is in anguish.
- Good.
He...
He mourns.
What does this monster
have to mourn?
Gamora...
What?
He took her to Vormir. He came back
with the Soul Stone. She didn't.
Okay, Quill? You gotta cool
it right now, understand?
Don't. Don't engage.
We almost got this off!
Tell me she's lying.
Asshole! Tell me

you didn't do it.
I had to...
No you didn't.
- No! No, you didn't!
- Quill!
Just stop! Stop!
It's coming, I got it, I got it!
Oh, God.
Come and get some, face-dogs!
Come on! Get some, get some!
- How much for the gun?
- Not for sale.
Okay, how much for the arm?
Oh, I'll get that arm.
- New haircut?
- I notice you've copied my beard.
Oh, by the way, this is a
friend of mine. A tree.
I am Groot!
I am Steve Rogers.
Fall back! Fall back now!
Focus all fire on the
left flank, Sam.
I'm doing it.
Why was she up there
all this time?
She's on the field. Take it.
Guys, we got a Vision
situation here.
- Somebody get to Vision!
- I got him.
On my way.
He'll die alone. As will you.
She's not alone.
Oh, no. Oh, no, you don't.
This isn't gonna be like
New York, pal. This
suit's already kicked the
crap outta the Hulk.
Guys. Vision needs back-up now.
Hulk? I know you're not making your
entrance 'till the last second.
This is it, man. This is
the last, last second.

Hulk! Hulk!
Shit, Hulk!
- No!
- Screw you, you big, green asshole!
I'll do it myself. Come on.
See ya!
Hulk, we got a lot
to figure out, pal.
I thought you were a formidable machine.
But you're dying, like any man.
Get outta here!
Go!
That's really gross.
I thought I told you to go.
We don't trade lives, Captain.
I got you, I got you!
Sorry I can't remember
any of your names.
You're full of tricks, wizard.
But you never once used
your greatest weapon.
A fake.
You throw another moon at
me, and I'm gonna lose it.
- Stark.
- You know me?
I do. You're not the only
one cursed with knowledge.
My only curse is you.
All that for a drop of blood.
You have my respect, Stark.
When I'm done, half of
humanity will still be alive.
I hope they remember you.
Stop.
Spare his life, and I
will give you the Stone.
No tricks.
Don't!
One to go.
Where is he?
Did we just lose?
Why would you do that?
We're in the endgame now.

Are you okay?
What? What is it?
He's here.
Everyone on my position.
We have incoming.
What the hell?
Cap. That's him.
Eyes up. Stay sharp.
Wanda. It's time.
No.
They can't stop him,
Wanda. But we can.
Look at me. You have the
power to destroy the stone.
- Don't.
- You must. Please...
We are out of time.
- I can't.
- Yes, you can. You can.
If he gets this stone,
half the Universe dies.
It's not fair.
It shouldn't be you,
but it is.
It's all right.
You could never hurt me.
I just feel you.
I love you.
I understand, my child.
Better than anyone.
You could never.
Today, I lost more
than you can know.
But now is no time to mourn.
Now...
is no time at all.
No!
I told you...
You'd die for that.
You should have...
You...
You should have
gone for the head!
No!

Daughter?
Did you do it?
Yes.
What did it cost?
Everything.
What did you do?
What did you do?!
Where did he go?
Thor...
Where did he go?
Steve?
Up, General, up!
This is no place to die.
I am Groot...
No.
No. No. No. No! Groot...
No...
Sam?
Sam, where you at?
Something's happening...
Quill?
- Stay, Quill.
- Oh, man...
Tony.
There was no other way.
Mr. Stark?
I don't feel so good...
- You're all right.
- I don't, I don't know what's happening...
I don't wanna go. I don't wanna go.
Mr. Stark, please...
Please. I don't wanna go.
I don't wanna go.
I'm sorry.
He did it.
What is this? What the
hell is happening?
Oh, God.
Subbed by:
Search for Stark.
No not yet.
I'm watching every satellite above
kind of searching Stark over there.

- What is it?
- Multiple bogets from wakanda.
Same energy signatures
as in New York?
10 times bigger.
Call Clint. We'll meet him...
They okay?
There is no one here.
Call control.
Code RED.
Nick.
No!
Oh no!
SENDING...
Captain Marvel.
